In the Petition, it is contended that:\n\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">     2.1. The Petitioner is an IT Engineer, having\n\n          studied in M/s RV College of Engineering,\n\n          Bangalore. He was selected as Software\n\n          Engineer, during the process of on-campus\n\n          recruitment    by       Accenture,     IT   company,\n\n          Bangalore, where he worked for one year and\n\n          thereafter resigned to do his self avocation of\n\n          organising events and parties in 5-star hotels\n\n          and other events by obtaining licence and\n\n          permission from the police department.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">     2.2. It is claimed that the nature of work carried\n\n          out by the Petitioner is only to book the\n\n          participants for the event and the other\n\n          arrangements of food and drinks are made by\n\n          the hotel management, and he had no control\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                       5</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                      WP No.11759/2020</span>\n\n\n\n    of it and even he was not allowed to carry\n\n    anything.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">2.3. The last event organised by the Petitioner\n\n    was in the second week of March 2020 before\n\n    COVID- 19 Pandemic lockdown; thereafter,\n\n    he has not organised any event or party.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">2.4. It is stated that on 3-09-2020, when the\n\n    Petitioner was with his parents in Delhi at\n\n    about 5:00 P.M, some policemen said to be\n\n    from CCB police of Bangalore had visited his\n\n    Delhi residence and insisted on his presence\n\n    in Bangalore for interrogation by CCB police\n\n    and accordingly, he was brought to Bangalore\n\n    on 4-09-2020 by flight.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">2.5. It is claimed that the Petitioner has been\n\n    fixed in an old case in Crime No. 588/ 2018\n\n    of   Banasawadi       police   station,   in   which\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                       6</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                   WP No.11759/2020</span>\n\n\n\n     investigation was completed and the charge\n\n     sheet was filed on 30-04-2019.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">2.6. Petitioner was arrested and produced before\n\n     the XXXIII Addl. City Civil and Sessions Judge\n\n     and Special Judge for NDPS cases Bangalore\n\n     City, on a remand application being filed, he\n\n     was remanded to police custody. On the\n\n     expiry of the said remand, he was once again\n\n     remanded to judicial custody without hearing\n\n     him or his counsel, which is contrary to\n\n     <a href=\"/doc/1687975/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 167</a> of Cr.P.C., and violative of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_4\">Article\n\n     21</a> and <a href=\"/doc/581566/\" id=\"a_5\">22</a> of the Constitution.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">2.7. It is alleged that when he was brought from\n\n     Delhi to Bangalore by the second respondent\n\n     police, he had a mobile phone bearing SIM\n\n     No.8105100009 and the same was seized\n\n     under mahazar on 4-09-2020.

The police had seen the\n\n     mobile phone details and thereafter retained\n\n     the said mobile in police custody itself.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">2.8. It is contended that the prosecution falsely\n\n     alleged before the Special Judge on 14-09-\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_6\">     2020 that the Petitioner is not giving his\n\n     mobile phone password for unlocking his\n\n     mobile when the Court directed the Petitioner\n\n     to co-operate for unlocking the mobile phone.\n\n     It is further stated that the Petitioner co-\n\n     operated with the police in opening his E-mail\n\n     accounts.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_7\">\n2.9. On 16-09-2020, the Petitioner was produced\n\n     before Court and got remanded to Judicial\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                      8</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                   WP No.11759/2020</span>\n\n\n\n    custody because his presence was no more\n\n    required for the police investigation.\n\n\n2.10. On 23-09-2020, the second Respondent, CCB\n\n    police, filed an application before the Special\n\n    Court for an order of permission to subject\n\n    the Petitioner for Polygraph test because he\n\n    has not given mobile phone password for\n\n    unlocking his mobile phone and also for\n\n    getting opened two more E-mail accounts\n\n    belonging to him. This application copy was\n\n    not served either on the counsel for Petitioner\n\n    or on Petitioner, and as soon as it was filed,\n\n    an order dated 23-09-2020 was passed to\n\n    send the Petitioner for Polygraph test as\n\n    prayed in the Application, and it was ordered\n\n    to the Investigation officer of CCB Police\n\n    Bangalore to take the Petitioner for Polygraph\n\n    test with proper escorts by 28-09-2020.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                       9</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                                    WP No.11759/2020</span>\n\n\n\n2.11. It is contended that before passing the order\n\n     dated 23-09-2020 directing a Polygraph test,\n\n     no opportunity was given to Petitioner or his\n\n     counsel to defend the Application filed by CCB\n\n     police for Polygraph test and thereby, the\n\n     order for Polygraph test was not known to\n\n     Petitioner or his counsel.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_8\">\n2.12. It is only on 03-09-2020, the Petitioner&#x27;s\n\n     father was told by his friends that in Media it\n\n     is   being   reported   that   the   Court   has\n\n     permitted a Polygraph test of the Petitioner.\n\n     Petitioner&#x27;s father immediately informed the\n\n     counsel for Petitioner, and thereafter on\n\n     verification, it was found to be true and the\n\n     order dated 23-09-2020 had been passed\n\n     without the Petitioner&#x27;s knowledge.\n\n\n2.13. On 3-10-2020, the Petitioner&#x27;s counsel filed\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                          10</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                                         WP No.11759/2020</span>\n\n\n\n      an application to recall the order of Polygraph\n\n      test dated 23-09-2020 as not tenable in Law\n\n      as it amounts to testimonial compulsion hit\n\n      by <a href=\"/doc/655638/\" id=\"a_6\">Article 20</a> clause (3) of the Constitution.\n\n      He is not consenting to the Polygraph test;\n\n      the order was passed behind the back of the\n\n      Petitioner. Hence it was required to recall the\n\n      order and to give an opportunity of hearing\n\n      regarding the Polygraph test more so when\n\n      the Petitioner was not willing to subject\n\n      himself to such a test.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_9\">\n2.14. This recall application copy was served upon\n\n      Spl.PP on 03-10-2020 and was put up on 05-\n\n      10-2020 before the Special Court, which\n\n      granted time to file objections, which was\n\n      filed on 07-10-2020.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\">\n2.15.

On 02.11.2018, a case was registered in\n\n          Banaswadi Police Station Crime No. 588/2018\n\n          against Faith Phuks and two others for the\n\n          offences punishable under <a href=\"/doc/197387625/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 21(c)</a> of\n\n          Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances\n\n          Act, 1985 and <a href=\"/doc/5353/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 14</a> of Foreigners&#x27; Act.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_12\">          After investigation, keeping open further\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">                         13</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">                                       WP No.11759/2020</span>\n\n\n\n     investigation     interim    final     report   was\n\n     submitted to the Court. In continuation of the\n\n     investigation and obtaining permission of the\n\n     Court for further investigation, the Petitioner\n\n     was apprehended and taken into custody.\n\n     From   the      possession   of      the   Petitioner\n\n     incriminating evidence in the form of Mobile\n\n     Phone, Laptop and other material objects\n\n     seized and the property form prepared.\n\n\n3.2. For the purpose of the investigation, it is\n\n     necessary to open the Mobile Phones, other\n\n     electronic gadgets seized from the Petitioner\n\n     and the e-mails. The same is protected by\n\n     passwords. Investigation Officer called upon\n\n     the Petitioner to furnish the Passwords. The\n\n     Petitioner refused to disclose the password of\n\n     his Mobile Phone and e-Mail addresses. The\n\n     Hon&#x27;ble Trial     Court, by an order dated\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">                       14</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                                    WP No.11759/2020</span>\n\n\n\n     04.09.2020, directed the Petitioner to co-\n\n     operate and furnish the password to the\n\n     investigating officer.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_13\">\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"338008\" id=\"span_25\">3.3. The    order    of    the   Trial   Court   was\n\n     communicated to the Petitioner requesting\n\n     him to furnish the password. In spite of the\n\n     direction by the Trial Court the Petitioner did\n\n     not furnish the password. On the contrary, he\n\n     tried to contend that he has already provided\n\n     the password, without having so provided.\n\n\n3.4. It is on that basis that, Respondent No.2 filed\n\n     an Application seeking permission of the Trial\n\n     Court to subject the Petitioner to Polygraph\n\n     test and the impugned orders passed.\n\n\n3.5.

It is contended that the direction of the Trial\n\n     Court to the Petitioner to co-operate with the\n\n     Investigating Officer and to unlock the mobile\n\n     password is legal.

The contention of the Petitioner that the\n\n     mobile    phone        contains    his   personal\n\n     information which is protected under Right to\n\n     Privacy cannot be accepted, the order of the\n\n     Trial Court directing the Petitioner to co-\n\n     operate in unlocking the mobile phone does\n\n     not violate the Right to Privacy and does not\n\n     amount to testimonial compulsion.\n\n\n3.8.

Even though the actual process of\n    undergoing a polygraph examination or a BEAP\n    test is not the same as that of making an oral or\n    written statement, the consequences are similar.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_19\">    By making inferences from the results of these\n    tests, the examiner is able to derive knowledge\n    from the subject&#x27;s mind which otherwise would\n    not have become available to the investigators.\n    These two tests are different from medical\n    examination and the analysis of bodily\n    substances such as blood, semen and hair\n    samples, since the test subject&#x27;s physiological\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">                     19</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">                                    WP No.11759/2020</span>\n\n\nresponses are directly correlated to mental\nfaculties. Through lie detection or gauging a\nsubject&#x27;s familiarity with the stimuli, personal\nknowledge is conveyed in respect of a relevant\nfact. It is also significant that unlike the case of\ndocuments, the investigators cannot possibly\nhave any prior knowledge of the test subject&#x27;s\nthoughts and memories, either in the actual or\nconstructive sense. Therefore, even if a highly\nstrained analogy were to be made between the\nresults obtained from the impugned tests and\nthe production of documents, the weight of\nprecedents leans towards restrictions on the\nextraction of &quot;personal knowledge&quot; through such\nmeans.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\">185. During the administration of a polygraph\ntest or a BEAP test, the subject makes a mental\neffort which is accompanied by certain\nphysiological responses. The measurement of\nthese responses then becomes the basis of the\ntransmission of knowledge to the investigators.\nThis knowledge may aid an ongoing investigation\nor lead to the discovery of fresh evidence which\ncould then be used to prosecute the test subject.\nIn any case, the compulsory administration of\nthe impugned tests impedes the subject&#x27;s right\nto choose between remaining silent and offering\nsubstantive information. The requirement of a\n&quot;positive volitional act&quot; becomes irrelevant since\nthe subject is compelled to convey personal\nknowledge irrespective of his/her own volition.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_21\">186. Some academics have also argued that the\nresults obtained from tests such as polygraph\nexamination are &quot;testimonial&quot; acts that should\ncome within the prohibition of the right against\nself-incrimination. For instance, Michael S. Pardo\n(2008) has observed [cited from Michael S.\nPardo, &quot;Self-Incrimination and the Epistemology\nof Testimony&quot; [30 Cardozo Law Review 1023-46\n(December 2008)] ,Cardozo Law Review at p.\n1046]:\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">                    20</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_22\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">                                    WP No.11759/2020</span>\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">&quot;The results of polygraphs and other lie detection\ntests, whether they call for a voluntary response\nor not, are testimonial because the tests are just\ninductive evidence of the defendant&#x27;s epistemic\nstate. They are evidence that purports to tell us\neither: (1) that we can or cannot rely on the\nassertions made by the defendant and for which\nhe has represented himself to be an authority, or\n(2) what propositions the defendant would\nassume authority for and would invite reliance\nupon, were he to testify truthfully.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_23\">187. Ronald J. Allen and M. Kristin Mace (2004)\nhave offered a theory that the right against self-\nincrimination is meant to protect an individual in\na situation where the State places reliance on\nthe &quot;substantive results of cognition&quot;. The\nfollowing definition of &quot;cognition&quot; has been\narticulated to explain this position [cited from\nRonald J. Allen and M. Kristin Mace, &quot;The Self-\nIncrimination Clause Explained and its Future\nPredicted&quot; [94 Journal of Criminal Law and\nCriminology 243-293 (2004)], Journal of\nCriminal Law and Criminology, Fn. 16 at p. 247]:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">&quot;...&#x27;cognition&#x27; is used herein to refer to these\nintellectual processes that allow one to gain and\nmake use of substantive knowledge and to\ncompare      one&#x27;s    &#x27;inner    world&#x27;   (previous\nknowledge) with the &#x27;outside world&#x27; (stimuli such\nas questions from an interrogator).

A similar conclusion has also been made by\nthe National Human Rights Commission, as is\nevident from the following extract in the\nGuidelines   Relating   to    Administration  of\nPolygraph Test (Lie Detector Test) on an Accused\n(2000):\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">&quot;The extent and nature of the &#x27;self-incrimination&#x27;\nis wide enough to cover the kinds of statements\nthat were sought to be induced. In M.P. Sharma\n[AIR 1954 SC 300 : 1954 Cri LJ 865 : 1954 SCR\n1077] the Supreme Court included within the\nprotection of the self-incrimination rule all\npositive volitional acts which furnish evidence.\nThis by itself would have made all or any\ninterrogation impossible. The test--as stated in\nKathi Kalu Oghad [AIR 1961 SC 1808 : (1961) 2\nCri LJ 856 : (1962) 3 SCR 10] --retains the\nrequirement of personal volition and states that\n&#x27;self-incrimination&#x27;  must    mean      conveying\ninformation based upon the personal knowledge\nof the person giving information. By either test,\nthe information sought to be elicited in a lie\ndetector test is information in the personal\nknowledge of the accused.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\">189. In light of the preceding discussion, we are\nof the view that the results obtained from tests\nsuch as polygraph examination and the BEAP\ntest should also be treated as &quot;personal\ntestimony&quot;, since they are a means for\n&quot;imparting personal knowledge about relevant\nfacts&quot;. Hence, our conclusion is that the results\nobtained through the involuntary administration\nof either of the impugned tests (i.e. the\nnarcoanalysis technique, polygraph examination\nand the BEAP test) come within the scope of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">                     22</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">                                    WP No.11759/2020</span>\n\n\n&quot;testimonial compulsion&quot;, thereby attracting the\nprotective shield of <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_17\">Article 20(3).</a>\n\nII. Whether the involuntary administration\nof the impugned techniques is a reasonable\nrestriction   on  &quot;personal   liberty&quot;  as\nunderstood in the context of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_18\">Article 21</a> of\nthe Constitution?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_27\">190. The preceding discussion does not\nconclusively address the contentions before us.\n<a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_19\">Article 20(3)</a> protects a person who is &quot;formally\naccused&quot; of having committed an offence or even\na suspect or a witness who is questioned during\nan investigation in a criminal case. However,\n<a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_20\">Article 20(3)</a> is not applicable when a person\ngives his/her informed consent to undergo any of\nthe impugned tests. It has also been described\nearlier that the &quot;right against self-incrimination&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">does not protect persons who may be compelled\nto undergo the tests in the course of\nadministrative    proceedings     or   any    other\nproceedings which may result in civil liability. It\nis also conceivable that a person who is forced to\nundergo these tests may not subsequently face\ncriminal charges. In this context, <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_21\">Article 20(3)</a>\nwill not apply in situations where the test results\ncould    become      the    basis   of   non-penal\nconsequences for the subject such as custodial\nabuse, police surveillance and harassment\namong others.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_28\">191. In order to account for these possibilities,\nwe must examine whether the involuntary\nadministration of any of these tests is compatible\nwith the constitutional guarantee of &quot;substantive\ndue process&quot;. The standard of &quot;substantive due\nprocess&quot; is of course the threshold for examining\nthe validity of all categories of governmental\naction that tend to infringe upon the idea of\n&quot;personal liberty&quot;. We will proceed with this\ninquiry with regard to the various dimensions of\n&quot;personal liberty&quot; as understood in the context of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">                     23</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">                                    WP No.11759/2020</span>\n\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_22\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution, which lays down\nthat:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">&quot;21. Protection of life and personal liberty.--No\nperson shall be deprived of his life or personal\nliberty except according to procedure established\nby Law.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_29\">192. Since administering the impugned tests\nentails the physical confinement of the subject, it\nis important to consider whether they can be\nread into an existing statutory provision. This is\nso because any form of restraint on personal\nliberty, howsoever slight it may be, must have a\nbasis in Law. However, we have already\nexplained how it would not be prudent to read\nthe Explanation to <a href=\"/doc/633996/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 53</a> CrPC in an\nexpansive manner so as to include the impugned\ntechniques. The second line of inquiry is whether\nthe involuntary administration of these tests\noffends certain rights that have been read into\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_24\">Article 21</a> by way of judicial precedents. The\ncontentions before us have touched on aspects\nsuch as the &quot;right to privacy&quot; and the &quot;right\nagainst    cruel,    inhuman      and     degrading\ntreatment&quot;. The third line of inquiry is structured\naround the right to fair trial which is an essential\ncomponent of &quot;personal liberty&quot;.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_30\">193. There are several ways in which the\ninvoluntary administration of either of the\nimpugned tests could be viewed as a restraint on\n&quot;personal liberty&quot;. The most obvious indicator of\nrestraint is the use of physical force to ensure\nthat an unwilling person is confined to the\npremises where the tests are to be conducted.\nFurthermore, the drug-induced revelations or the\nsubstantive    inferences   drawn     from   the\nmeasurement of the subject&#x27;s physiological\nresponses can be described as an intrusion into\nthe subject&#x27;s mental privacy. It is also quite\nconceivable that a person could make an\nincriminating statement on being threatened\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_44\">                    24</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">                                   WP No.11759/2020</span>\n\n\nwith the prospective administration of any of\nthese techniques. Conversely, a person who has\nbeen forcibly subjected to these techniques could\nbe confronted with the results in a subsequent\ninterrogation, thereby eliciting incriminating\nstatements.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_31\">203. This line of precedents shows that the\ncompelled extraction of blood samples in the\ncourse of a medical examination does not\namount to &quot;conduct that shocks the conscience&quot;.\nThere is also an endorsement of the view that\nthe use of &quot;force as may be reasonably\nnecessary&quot; is mandated by Law and hence it\nmeets the threshold of &quot;procedure established by\nlaw&quot;. In this light, we must restate two crucial\nconsiderations that are relevant for the case\nbefore us. Firstly, the restrictions placed on\n&quot;personal liberty&quot; in the course of administering\nthe impugned techniques are not limited to\nphysical confinement and the extraction of bodily\nsubstances. All the three techniques in question\nalso involve testimonial responses. Secondly,\nmost of the abovementioned cases were decided\nin accordance with the threshold of &quot;procedure\nestablished by law&quot; for restraining &quot;personal\nliberty&quot;. However, in this case we must use a\nbroader standard of reasonableness to evaluate\nthe validity of the techniques in question. This\nwider inquiry calls for deciding whether they are\ncompatible with the various judicially recognised\ndimensions of &quot;personal liberty&quot; such as the right\nto privacy, the right against cruel, inhuman or\ndegrading treatment and the right to fair trial.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_32\">226. Therefore, it is our considered opinion that\nsubjecting a person to the impugned techniques\nin an involuntary manner violates the prescribed\nboundaries of privacy. Forcible interference with\na person&#x27;s mental processes is not provided for\nunder any statute and it most certainly comes\ninto conflict with the &quot;right against self-\nincrimination&quot;. However, this determination does\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">                         25</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">                                        WP No.11759/2020</span>\n\n\n     not account for circumstances where a person\n     could be subjected to any of the impugned tests\n     but not exposed to criminal charges and the\n     possibility of conviction. In such cases, he/she\n     could still face adverse consequences such as\n     custodial abuse, surveillance, undue harassment\n     and social stigma among others. In order to\n     address such circumstances, it is important to\n     examine some other dimensions of <a href=\"/doc/1456610/\" id=\"a_25\">Article 2.</a>\n\n     Conclusion\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_33\">     262. In our considered opinion, the compulsory\n     administration of the impugned techniques\n     violates the &quot;right against self-incrimination&quot;.\n     This is because the underlying rationale of the\n     said right is to ensure the reliability as well as\n     voluntariness of statements that are admitted as\n     evidence. This Court has recognised that the\n     protective scope of <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_26\">Article 20(3)</a> extends to the\n     investigative stage in criminal cases and when\n     read with <a href=\"/doc/1110422/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 161(2)</a> of the Code of Criminal\n     Procedure, 1973 it protects accused persons,\n     suspects as well as witnesses who are examined\n     during an investigation. The test results cannot\n     be admitted in evidence if they have been\n     obtained through the use of compulsion. <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_28\">Article\n     20(3)</a> protects an individual&#x27;s choice between\n     speaking and remaining silent, irrespective of\n     whether the subsequent testimony proves to be\n     inculpatory or exculpatory. <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_29\">Article 20(3)</a> aims to\n     prevent the forcible &quot;conveyance of personal\n     knowledge that is relevant to the facts in issue&quot;.\n     The results obtained from each of the impugned\n     tests bear a &quot;testimonial&quot; character and they\n     cannot be categorised as material evidence.&quot;\n\n\n\n4.3. The Petitioner is not willing or consenting for\n\n     Polygraph      Test,    had     there     been       an\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">                           26</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">                                            WP No.11759/2020</span>\n\n\n\n     opportunity provided to the Petitioner before\n\n     passing the impugned order dated 23-9-\n\n     2020, he would have mentioned the stand of\n\n     &#x27;no   consent     for          Polygraph     Test&#x27;.

The nine primary types of\nprivacy are, according to the above depiction:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">(i) bodily privacy which reflects the privacy of\nthe physical body. Implicit in this is the negative\nfreedom of being able to prevent others from\nviolating one&#x27;s body or from restraining the\nfreedom of bodily movement;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">(ii) spatial privacy which is reflected in the\nprivacy of a private space through which access\nof others can be restricted to the space;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_39\">intimate relations and family life are an apt\nillustration of spatial privacy;\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_40\">(iii) communicational privacy which is reflected\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_59\">                  31</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_60\">                                 WP No.11759/2020</span>\n\n\nin enabling an individual to restrict access to\ncommunications or control the use            of\ninformation which is communicated to third\nparties;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_41\">(iv) proprietary privacy which is reflected by the\ninterest of a person in utilising property as a\nmeans to shield facts, things or information\nfrom others;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_42\">(v) intellectual privacy which is reflected as an\nindividual interest in the privacy of thought and\nmind and the development of opinions and\nbeliefs;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_43\">(vi) decisional privacy reflected by an ability to\nmake intimate decisions primarily consisting\none&#x27;s sexual or procreative nature and decisions\nin respect of intimate relations;\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_44\">(vii) associational privacy which is reflected in\nthe ability of the individual to choose who she\nwishes to interact with;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_45\">(viii) behavioural privacy which recognises the\nprivacy interests of a person even while\nconducting      publicly    visible   activities.\nBehavioural privacy postulates that even when\naccess is granted to others, the individual is\nentitled to control the extent of access and\npreserve to herself a measure of freedom from\nunwanted intrusion; and\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_46\">(ix) informational privacy which reflects       an\ninterest in preventing information about the   self\nfrom being disseminated and controlling        the\nextent of access to information.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_61\">                        32</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_62\">                                      WP No.11759/2020</span>\n\n\n\n4.12.

Since the right to privacy is recognised as a\n\n     fundamental right under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_35\">Article 21</a> of the\n\n     Constitution, to take away this fundamental\n\n     right, even of an accused, there must be a\n\n     law enacted by Parliament and the Law must\n\n     meet the test of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_36\">Article 21</a> as laid down in\n\n     Maneka Gandhi&#x27;s case i.e., it must be just,\n\n     fair and reasonable not illusory.\n\n\n4.14.

In the absence\n\n     of this, the order of the Special Court dated\n\n     14-9-2020 is not sustainable in Law.\n\n\nSelf Incrimination\n\n\n\n4.15. Even during police interrogation, the accused\n\n     is entitled to remain silent, therefore insisting\n\n     on revealing passcode or to unlock his mobile\n\n     phone and to open his E-mail accounts\n\n     amounts to compelling him to be a witness\n\n     against himself, which is in violation of\n\n     <a href=\"/doc/1110422/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 161 (2)</a> of the Code of Criminal\n\n     Procedure and also under <a href=\"/doc/655638/\" id=\"a_38\">articles 20</a> clause\n\n     (3) and 21 of the Constitution.

Without this additional warning,\nthe admonition of the right to consult with counsel\nwould often be understood as meaning only that\nhe can consult with a lawyer if he has one or has\nthe funds to obtain one. The warning of a right to\ncounsel would be hollow if not couched in terms\nthat would convey to the indigent--the person\nmost often subjected to interrogation--the\nknowledge that he too has a right to have counsel\npresent. As with the warnings of the right to\nremain silent and of the general right to counsel,\nonly by effective and express explanation to the\nindigent of this right can there be assurance that\nhe was truly in a position to exercise it.\n\nOnce warnings have been given, the subsequent\nprocedure is clear. If the individual indicates in\nany manner, at any time prior to or during\nquestioning, that he wishes to remain silent, the\ninterrogation must cease. At this point he has\nshown that he intends to exercise his Fifth\nAmendment privilege; any statement taken after\nthe person invokes his privilege cannot be other\nthan the product of compulsion, subtle or\notherwise. Without the right to cut off\nquestioning,     the    setting    of   in-custody\ninterrogation operates on the individual to\novercome free choice in producing a statement\nafter the privilege has been once invoked. If the\nindividual states that he wants an attorney, the\ninterrogation must cease until an attorney is\npresent. At that time, the individual must have an\nopportunity to confer with the attorney and to\nhave him present during any subsequent\nquestioning. If the individual cannot obtain an\nattorney and he indicates that he wants one\nbefore speaking to police, they must respect his\ndecision to remain silent.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_67\">                         35</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_48\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_68\">                                        WP No.11759/2020</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_49\">       This does not mean, as some have suggested,\n       that each police station must have a &#x27;station\n       house lawyer&#x27; present at all times to advise\n       prisoners. It does mean, however, that if police\n       propose to interrogate a person they must\n       make known to him that he is entitled to a\n       lawyer and that if he cannot afford one, a\n       lawyer will be provided for him prior to any\n       interrogation. If authorities conclude that they\n       will not provide counsel during a reasonable\n       period of time in which investigation in the\n       field is carried out, they may refrain from doing\n       so     without    violating  the    person&#x27;s Fifth\n       Amendment privilege so long as they do not\n       question him during that time.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_50\">\n4.16.

The taking of\nimpressions of parts of the body of an accused\nperson very often becomes necessary to help\nthe investigation of a crime. It is as much\nnecessary to protect an accused person against\nbeing compelled to incriminate himself, as to\narm the agents of Law and the law courts with\nlegitimate powers to bring offenders to justice.\nFurthermore it must be assumed that the\nConstitution-makers were aware of the existing\nLaw, for example, <a href=\"/doc/770022/\" id=\"a_54\">Section 73</a> of the Evidence\nAct or <a href=\"/doc/1391184/\" id=\"a_55\">Sections 5</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1675084/\" id=\"a_56\">6</a> of the Identification of\nPrisoners Act (33 of 1920). <a href=\"/doc/94717/\" id=\"a_57\">Section 5</a>\nauthorises a Magistrate to direct any person to\nallow his measurements or photographs to be\ntaken, if he is satisfied that it is expedient for\nthe    purposes    of any       investigation     or\nproceeding under the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_58\">Code of Criminal\nProcedure</a> to do so: &quot;Measurements&quot; include\nfinger impressions and foot-print impressions.\nIf any such person who is directed by a\nMagistrate, under <a href=\"/doc/94717/\" id=\"a_59\">Section 5</a> of the Act, to allow\nhis measurements or photographs to be taken\nresists or refuses to allow the taking of the\nmeasurements or photographs, it has been\ndeclared lawful by <a href=\"/doc/1536853/\" id=\"a_60\">Section 6</a> to use all\nnecessary means to secure the taking of the\nrequired    measurements        or    photographs.\nSimilarly, <a href=\"/doc/770022/\" id=\"a_61\">Section 73</a> of the Evidence Act\nauthorises the Court to permit the taking of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_86\">                44</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_87\">                               WP No.11759/2020</span>\n\n\nfinger impression or a specimen handwriting or\nsignature of a person present in Court, if\nnecessary for the purpose of comparison.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">11. The matter may be looked at from another\npoint of view. The giving of finger impression\nor of specimen signature or of handwriting,\nstrictly speaking, is not &quot;to be a witness&quot;. &quot;To\nbe a witness&quot; means imparting knowledge in\nrespect of relevant facts, by means of oral\nstatements or statements in writing, by a\nperson who has personal knowledge of the\nfacts to be communicated to a court or to a\nperson holding an enquiry or investigation. A\nperson is said &quot;to be a witness&quot; to a certain\nstate of facts which has to be determined by a\ncourt or authority authorised to come to a\ndecision, by testifying to what he has seen, or\nsomething he has heard which is capable of\nbeing heard and is not hit by the rule excluding\nhearsay, or giving his opinion, as an expert, in\nrespect of matters in controversy. Evidence\nhas been classified by text writers into three\ncategories, namely, (1) oral testimony; (2)\nevidence furnished by documents; and (3)\nmaterial evidence. We have already indicated\nthat we are in agreement with the Full Court\ndecision in Sharma case [(1954) SCR 1077]\nthat the prohibition in clause (3) of <a href=\"/doc/655638/\" id=\"a_62\">Article 20</a>\ncovers not only oral testimony given by a\nperson accused of an offence but also his\nwritten statements which may have a bearing\non the controversy with reference to the\ncharge against him. The accused may have\ndocumentary evidence in his possession which\nmay throw some light on the controversy. If it\nis a document which is not his statement\nconveying his personal knowledge relating to\nthe charge against him, he may be called upon\nby the Court to produce that document in\naccordance with the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/334170/\" id=\"a_63\">Section 139</a>\nof the Evidence Act, which, in terms, provides\nthat a person may be summoned to produce a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_88\">                45</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_89\">                               WP No.11759/2020</span>\n\n\ndocument in his possession or power and that\nhe does not become a witness by the mere fact\nthat he has produced it; and therefore, he\ncannot be cross-examined. Of course, he can\nbe cross-examined if he is called as a witness\nwho has made statements conveying his\npersonal knowledge by reference to the\ncontents of the document or if he has given his\nstatements in Court otherwise than by\nreference to the contents of the documents. In\nour opinion, therefore, the observations of this\nCourt in Sharma case [(1954) SCR 1077] that\n<a href=\"/doc/334170/\" id=\"a_64\">Section 139</a> of the Evidence Act has no bearing\non the connotation of the word &quot;witness&quot; is not\nentirely well-founded in Law. It is well\nestablished that clause (3) of <a href=\"/doc/655638/\" id=\"a_65\">Article 20</a> is\ndirected against self-incrimination by an\naccused person. Self-incrimination must mean\nconveying information based upon the personal\nknowledge of the person giving the information\nand cannot include merely the mechanical\nprocess of producing documents in Court which\nmay throw a light on any of the points in\ncontroversy, but which do not contain any\nstatement of the accused based on his\npersonal knowledge. For example, the accused\nperson may be in possession of a document\nwhich is in his writing or which contains his\nsignature or his thumb impression. The\nproduction of such a document, with a view to\ncomparison of the writing or the signature or\nthe impression, is not the statement of an\naccused person, which can be said to be of the\nnature of a personal testimony. When an\naccused person is called upon by the Court or\nany other authority holding an investigation to\ngive his finger impression or signature or a\nspecimen of his handwriting, he is not giving\nany testimony of the nature of a &quot;personal\ntestimony&quot;. The giving of a &quot;personal\ntestimony&quot; must depend upon his volition. He\ncan make any kind of statement or may refuse\nto make any statement. But his finger\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_90\">                46</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_91\">                              WP No.11759/2020</span>\n\n\nimpressions or his handwriting, in spite of\nefforts at concealing the true nature of it by\ndissimulation cannot change their intrinsic\ncharacter.   Thus,   the   giving   of  finger\nimpressions or of specimen writing or of\nsignatures by an accused person, though it\nmay amount to furnishing evidence in the\nlarger sense, is not included within the\nexpression &quot;to be a witness&quot;.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_62\">12. In order that a testimony by an accused\nperson may be said to have been self-\nincriminatory, the compulsion of which comes\nwithin the prohibition of the constitutional\nprovision, it must be of such a character that\nby itself it should have the tendency of\nincriminating the accused, if not also of\nactually doing so. In other words, it should be\na statement which makes the case against the\naccused person at least probable, considered\nby itself. A specimen handwriting or signature\nor finger impressions by themselves are no\ntestimony at all, being wholly innocuous\nbecause they are unchangeable except in rare\ncases where the ridges of the fingers or the\nstyle of writing have been tampered with. They\nare only materials for comparison in order to\nlend assurance to the Court that its inference\nbased an other pieces of evidence is reliable.\nThey are neither oral nor documentary\nevidence but belong to the third category of\nmaterial evidence which is outside the limit of\n&quot;testimony&quot;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_63\">13. Similarly, during the investigation of a\ncrime by the police, if an accused person were\nto point out the place where the corpus delicti\nwas lying concealed and in pursuance of such\nan information being given by an accused\nperson, discovery is made within the meaning\nof <a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_66\">Section 27</a> of the Evidence Act, such\ninformation and the discovery made as a result\nof the information may be proved in evidence\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_92\">                 47</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_93\">                                WP No.11759/2020</span>\n\n\neven though it may tend to incriminate the\nperson giving the information, while in police\ncustody. Unless it is held that the provisions of\n<a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_67\">Section 27</a> of the Evidence Act, insofar as they\nmake it admissible evidence which has the\ntendency to incriminate the giver of the\ninformation, are unconstitutional as coming\nwithin the prohibition of clause (3) of <a href=\"/doc/655638/\" id=\"a_68\">Article\n20</a>, such information would amount to\nfurnishing evidence. This Court in Sharma case\nwas not concerned with pronouncing upon the\nconstitutionality of the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_69\">Section 27</a>\nof the Evidence Act. It could not, therefore, be\nsaid to have laid it down that such evidence\ncould not be adduced by the prosecution at the\ntrial of the giver of the information for an\nalleged crime. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"481284\" id=\"span_94\">The question whether <a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_70\">Section\n27</a> of the Evidence Act was unconstitutional\nbecause it offended <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_71\">Article 14</a> of the\nConstitution was considered by this Court in\nthe case of <a href=\"/doc/481284/\" id=\"a_72\">State of Uttar Pradesh v. Deomen\nUpadhyaya</a>. It was held by this Court that\n<a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_73\">Section 27</a> of the Evidence Act did not offend\n<a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_74\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution and was,\ntherefore, intra vires. But the question whether\nit was unconstitutional because it contravened\nthe provisions of clause (3) of <a href=\"/doc/655638/\" id=\"a_75\">Article 20</a> was\nnot considered <a href=\"/doc/481284/\" id=\"a_76\">in that case</a>. That question\nmay, therefore, be treated as an open one.\nThe question has been raised in one of the\ncases before us and has, therefore, to be\ndecided. The information given by an accused\nperson to a police officer leading to the\ndiscovery of a fact which may or may not\nprove incriminatory has been made admissible\nin evidence by that section. If it is not\nincriminatory of the person giving the\ninformation, the question does not arise. It can\narise only when it is of an incriminatory\ncharacter so far as the giver of the information\nis    concerned.    If   the    self-incriminatory\ninformation has been given by an accused\nperson without any threat, that will be\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_95\">                 48</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_96\">                                WP No.11759/2020</span>\n\n\nadmissible in evidence and that will not be hit\nby the provisions of clause (3) of <a href=\"/doc/655638/\" id=\"a_77\">Article 20</a> of\nthe Constitution for the reason that there has\nbeen no compulsion. It must, therefore, be\nheld that the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_78\">Section 27</a> of the\nEvidence Act are not within the prohibition\naforesaid, unless compulsion had been used in\nobtaining the information.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_64\">16. In view of these considerations, we have\ncome to the following conclusions:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">(1) An accused person cannot be said to have\nbeen compelled to be a witness against himself\nsimply because he made a statement while in\npolice custody, without anything more. In\nother words, the mere fact of being in police\ncustody at the time when the statement in\nquestion was made would not, by itself, as a\nproposition of Law, lend itself to the inference\nthat the accused was compelled to make the\nstatement, though that fact, in conjunction\nwith other circumstances disclosed in evidence\nin a particular case, would be a relevant\nconsideration in an enquiry whether or not the\naccused person had been compelled to make\nthe impugned statement.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_38\">(2) The mere questioning of an accused person\nby a police officer, resulting in a voluntary\nstatement, which may ultimately turn out to be\nincriminatory, is not &quot;compulsion&quot;.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_39\">(3) &quot;To be a witness&quot; is not equivalent to\n&quot;furnishing evidence&quot; in its widest significance;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_65\">that is to say, as including not merely making\nof oral or written statements but also\nproduction of documents or giving materials\nwhich may be relevant at a trial to determine\nthe guilt or innocence of the accused.\n\n(4) Giving thumb impressions or impressions\nof foot or palm or fingers or specimen writings\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_97\">                        49</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_98\">                                        WP No.11759/2020</span>\n\n\n       or showing parts of the body by way of\n       identification are not included in the expression\n       &quot;to be a witness&quot;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_66\">       (5) &quot;To be a witness&quot; means imparting\n       knowledge in respect of relevant facts by an\n       oral statement or a statement in writing, made\n       or given in Court or otherwise.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_67\">       (6) &quot;To be a witness&quot; in its ordinary\n       grammatical      sense     means giving  oral\n       testimony in Court. Case law has gone beyond\n       this strict literal interpretation of the\n       expression which may now bear a wider\n       meaning, namely, bearing testimony in Court\n       or out of Court by a person accused of an\n       offence, orally or in writing.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_68\">       (7) To bring the statement in question within\n       the prohibition of <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_79\">Article 20(3)</a>, the person\n       accused must have stood in the character of an\n       accused person at the time he made the\n       statement. It is not enough that he should\n       become an accused, any time after the\n       statement has been made.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_69\">\n\n5.9.

The voice sample is not a\ntestimony in itself since it only constitutes what\nwas described as &quot;identification data&quot;. A voice\nsample, in the view of the High Court is not a\nsubstantive piece of evidence. The High Court\nrejected the submission that the direction to\nfurnish a voice sample was in violation of the\nfundamental right under <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_106\">Article 20(3)</a> of the\nConstitution since firstly, the appellants had not\nbeen forced or coerced into furnishing such a\nsample since it was they who had furnished their\nconsent; secondly, a voice sample is not\nevidence since its purpose is only to compare it\nwith the questioned text.

The requirement of\na fair investigation, it was urged, is implicit in\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_108\">Article 21</a> and the procedure which is adopted for\ndrawing a voice sample must be fair and\nreasonable.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_55\">9.

The\n\n    effect and impact of the polygraph test\n\n    and   any   answers    given   during   the\n\n    conduct of the polygraph test has to be\n\n    clearly made known to the said person.\n\n    The consent in writing to be obtained\n\n    from such person before directing the\n\n    administration     of the polygraph test.\n\n    Mere silence of the said person would\n\n    not amount to consent on behalf of such\n\n    person. If a person were to refuse the\n\n    administration of polygraph test, no such\n\n    polygraph test could be administered\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_285\">                            136</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_286\">                                        WP No.11759/2020</span>\n\n\n\n            and even if administered, the result of\n\n            the said test would be void and cannot\n\n            be considered by a Court of Law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_180\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_181\">20.
