A perusal of  Section \n\n     28 of the  PC-PNDT Act clearly shows that no court can take cognizance of \n\n\n\n\n\n     an   offence   under   this   Act   except   on   a   complaint   made   by     (a)   the \n\n     Appropriate Authority concerned, or any officer authorized in this behalf \n\n\n\n\n\n     by the Central Government or State Government, as the case may be, or \n\n     the Appropriate Authority ; or   (b) a person after giving notice of not less \n\n     than fifteen days in the manner prescribed, to the Appropriate Authority, \n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">                                                              ::: Downloaded on - 22/06/2014 23:29:49 :::</span>\n                                                   20/27                                             wp.4164.2013.doc\n\n\n     of the alleged commission of an offence and of his intention to make a \n\n\n\n\n                                                                                            \n     complaint to the Court.

It is evident from the statement of objects and reasons, that the \n\n     said   Act   was   enacted   to   prohibit   pre-natal   diagnostic   techniques   for \n      \n\n     determination   of   sex   of   the   foetus   leading   to   female   foeticide,   as   such \n   \n\n\n\n     abuse   of   techniques,   discriminates   against   the   female   sex,   thereby \n\n     affecting the dignity and status of women and     for other reasons as set \n\n\n\n\n\n     out in para 6 of the judgment. It is thus evident, that if an Appropriate \n\n     Authority     or   any   officer   authorized   in   this   behalf   by   the   Central \n\n     Government or State Government, as the case may be, or the Appropriate \n\n\n\n\n\n     Authority   fails   in   its   duty   to   lodge   a   complaint   for   violation   of   the \n\n     provisions of the said Act/Rules,  a &#x27;person&#x27; has been given locus under the \n\n     said Act to lodge a complaint in the appropriate Court for violation of the \n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">                                                              ::: Downloaded on - 22/06/2014 23:29:49 :::</span>\n                                                    21/27                                             wp.4164.2013.doc\n\n\n     provisions of the said Act/Rules framed thereunder,, by giving notice in \n\n\n\n\n                                                                                             \n     the   manner   prescribed,   to   the   Appropriate   Authority   of   the   alleged \n\n\n\n\n                                                               \n     violation of the Act.  Thus, the legislation gives locus to a &#x27;person&#x27; to make \n\n     a complaint to the Court of the alleged commission of offences under the \n\n     PC-PNDT Act, where the Appropriate Authority fails in its duty.

The question that \n                         \n     arises for consideration in the present case is whether the word &#x27;may&#x27; as it \n\n     appears in sub-<a href=\"/doc/47577/\" id=\"a_27\">section 3</a> of <a href=\"/doc/1934622/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 28</a> of   the said Act can   be  read  as \n      \n\n     &#x27;shall&#x27;   or   whether   there   is   a     discretion   vested   in   the   Court   to   make \n   \n\n\n\n     available   the   copies   of   the   relevant   records   in   the   possession   of   the \n\n     appropriate authority,  to such a person.  If the word &#x27;may&#x27; as submitted by \n\n\n\n\n\n     Mr.Warunjikar is read as &#x27;shall&#x27; leaving no discretion in the Magistrate to \n\n     make   available   the   copies   of   all   the   records   in   the     possession   of   the \n\n     appropriate authority,   then the question will arise whether by handing \n\n\n\n\n\n     over of such records, the right of privacy of persons involved is affected, \n\n     more particularly, when no foundation whatsoever is laid for handing over \n\n     the said records.

No   doubt,   it   is   well   settled   that   the   word   &#x27;may&#x27;   is   capable   of \n\n     meaning &#x27;must&#x27; or &#x27;shall&#x27;  in the light of the context but that would depend \n      \n\n     upon the legislation, its object and several other factors.   Normally, the \n   \n\n\n\n     word &#x27;may&#x27; is used to grant a discretion and not to indicate a mandatory \n\n     direction. It is also true that the word &#x27;may&#x27; in some context, has been \n\n\n\n\n\n     interpreted as containing a mandatory direction and the authority given \n\n     the power has to exercise that power unless there are special reasons.  The \n\n     word &#x27;may&#x27; is often read as &#x27;shall&#x27; or &#x27;must&#x27; when there is something in the \n\n\n\n\n\n     nature of the thing to be done which makes it the duty of the person on \n\n     whom the power is conferred to exercise the power.

The right to privacy of an individual is a part of right to &#x27;life&#x27; \n\n     and   &#x27;personal   liberty&#x27;   which   is   enshrined   under   <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_31\">Article   21</a>   of   the \n\n\n\n\n\n     Constitution.

However, it \n\n     is   for   the   Magistrate   to   consider   all   the   factors,   including   the   right   of \n\n\n\n\n                                                              \n     privacy   of   the   stakeholders.
