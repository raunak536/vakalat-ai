This is an application under Section 482 read with <a href=\"/doc/1457888/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 397</a>/<a href=\"/doc/1571667/\" id=\"a_2\">401</a> of\nCode of Criminal Procedure, 1973, against the order dated 28.02.2020 passed\nby the learned Special Judge, CBI, Guwahati, Assam in CBI Case No. RC-\n05(A)/2018/CBI/ACB /Guwahati, whereby, the learned Special Judge rejected\nthe prayer of the prosecution to take voice samples of the accused persons,\ni.e. respondent Nos. 1, 2, 3 &amp; 6.\n\n\n3.    It is stated that the CBI, Anti-Corruption Branch (ACB), Guwahati\nregistered an FIR No. 05(A)/2018 on 11.04.2018 under <a href=\"/doc/1737367/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 7</a>, <a href=\"/doc/819628/\" id=\"a_4\">11</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1519768/\" id=\"a_5\">12</a> &amp;\n<a href=\"/doc/1169411/\" id=\"a_6\">13(2)</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/178303/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 13(1)(d)</a> of Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 and\nread with <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 120B</a> of the Indian Penal Code against Shri Swetabh Suman,\nCIT (Appeal); Shri Pratap Das, Income Tax Officer (Audit), Guwahati; Shri\nRamesh Goenka, Advocate; Shri Amit Goenka; Shri Suresh Kumar Agarwala,\nDirector of M/s Win Power Infra Pvt. Ltd.; and some unknown others on the\nallegation of taking illegal gratification and criminal misconduct. Accordingly,\non 17.04.2018, a prayer was made before the Court of learned Special Judge,\nCBI for permission to obtain voice samples of the accused persons, namely,\nShri Swetabh Suman, Shri Ramesh Goenka, Shri Pranjal Sarmah and Pratap\nDas and vide order dated on 19.04.2018, the prayer of the CBI was rejected\nfor recording voice samples of the accused persons for spectrograph tests.\n\n\n4.   On being aggrieved by the Order passed by the learned Special Judge,\nCBI, one criminal revision petition No. 195/2018 was filed before this Court\nagainst the said impugned order. During the pendency of the said revision\npetition before this Court, the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court passed an order in\n                                                                      Page No.# 5/37\n\nRitesh Sinha vs. State of Uttar Pradesh &amp; Anr. (Criminal Appeal No.\n2003 of 2012), wherein the Apex Court mentioned that the Magistrate has\nthe power to pass the order directing the accused to give voice samples.\n\n\n5.    Accordingly, in view of the light of the legal development before the full\nbench of Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court, CBI filed a fresh application before the learned\nSpecial Judge on 15.10.2019 with a prayer for recording the voice samples of\nthe accused persons along with 2(two) other remaining accused persons,\nnamely, Balraj Dayma and Pranjal Sarmah whose culpability surfaced during\nthe investigation. Thereafter, the criminal revision petition pending before this\nCourt was withdrawn on 07.11.2019 and the application was made before the\nlearned Special Judge for permission to obtain the voice samples of the\naccused persons.\n\n\n6.   However, the learned Special Judge, after hearing both sides, dismissed\nthe petition vide impugned judgment and order dated 28.02.2020 citing the\nreason that prosecution/CBI failed the test to ascertain that the interceptions\nof Tele-conversion so made were carried out in an illegal way and further\nobserved that &quot;the case diary do not indicate as to whether complete due and\nproper procedure has been followed with regard to the telephone tapping in\nthis case in terms of the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_9\">section 5(2)</a> of the Indian Telegraph Act,\n1885, Rule 419 of the Telegraph rules and the principles laid down by the\nSupreme Court.&quot;\n\n\n7.    The submission on behalf of the petitioner is that the learned Special\nJudge, while dismissing the petition of CBI, clearly overlooked the provisions\n                                                                    Page No.# 6/37\n\nof <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 5(2)</a> of the Indian Telegraph Act R/w Section 419-A of Indian\nTelegraph Rules Amendment in 2007, which authorize Law Enforcement\nAgencies to seek for the legal interception of Telephonic conversions in\nconnection with offences of serious nature. The Indian Telegraph amendment\nrules further provides that all requests for such interceptions would only be\nconsider after due examination/screening by the reviewing committee as set\nup under the provision of said rules, headed by the Cabinet Secretary,\nGovernment of India, considering of Secretary to Government of India,\nDepartment of Telecommunications.\n\n\n8.   Mr. Haloi, learned Special Public Prosecutor, CBI submitted that out of 13\nnumbers of letter of permission for interceptions, 08 permissions granted by\nIndian Home Secretary to the Government of India and 05 permission issued\nby the Worthy Director CBI after duly examining the request and considering\nthe fact that interceptions were sought in the interest of public order and\nsafety and to prevent incitement to the commission of an offence. The said\npermissions were considered under the provisions of Indian Telegraph Rules\n\nAmendment in 2007, introduced by GSR. 193 of 1 st March&#x27;2007. Thus, due\nprocedure prescribed by law was fully complied with while intercepting Tele\nconversion of phone number of the accused persons.\n\n\n9.   Mr. Haloi further submitted that while passing the order, the learned\nSpecial Judge had relied on the judgment of Hon&#x27;ble Bombay High Court in\ncase of Vinit Kumar vs. CBI, whereby the order for destruction of record of\ninterceptions was passed, but the learned Special Judge failed to consider the\nfact that the said judgment is different and also not relevant in the present\n                                                                         Page No.# 7/37\n\ncase and cannot bind on the learned Special Judge, CBI, Guwahati.\n\n\n10.   Mr. Haloi further submitted that in the instant case, there is a demand\nfor bribe by Shri Swetabh Suman, Commissioner of Income Tax (Audit),\nGuwahati with an additional charge of CIT (Appeal), Jorhat, through Shri\nRamesh Goenka, Advocate and Tax consultant, Shri Amit Goenka, Advocate\nand Tax consultant, Guwahati from Shri Suresh Agarwala, Director of M/s Win\nPower Infra Pvt. Ltd., Jorhat for showing undue favour to Shri Suresh\nAgarwala   by   passing   favourable   order   in   an   appeal   No.    CIT    (A),\nJorhat/10027/2017-18, arising out of assessment done in respect of M/s Win\nPower Infra Pvt. Ltd.\n\n\n11. He further submitted that the aforesaid demand of bribe amount of Rs.\n50 Lakhs by the accused- Shri Swetabh Suman, CIT (Appeal) and the\nsubsequent negotiated bribe amount settled at Rs. 40 Lakhs, which is\nmentioned in the FIR, and the details of handing over the bribe money is in\nthe form of detailed recorded telephonic conversation between Shri Swetabh\nSuman and Shri Ramesh Goenka and vice versa and also conversations in\nbetween other accused persons involved in the said criminal conspiracy from\nthe time of demand of the bribe till the time of recovery of bribe money etc.,\nwere recorded by telephonic conversations. As there is no eye witness to\nprove the demand of bribe money from M/s Win Power Infra Pvt. Ltd., the\nintercepted conversations of these accused persons taken as per provision of\nRule 419-A of Indian Telegraph Rules Amendment in 2007. Accordingly, the\npermissions were also received from the competent authority and hence, it is\nrequired to take the voice samples to compare the same with the questioned\n                                                                        Page No.# 8/37\n\nvoice samples as this is very vital evidence which will prove the case beyond\nreasonable doubt in the interest of justice.\n\n\n12.   Accordingly, on being highly aggrieved and dissatisfied with the order\ndated 28.02.2020 passed by the learned Special Judge, CBI, ACB, Guwahati, in\ncase No. RC-05(A)/2018, the petitioner/CBI preferred the present criminal\npetition for setting aside and quashing of the order passed by the learned\nSpecial Judge, Guwahati.\n\n\n13. Mr. Haloi further submitted that the learned Special Judge, CBI, Guwahati\npassed the impugned order mechanically and has rejected the petition\nsummarily without going into the merit of the prayer and as such, the order is\nliable to the set aside and quashed. He further submitted that the drawing of\nvoice samples of the accused persons is very much necessary for proper\ninvestigation of the matter and to compare the same with recorded voice of\nthe accused persons which is fair and reasonable having due regard to the\nmandate of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_11\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India, but the learned Special\nJudge did not consider all these aspects of the case and rejected the prayer of\nthe petitioner which bad in law and liable to be set aside and quashed. The\nlearned Special Judge failed to appreciate the fact that the voice samples is\nvery vital evidence to prove the case as in such type of cases other\ncorroborative evidence are rare. Accordingly, Mr. Haloi, submitted that it is a fit\ncase wherein the Judgment and order passed by the learned Special Judge,\nCBI is liable to be set aside and quashed.\n\n14. On the other hand, the learned counsels appearing on behalf of all the\n                                                                    Page No.# 9/37\n\nrespondents have raised the following issues at the time of argument:\n\n(i)       That the interceptions were done illegally within 05.04.2018\n       to 09.04.2018.\n\n(ii)      There is no question of public safety or public emergency to\n       intercept the telephonic conversation as required under\n       <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 5 (2)</a> of the Indian Telegraph Act.\n\n\n15.    It is submitted by the learned counsels representing the respondents\nthat the telephonic conversations of the accused persons, which have been\nintercepted, do not fall within the ambit of the criteria of public emergency\nand/or the interest of the public safety as laid down by the Hon&#x27;ble Apex\nCourt. In this context, they relied on a decision of Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court passed\nin the case of Peoples Union for Civil Liberty Vs. Union of India &amp; Ors.\n[(1997) 1 SCC 301], wherein it has been held that no interception of\nTelegraph can be done beyond the purview of the exceptions provided by\n<a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 5(2)</a> of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 and without adhering to the\nrules framed thereunder and as there were no rules framed by then Central\nGovernment and it would have taken some time by the Central Government to\nframe the rules for interception of Telegraph.\n\n\n16. It is further submitted by the learned counsels for the respondents that\nthe Central Government by its Notification dated 01.03.2007, GSR 193(E),\nframed the rules for interception of Telegraph under <a href=\"/doc/179207/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 7(2)(b)</a> of the\nIndian Telegraph Rules, 1985 as was mandated by the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court and\ntherefore, the Mandamus in the case of PUCL (supra) having run its course,\n                                                                    Page No.# 10/37\n\nthe said Rules which has been incorporated as Rule 419 A of the Indian\nTelegraph Rules, 1951 to occupy the field.\n\n17. In that context, the relied on a decision of Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court passed in\nthe case of Hukam Chand Shyam Lal Vs. UOI &amp; Ors. [(1976) 2 SCC\n1228] and basically emphasised on paragraph No. 13 of the judgment, which\nreads as under:\n\n     &quot;13. <a href=\"/doc/593470/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 5(1)</a>, if properly construed, does not confer unguided &amp;\n     unbridled power on the Central Govt./State Govt./Specially Authorised\n     Officer to take possession of any telegraph. Firstly, the occurrence of a\n     &#x27;public emergency&#x27; is the sine qua non for the exercise of power under\n     this section. As a preliminary step to the exercise of further jurisdiction\n     under this section the Govt. or the authority concerned must record its\n     satisfaction as to the existence of such an emergency. Further, the\n     existence of the emergency which is a pre-requisite for the exercise of\n     power under this section, must be a &#x27;public emergency&#x27; and not any\n     other kind of emergency. The expression &#x27;public emergency&#x27; has not\n     been defined in the statute, but contours broadly delineating its scope\n     and features are discernible from the section which has to read as a\n     whole. In sub- section (1) the phrase &#x27;occurrence of any public\n     emergency&#x27; is connected with and is immediately followed by the phrase\n     &quot;or in the interests of the public safety&#x27;&quot;. These two phrases appear to\n     take colour from each other. In the first part of sub-s. (2) these two\n     phrases again occur in association with each other, &amp; the context further\n     clarifies, with amplification, that a &#x27;public emergency&#x27; within the\n     contemplation of this section is one which raises problems concerning\n     the interest of the public safety, the sovereignty and integrity of India,\n     the security of the State, friendly relations with foreign States or public\n     order or the prevention of incitement to the commission of an offence. It\n     is in the context of these matters that appropriate authority has to form\n     an opinion with regard to the occurrence of a &#x27;public emergency&#x27; with a\n     view to taking further action under this section. Economic emergency is\n     not one of those matters expressly mentioned in the statute. Mere\n     &#x27;economic emergency&#x27; as the High Court calls it-may not necessarily\n     amount to a &#x27;public emergency&#x27; &amp; justify action under this section unless\n     it raises problems relating to the matters indicated in the section.&quot;\n                                                                       Page No.# 11/37\n\n\n\n18. The learned counsels for the respondents further stressed on <a href=\"/doc/1740460/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 5</a>\nof The Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, wherein it is provided that on the\noccurrence of public emergency, or in the interest of the public safety, the\nCentral Government or a State Government or any officers specially authorized\nin this behalf by the Central Government or a State Government may, if\nsatisfied that it is necessary or expedient to do so in the interest of the\nsovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the State, friendly relations\nwith foreign States or public order or for preventing incitement to the\ncommission of an offence, for the reasons to be recorded in writing, by order,\ndirect that any message or class of messages to or from any person or class of\npersons, or relating to any particular subject, brought for transmission by or\ntransmitted or received by any telegraph, shall not be transmitted, or shall be\nintercepted or detained, or shall be disclosed to the Government making the\norder or an officer thereof mentioned in the order. They further stressed on\nthe   point    that    as    per    <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_17\">Section    5   (2)</a>    of    the     Indian\nTelegraph Act, 1985, it permits the interception of messages in accordance\nwith the provisions of the said Section in case of occurrence of any public\nemergency or in the interest of public safety. Unless the public emergency has\noccurred or the interest of the public safety demands, the authorities have no\njurisdiction to exercise the powers under the said Section. Public emergency\nwould mean the prevailing of a sudden condition or state of affairs affecting\nthe public at large calling for immediate action. The expression &quot;public safety&quot;\nmeans the state or condition of freedom from danger or risk for the people at\nlarge. When either of these two conditions are not in existence, the Central\nGovernment or a State Government or the authorized officer cannot resort to\n                                                                    Page No.# 12/37\n\ntelephonic tapping even though there is satisfaction that it is necessary or\nexpedient so to do for interest of sovereignty and integrity of India etc. [PUCL\nVs. U.O.I., (1997) 1 SCC 301].\n\n\n19.   The learned counsel for the respondents also relied on the decision of\nHon&#x27;ble Apex Court in Vinit Kumar Vs. Central Bureau of Investigation &amp;\nOrs. [2019 SCC OnLine Bom 3155] which also speaks about the public\nsafety and emergency and paragraph No. 13 of the said judgment reads as\nunder, as emphasized:\n\n      &quot;13. In view of the aforesaid clear and emphatic pronunciation of law on\n      the subject by the Nine Judge Constitution Bench in K. S.\n      Puttaswami (supra), it is no longer res-integra that :-\n            (a) The right to privacy is recognized by the Nine Judge Bench as\n      inherent fundamental right having protection as an intrinsic part of the\n      right to life and personal liberty under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_18\">Article 21</a> and as a part of the\n      freedom guaranteed by Part III of the Constitution which is subject to\n      specified restrictions;\n            (b) Any infringement of the right to privacy by State Authorities\n      will have to meet the following four tests based on the &quot;Principle of\n      proportionality and legitimacy&quot; :\n           1. The action must be sanctioned by law;\n             2. The proposed action must be necessary in a democratic society\n      for a legitimate aim;\n           3. The extent of such interference must be proportionate to the\n             need for such interference;\n            4. There must be procedural guarantees against abuse of such\n      interference.\n            (c) All earlier judgments suggesting to the contrary, are no longer\n      binding precedents. The matters of infraction of the fundamental right to\n      privacy would now have to necessarily satisfy the aforesaid tests, and\n      cannot be dealt with on the basis of the overruled judgments\n                                                                       Page No.# 13/37\n\n        in M.P.Sharma (supra) or Kharak Singh (supra) or based thereon or on\n        the same line of reasoning like R. M. Malkani (supra).&quot;\n20.     It is further submitted by the learned counsels appearing for the\nrespondents that the telephonic conversation is an important facet of a man&#x27;s\nprivate life. Right to privacy would certainly include telephone conversation in\nthe privacy of one&#x27;s home or office. Thus, the telephone tapping will infringe\nthe right of a person under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_19\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India unless it is\npermitted under the procedure and established law.\n\n\n21. They further emphasized on paragraph No. 18 of the of the decision of\nHon&#x27;ble Apex Court in the case of PUCL (supra) which reads as under:\n\n\n        &quot;18. The right of privacy - by itself - has not been identified under the\n        Constitution. As a concept it may be too broad and moralistic to define it\n        judicially. Whether right to privacy can be claimed or has been infringed\n        in a given case would depend on the facts of the said case. But the right\n        to hold a telephone conversation in the privacy of one&#x27;s home or office\n        without interference can certainly be claimed as &quot;right to privacy&quot;.\n        Conversations on the telephone are often of an intimate and confidential\n        character. Telephone conversation is a part of modern man&#x27;s life. It is\n        considered so important that more and more people are carrying mobile\n        telephone instruments in their pockets. Telephone conversation is an\n        important facet of a man&#x27;s private life. Right to privacy would certainly\n        include telephone conversation in the privacy of one&#x27;s home or office.\n        Telephone-tapping would, thus, infract <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_20\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of\n        India unless it is permitted under the procedure established by law.&quot;\n\n\n(iii)     Order of interception of message was not there while passing\n         the order by the learned Special Judge and subsequently the\n         orders were passed by the Director of Home Ministry.\n                                                                     Page No.# 14/37\n\n22.   The learned counsels representing the respondents submitted that the\nlearned Special Judge, CBI had rightly dismissed the petition of the present\npetitioner/CBI as they failed to place any materials on record before the\nlearned Court below to satisfy that the intercepted telephonic conversation\nhave been intercepted in accordance with procedure established by law. By\nfiling the subsequent affidavit, the petitioner side brought on record certain\norders allegedly passed by the competent authority under Rule 419 (A) of the\nTelegraph Rules, 1951 to argue that the telephonic conversation was tapped\nas per law. However, it is submitted that the approval in case of respondent\nNo. 1 was given only on 13.04.2018, though he was taken into custody of CBI\non 12.04.2018 itself and was in custody of CBI during the period of\ninterception by CBI. The permission of Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs,\nGovernment of India, as claimed by the CBI to have been obtained, was never\nput before the Review Committee and was never approved by the Review\nCommittee and in absence of the same, the CBI could not have taken up the\ninterception of Telegraph of respondent No. 1. The learned Special Judge, CBI\nhas correctly considered the issue of admissibility of illegally intercepted\nTelegraph in evidence to reject the contention of CBI that it should be\npermitted by the learned Trial Court to lead the illegally intercepted Telegraph\nin evidence.\n\n\n23.   The learned counsels for the respondents further submitted that in a\ncriminal trial, the admissibility of intercepted Telegraph as evidence, there are\nspecific rules as being the procedural safeguards which must mandatorily be\ncomplied with (Rule 419 A of Indian Telegraph Rules, 1951) and without which\nthe intercepted Telegraph if done illegally and unlawfully cannot be allowed to\n                                                                        Page No.# 15/37\n\nbe admissible as evidence being hit by the ratio of the Nine Judge Constitution\nBench judgment in case of K.S. Puttaswami &amp; Anr. Vs. Union of India &amp;\nOrs. [(2017) 10 SCC 1], which is squarely applicable and will override the\nlaw as laid in Pooranmal case and the fundamental rights of the respondents\ncannot be infringed otherwise than due process of law.\n\n\n24.   The learned counsels appearing on behalf of respondent Nos. 5 &amp; 6\nfurther submitted that surprisingly the petitioner/CBI has arrayed the\nrespondent No. 5- Shri Suresh Kr. Agarwalla and respondent No. 6- Shri\nPranjal Sharma, as necessary parties in the instant criminal petition in absence\nof transcript of conversation of alleged accused No. 5 &amp; 6, recorded during\ninvestigation. Admittedly, when the CBI has not taped/recorded any telephonic\nconversation/transcripts of respondent Nos. 5 &amp; 6, irrespective of the fact\neither &#x27;legally&#x27; or &#x27;illegally&#x27; as such taking of voice sample for identification of\nvoice through the use of spectrographic method does not arise at all. The\nVoice Sample is a method through which recording of voice is taken from the\naccused for the purpose of comparing the other recorded speech or\nconversation obtained during investigation, as such, in absence of transcript of\nconversation, taking of Voice Sample is only a futile exercise and harassment\nto the accused persons, not to speak about the abuse of process of law. The\nrespondent Nos. 5 &amp; 6 are unnecessarily being dragged in this criminal\npetition. Therefore, the instant criminal petition is not maintainable against\nrespondent Nos. 5 &amp; 6.\n\n\n25. Further it is submitted by the learned counsels for the respondents that\nthe law as it is by Rule 419 A of the Indian Telegraph Rules, 1951 mandates\n                                                                      Page No.# 16/37\n\nthat the intercepted material (during the first 7 days) are to be mandatorily\ndestroyed by intercepting agency if permission to intercept the Telegraph as\ngranted under sub-rule 2 of Rule 419 A of the Indian Telegraph Rules, 1951 by\nthe Secretary concerned is not approved by the Standing Review Committee\nunder sub-rules 16 &amp; 17 of rule 419 A of the Indian Telegraph Rules, 1951. It\nis the case of the CBI that the permission for interception of Telegraph as was\ngranted by the Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs, Govt. of India was not\napproved by the Review Committee, and thus the said intercepted material\nstood mandatorily destroyed and is presumed not to be in existence, and\ntherefore, something that is not in existence cannot be led in evidence, or be\nproved before the learned Trial Court by the CBI. In this context, they relied\non a decision of Hon&#x27;ble Delhi High Court in case of Jatinder Pal Singh Vs.\nCBI (Crl. M.C. No. 3118/2012, dated 17.01.2022) has held that illegally\nintercepted Telegraph would not be admissible as evidence, and would have to\nbe mandatorily destroyed.\n\n\n26. Further it is submitted that while passing the order dated 28.02.2020 by\nthe learned Special Judge there was no orders of interception of the telephonic\nconversation of the phone numbers of the accused respondents in the Case\nDiary at the time of passing the order by the learned Special Judge. More so,\nin the interception order, there is no format and content of all the orders which\nare same irrespective of whether it was passed by the Director, CBI or Union\nHome Secretary except phone numbers and date. None of the orders bears\nthe official seal or signatures nor those were passed in any official letter pads.\nNone of the orders have been issued in the name of any particular person. All\nthe interception orders are general orders not addressed to any particular\n                                                                        Page No.# 17/37\n\nperson.\n\n\n27. Further it is submitted that Sub-rule (8) of the Rule 419-A of the Rules\nobligates the Central Government or State Government, as the case may be,\nto constitute a Review Committee. According to Sub-rule (9) of Rule 419-A of\nthe Rules, the Review Committee, within a period of sixty days from the issue\nof directions, shall suo moto make necessary enquiries and investigations and\nrecord its findings as to whether the directions issued under sub-rule (1) are in\naccordance with the provisions of sub-section (2) of the <a href=\"/doc/1740460/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 5</a> of the Act.\nIf the Review Committee is of the opinion that the directions are not in\naccordance with the provisions referred to above, it may set aside the\ndirections and order for destruction of the copies of the intercepted message\nor class of messages.\n\n\n28. The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent Nos. 3 &amp; 4\nalso relied on the decision of Hon&#x27;ble Rajasthan High Court, which was\nreported in 2023 SCC OnLine Raj 1108 (Shashikant Joshi Vs. State of\nRajasthan &amp; Ors.), wherein also, the judgment of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme\nCourt in the case PUCL (supra) was relied upon and in paragraph No. 13 of\nthe said judgment, it is held that in pursuance of certain directions in PUCL\n(supra) rules were suitably amended to provide for procedural safeguards for\nprotection of the right to privacy. Accordingly, Rule 419A was enacted by\nTelegraph Amendment Rules, 2007 in the Indian Telegraph rules, 1951 and if\nthe authorities failed to record any reason in writing for the requirement of\ntapping of the conversation under sub-section (2) of <a href=\"/doc/1740460/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 5</a>, such orders\nsuffers from arbitrariness and violates the constitutional right of the petitioner.\n                                                                        Page No.# 18/37\n\n\n\n29.   Reliance is also placed in the case of Kranti Associates Private\nLimited &amp; Anr. Vs. Masood Ahmed Khan &amp; Ors. [(2010) 9 SCC 496],\nwherein it has been observed by the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court that the principle\nof natural justice by judicial, quasi-judicial and even by administrative bodies\nmust record reasons in support of its conclusions. Paragraph No. 47 of the said\njudgment reads as under:\n\n      &quot;47. Summarizing the above discussion, this Court holds:\n            (a) In India the judicial trend has always been to record reasons,\n      even in administrative decisions, if such decisions affect anyone\n      prejudicially.\n            (b) A quasi-judicial authority must record reasons in support of its\n      conclusions.\n            (c) Insistence on recording of reasons is meant to serve the wider\n      principle of justice that justice must not only be done it must also\n      appear to be done as well.\n            (d) Recording of reasons also operates as a valid restraint on any\n      possible arbitrary exercise of judicial and quasi-judicial or even\n      administrative power.\n            (e) Reasons reassure that discretion has been exercised by the\n      decision maker on relevant grounds and by disregarding extraneous\n      considerations.\n             (f) Reasons have virtually become as indispensable a component\n      of a decision making process as observing principles of natural justice by\n      judicial, quasi-judicial and even by administrative bodies.\n           (g) Reasons facilitate the process of judicial review by superior\n      Courts.\n           (h) The ongoing judicial trend in all countries committed to rule of\n      law and constitutional governance is in favour of reasoned decisions\n      based on relevant facts. This is virtually the life blood of judicial decision\n      making justifying the principle that reason is the soul of justice.\n            (i) Judicial or even quasi-judicial opinions these days can be as\n                                                                      Page No.# 19/37\n\n     different as the judges and authorities who deliver them. All these\n     decisions serve one common purpose which is to demonstrate by reason\n     that the relevant factors have been objectively considered. This is\n     important for sustaining the litigants&#x27; faith in the justice delivery system.\n          (j) Insistence on reason is a requirement for both judicial\n     accountability and transparency.\n           (k) If a Judge or a quasi-judicial authority is not candid enough\n     about his/her decision making process then it is impossible to know\n     whether the person deciding is faithful to the doctrine of precedent or to\n     principles of incrementalism.\n           (l) Reasons in support of decisions must be cogent, clear and\n     succinct. A pretence of reasons or `rubber-stamp reasons&#x27; is not to be\n     equated with a valid decision making process.\n           (m) It cannot be doubted that transparency is the sine qua non of\n     restraint on abuse of judicial powers. Transparency in decision making\n     not only makes the judges and decision makers less prone to errors but\n     also makes them subject to broader scrutiny. (See David Shapiro in\n     Defence of Judicial Candor (1987) 100 Harward Law Review 731-737).\n           (n) Since the requirement to record reasons emanates from the\n     broad doctrine of fairness in decision making, the said requirement is\n     now virtually a component of human rights and was considered part of\n     Strasbourg Jurisprudence. See (1994) 19 EHRR 553, at 562 para 29 and\n     Anya vs. University of Oxford, 2001 EWCA Civ 405, wherein the Court\n     referred to <a href=\"/doc/19636/\" id=\"a_23\">Article 6</a> of European Convention of Human Rights which\n     requires,\n           &quot;adequate and intelligent reasons must be given for judicial\n     decisions&quot;.\n           (o) In all common law jurisdictions judgments play a vital role in\n     setting up precedents for the future. Therefore, for development of law,\n     requirement of giving reasons for the decision is of the essence and is\n     virtually a part of &quot;due process&quot;.&quot;\n\n\n30. Regarding the issue of maintainability, it is submitted by Mr. Srivastava,\nlearned counsel for the respondent No. 1, that it is a second revision petition\n                                                                         Page No.# 20/37\n\nby the CBI for the same cause of action between the same parties as CBI had\nearlier on 01.06.2018 moved a revision petition, being Crl. Rev. Petn. No.\n195/2018, against the order dated 19.04.2018, passed by the learned Special\nJudge, CBI, Guwahati whereby the prayer for taking Voice Sample of the\nrespondents was rejected. During the pendency of the said criminal revision\npetition before this Court, the CBI again filed another application before the\nlearned Special Judge, CBI on 15.10.2019, being Application No. 993/2019,\nwherein some relief was sought for by the CBI and the earlier revision petition\nwas withdrawn which was accordingly disposed of on withdrawal vide order\ndated 07.11.2019, passed by this Court. More so, the earlier Crl. Rev. Petn. No.\n195/2018 was withdrawn with a declaration that the CBI is not going to\npursue the matter anymore and accordingly, the said revision petition was\ndisposed of on withdrawal. It is further submitted by Mr. Srivastava that once\nthe criminal revision petition was dismissed by this Court, even on withdrawal,\nthe jurisdiction of this Court, which is only a statutory jurisdiction, cannot be\ninvoked again when the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court has held that even extra-ordinary\nwrit jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_24\">Article 226</a> <a href=\"/doc/1331149/\" id=\"a_25\">&amp; 227</a> of the Constitution cannot be invoked\nif an earlier lis among the same parties and on the same cause of action was\ndismissed by the Court without the leave to reagitate the issues. In this\nregard, reliance is placed on Sarguja Transport Service Vs. State\nTransport Appellate Tribunal, M.P., Gwalior, AIR 1987 SC 88.\n\n\n31.    Mr. Srivastava further submitted that the object of the revisional\njurisdictional is to set right &quot;a patent defect&quot; or &quot;an error of jurisdiction or law&quot;\nor &quot;the perversity&quot; which crept in during the proceedings and it was thus\nincumbent upon the CBI to state as to what was the patent defect in the\n                                                                       Page No.# 21/37\n\nimpugned order or what was the error of jurisdiction or what was the\nperversity in the order passed by the learned Special Judge, CBI.\n\n\n32.   Relying on the decision of Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court passed in Ritesh\nSinha (supra), it is submitted by Mr. Srivastava that there was no law to\nrequire accused to provide Voice Sample and if the accused did not want to\ngive Voice Sample, he or she cannot be forced by the learned Magistrate to\nprovide the same and to fill the legislative gap, the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court abled\nthe Magistrate to direct the accused to provide the Voice Sample if so satisfied\nand thus the judgment dealt with only the jurisdiction to direct to provide\nVoice Sample and not the merits of the case as to whether the Magistrate can\nexercise the jurisdiction or not.\n\n\n33. Learned counsels for the respondents further relied on a decision of this\nCourt passed in the case of Pallab Das Vs. Central Bureau of\nInvestigation &amp; Ors. (Crl. Rev. Pet. No. 386 of 2009), decided on\n10.08.2012), and emphasized on paragraph Nos. 50, 51 &amp; 57 of the\njudgment, wherein it has been held that judicial intervention in exercise of\nrevisional jurisdiction is founded on the doctrine of ex debito justitae to correct\na manifest illegality and error of procedure resulting in gross and flagrant\nmiscarriage of justice. The jurisdiction, as the precedential enjoinment\nmandate, is not exercisable to correct a view of a subordinate court based on\na   perceived   erroneous    appreciation   of   evidence   suggesting    different\ndeductions.\n\n\n34. The learned counsels for the respondents also relied on a decision of\n                                                                    Page No.# 22/37\n\nHon&#x27;ble Supreme Court passed in the case of Kishan Rao Vs.\nShankargouda (Criminal Appeal No. 803 of 2018), decided on\n02.07.2018.\n\n\n35. Per contra, it is submitted by Mr. Haloi, learned Special Public Prosecutor,\nCBI that while passing the order by the authority concerned, there is no need\nof elaborate discussion of the reasons while making the order. Rather such an\nelaborate discussion may affect the privacy of the party. In that context, he\nalso cited a decision of the Hon&#x27;ble Delhi High Court passed in W.P.(CRL) No.\n1147/2020 (Santosh Kumar Vs. Union of India &amp; Anr.) and basically\nrelied on paragraph No. 44 of the said judgment, which reads as under:\n\n      &quot;44. The disclosure of elaborate reasons for interception orders would\n      be against the modified disclosure requirements of procedural fairness\n      which have been universally deemed acceptable for the protection of\n      other facets of public including the source of information leading to the\n      detection of crime or other wrong doing, sensitive intelligence\n      information and other information supplied in confidence for the purpose\n      of government or discharge of certain public functions. Furthermore, the\n      Rule 419 A of the Telegraph Rules provide for extreme secrecy, utmost\n      care and precaution in the matter of interception as it affects privacy.&quot;\n36.    Mr. Haloi further submitted that in the present petition, the matters\npertain to corruption which is dangerous for public safety since economic\ncrimes ultimately affect the economic safety of the entire country and it is\ncitizen.\n\n\n37. Mr. Haloi further relied on another decision of Madras High Court passed\nin W.P. Nos. 5466, 5470 of 2020, W.M.P. Nos. 6391, 6394, 6396 and\n6397 of 2020 (Sanjay Bhandari &amp; Ors. Vs. The Secretary of\n                                                                      Page No.# 23/37\n\nGovernment. of India &amp; Ors.), dated 23.11.2020, and emphasized on\nparagraph No. 14 of the judgment, which reads as under:\n\n\n        &quot;14. That apart, in view of the above discussion the first respondent\n        passed the orders for detection, prevention, investigation and\n        prosecution of corrupt activities of the petitioners herein in accordance\n        with the provision under <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 5(2)</a> of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885.\n        Thereafter, the Court finds no violation of <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 5(2)</a> of the Telegraph\n        Act and also it would not amount to violation of the right to privacy\n        under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_28\">Article 21</a> and freedom of speech and expression guaranteed\n        under <a href=\"/doc/1142233/\" id=\"a_29\">Article 19(1)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_30\">19(2)</a> of the Constitution of India. Therefore,\n        these writ petitions are devoid of merits.&quot;\n\n\n38. Mr. Haloi, learned Standing Counsel, CBI also relied on another decision\nof the Hon&#x27;ble Delhi High Court passed in Crl. M. C. No. 1534/2018, dated\n07.12.2023 (Sanjiv Kumar Vs. The State of Govt. of NCT of Delhi) and\naccordingly submitted that in the instant case, the prosecution has complied\nwith the provision of <a href=\"/doc/357830/\" id=\"a_31\">Telegraph Act</a> and obtained necessary authorization to\nintercept the phone of the respondents and therefore, the judgment of PUCL\n(supra) and Jatinder Pal Singh (supra) will not be applicable in the present\ncase.\n\n\n39.     Accordingly, Mr. Haloi submitted that while dismissing the petition, the\nlearned Special Judge overlooked the provision of <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 5(2)</a> of the Indian\nTelegraph Act and Rule 419A of the Indian Telegraph Rules, amended in the\nyear 2007, which authorized the law and the enforcement agencies to seek for\nlegal interception of the telephonic conversations in connection with the\noffence of serious nature and here in the instant case also, out of 13 numbers\nof letter of permission for interception, 8 numbers of permissions were granted\n                                                                     Page No.# 24/37\n\nby the Home Secretary to the Government of India and 5 numbers of\npermissions issued by the Director, CBI after duly examining the request and\nconsidering the fact that the interceptions were sought in the interest of public\norder and safety and to prevent incitement to the commission of an offence.\nHence, Mr. Haloi submitted that in such nature of cases, the voice sample is\nvery vital evidence to prove the case and in such type of cases, other\ncorroborative evidence are rare and therefore, the order passed by the learned\nSpecial Judge, CBI is liable to be set aside and quashed.\n\n\n40. In this context, the learned counsels for the respondents submitted that\nthe cases relied by the CBI are general cases related to <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_33\">P.C. Act</a> and not\nrelated to phone tapping under the <a href=\"/doc/357830/\" id=\"a_34\">Indian Telegraph Act</a> except Sanjay\nBhandari&#x27;s case and therefore these cases are not relevant in the present\ncase. Further it is submitted that the case of Ritesh Sinha (supra) is not\napplicable in this case and facts of the case of Ritesh Sinha (supra) is totally\ndifferent from the present fact of the case.\n\n\n41.   I have considered the rival submissions put forwarded by the learned\ncounsels appearing on behalf of the parties and also perused the materials\navailable on record.\n\n\n42. It is the case of the petitioner/CBI that after the dismissal of the prayer\nfor recording of the voice samples of the present respondents by the learned\nSpecial Judge on 28.02.2020, one revision petition was filed before this Court,\nbut subsequently the same was withdrawn on 07.11.2019 and another\napplication was preferred before the learned Special Judge, CBI for permission\n                                                                    Page No.# 25/37\n\nto obtain voice samples of the accused persons. But the learned Special Judge,\nCBI overlooked the provision of <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 5(2)</a> of the Indian Telegraph Act read\nwith Section 419A of the Indian Telegraph Rules (amended in 2007) which\nauthorizes the law enforcement agency to seek for legal interception of\ntelephonic conversation in connection with the offences of serious in nature. It\nis further the case of the petitioner/CBI that the Indian Telegraph Amendment\nRules provide that all the request for such interception would only be\nconsidered after due examination/ screening by the Review Committee as\nsetup under the provision of the said Rules, headed by the Cabinet Secretary,\nGovernment of India, considering of Secretary to Government of India,\nDepartment of Telecommunications. But, without considering the fact, the\nlearned Special Judge arbitrarily rejected the prayer for recording of the voice\nsamples of the present petitioners.\n\n\n43.   On the other hand, it is the case of the respondents that the entire\ninterceptions were done illegally within 05.04.2018 to 09.04.2018. Further it is\nthe case of the respondent that there is no question of public safety or public\nemergency to intercept the telephonic conversation as required under <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_36\">Section\n5(2)</a> of the Indian Telegraph Act. As per the respondents, the telephonic\nconversation of the accused persons, which have been intercepted, do not fall\nwithin the ambit of criteria of public emergency and/or the interest of the\npublic safety as laid down by the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court in the case of PUCL\n(supra). The judgment of the Apex Court in PUCL (supra) was mainly stressed\nby the learned counsels for the respondents, wherein it has been held that no\ninterception of the telegraph can be done beyond the purview of the\nexceptions provided by <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 5(2)</a> of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 and\n                                                                        Page No.# 26/37\n\nwithout adhering to the rules framed thereunder and as there were no rules\nframed by then Central Government, it would have taken some time by the\nCentral Government to frame the rules for interception of Telegraph.\n\n\n44.    For ready reference, <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 5(2)</a> of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 is\nextracted hereinbelow:\n\n      &quot;5. Power for Government to take possession of licensed telegraphs and\n      to order interception of messages.\n      ...\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_1\">      (2) On the occurrence of any public emergency, or in the interest of the\n      public safety, the Central Government or a State Government or any\n      officer specially authorized in this behalf by the Central Government or a\n      State Government may, if satisfied that it is necessary or expedient so to\n      do in the interests of the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of\n      the State, friendly relations with foreign States or public order or for\n      preventing incitement to the commission of an offence, for reasons to be\n      recorded in writing, by order, direct that any message or class of\n      messages to or from any person or class of persons, or relating to any\n      particular subject, brought for transmission by or transmitted or received\n      by any telegraph, shall not be transmitted, or shall be intercepted or\n      detained, or shall be disclosed to the Government making the order or an\n      officer thereof mentioned in the order:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">            Provided that press messages intended to be published in India of\n      correspondents accredited to the Central Government or a State\n      Government shall not be intercepted or detained, unless their transmission\n      has been prohibited under this sub-section.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">45.     In connection with the applicability of <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 5(2)</a> of the Indian\nTelegraph Act, the learned counsels for the respondents also relied on various\ndecisions, as referred above, wherein it is provided that unless public\nemergency has occurred or the interest of the public safety demands, the\nauthorities have no jurisdiction to exercise power under the said Section.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_2\">                                                                      Page No.# 27/37\n\nPublic emergency would mean the prevailing of a sudden condition or state of\naffairs affecting the public at large calling for immediate action. The expression\n&quot;public safety&quot; means the state or condition of freedom from danger or risk for\nthe people at large.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_3\">46. Further it is the case of the respondents that the telephonic conversation\nis an important facet of a man&#x27;s private life. Right to privacy would certainly\ninclude telephone conversation in the privacy of one&#x27;s home or office. Thus,\nthe telephone tapping will infringe the right of a person under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_40\">Article 21</a> of the\nConstitution of India unless it is permitted under the procedure and\nestablished law. But, here in the instant case, the order of interception of the\nmessages was not there while passing the order by the learned Special Judge\nand subsequently the orders were passed by the Director of Home Ministry.\nThus, it is submitted by the respondents side that the petitioner/CBI failed to\nplace any material on record before the learned Court below to satisfy that the\nintercepted telephonic conversation have been intercepted in accordance with\nprocedure established by law. More so, it is the claim of the respondents that\nin the interception order, there is no format and content of all the orders which\nare same irrespective of whether it was passed by the Director, CBI or Union\nHome Secretary except phone numbers and date. Further, none of the orders\nbears the official seal or signatures nor those were passed in any official letter\npads. None of the orders have been issued in the name of any particular\nperson. All the interception orders are general orders not addressed to any\nparticular person. Thus, the orders for interceptions which were produced by\nthe CBI are not the order which were illegally passed in accordance with the\nestablished law. More so, those were not placed before the Review Committee\n                                                                     Page No.# 28/37\n\nas required under Rule 419A of the Indian Telegraph Rules, 1951 which\nobligates the Central Government or the State Government as the case may be\nto constitute a Review Committee.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_4\">47.   The amended provision of Rule 419A of the Indian Telegraph Rules\nprovides as under:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">      &quot;419-A. (1) Directions for interception of any message or class of\n      messages under sub-section (2) of <a href=\"/doc/1740460/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 5</a> of the Indian Telegraph\n      Act, 1885 (hereinafter referred to as the said (Act) shall not be issued\n      except by an order made by the Secretary to the Government of India in\n      the Ministry of Home Affairs in the case of Government of India and by\n      the Secretary to the State Government in-charge of the Home\n      Department in the case of a State Government. In unavoidable\n      circumstances, such order may be made by an officer, not below the\n      rank of a Joint Secretary to the Government of India, who has been duly\n      authorized by the Union Home Secretary or the State Home Secretary,\n      as the case may be:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">      Provided that in emergent cases--\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">      (i) in remote areas, where obtaining of prior directions for interception\n      of messages or class of messages is not feasible; or\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">      (ii) for operational reasons, where obtaining of prior directions for\n      interception of message or class of messages is not feasible;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_5\">      the required interception of any message or class of messages shall be\n      carried out with the prior approval of the Head or the second senior\n      most officer of the authorized security i.e. Law Enforcement Agency at\n      the Central Level and the officers authorised in this behalf, not below the\n      rank of Inspector General of Police at the state level but the concerned\n      competent authority shall be informed of such interceptions by the\n      approving authority within three working days and that such\n                                                                     Page No.# 29/37\n\n      interceptions shall be got confirmed by the concerned competent\n      authority within a period of seven working days.

Further, Rule 419 (17) (18) provides as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">      &quot;419. (17) The Review Committee shall meet at least once in two\n      months and record its findings whether the directions issued under sub-\n      rule (1) are in accordance with the provisions of sub-section (2) of\n      <a href=\"/doc/1740460/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 5</a> of the said Act.

Here in the instant case, it is seen that the order of interception was\npassed by the competent authority, i.e. the Director of CBI or Union Home\nSecretary, along with telephone numbers. As per Rule 419A of the Indian\nTelegraph Rules (Amended Rules), it authorizes the law enforcement agency\nto seek for legal interception of telephone conversation in connection with the\noffence of serious in nature. Further, as per the amended Rules, all the request\nfor   such    interceptions    would    only    be    considered     after   due\nexamination/screening by the Reviewing Committee as set up under the\nprovision of said rules, headed by the Cabinet Secretary, Government of India,\n                                                                     Page No.# 30/37\n\nconsidering   of   Secretary   to   Government     of   India,   Department    of\nTelecommunications. Here in the instant case, it is seen that the order of\ninterception, which were produced by the CBI, were passed by the Indian\nHome Secretary to the Government of India and the Director, CBI after due\nexamination of the request for interceptions of the conversations of the\npresent respondents considering the nature of the offence.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_8\">50. However, it is submitted by the learned counsels for the respondents that\nthe orders were not placed before the learned Special Judge at the time of\npassing the impugned order whereby the prayer for recording of voice sample\nwas rejected by the learned Special Judge. But, from the charge-sheet of the\ncase, it is seen that the order of interception of the telephonic conversation is\nvery much mentioned in the charge-sheet with the telephone numbers and the\ndate of their interception by the CBI. It was the duty of the Special Judge to\nconsider those materials in the Case Diary or the documents submitted and if\nthe same were not there asked the CBI to produce the same and if they failed\nto produce, it would have been reflected in the impugned order.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_9\">51.   Coming to the issue raised by the learned counsel for the respondents\nwith regard to &quot;public safety&quot; and &quot;public emergency&quot; which is mandatorily\nrequired for interception of any telegraph or telephonic conversation as\nprovided under <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_43\">Section 5(2)</a> of the Indian Telegraph Act, it is the case of the\nrespondents side that in the present case there is no any such public\nemergency or public safety for interception of telephonic conversations of the\nrespondent and there is no material to show that any public emergency or\npublic safety arises for which it was necessary for interception of the\n                                                                   Page No.# 31/37\n\ntelephonic messages. But, the present case is a case of corruption and the\nsame are the economic and organized crimes and the conspiracy are hatched\nin most secretive manners. The impact of corruption on public safety cannot\nbe gainsaid in the present times and considering this aspect of the case, the\nscreening/review committee had passed the order for intercepting the\ntelephonic messages of the present respondents after satisfying all the\nmaterials placed before the committee.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"58898221\" id=\"span_1\">52. In the case as relied by the CBI/petitioner in W.P. Nos. 5466, 5470 of\n2020, W.M.P. Nos. 6391, 6394, 6396 and 6397 of 2020 (<a href=\"/doc/58898221/\" id=\"a_44\">Sanjay\nBhandari &amp; Ors. Vs.

That apart, in view of the above discussion the first respondent\n     passed the orders for detection, prevention, investigation and\n     prosecution of corrupt activities of the petitioners herein in accordance\n     with the provision under <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_45\">Section 5(2)</a> of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885.\n     Therefore, this Court finds no violation of <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_46\">Section 5(2)</a> of the Telegraph\n     Act and also it would not amount to violation of the right to privacy\n     under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_47\">Article 21</a> and freedom of speech and expression guaranteed\n     under <a href=\"/doc/1142233/\" id=\"a_48\">Article 19(1)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_49\">19(2)</a> of the Constitution of India. Therefore,\n     these writ petitions are devoid of merits.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_11\">53. Though the present case is not directly involved with the public safety or\npublic emergency, but the nature of the case directly affects the economy of\nthe society wherein the public money is involved. And, as per the Charge-\nSheet, during investigation there was a recovery of Rs. 40 Lakhs from the\naccused- Ramesh Goenka. The plea of prejudice by the respondents will not\n                                                                       Page No.# 32/37\n\nsustain if they were asked to give voice sample and it would be open for the\nrespondents to take all objections with regard to legality of the interceptions at\nthe stage of trial. Furthermore, from the discussions made above, it is seen\nthat the interception orders were passed by the competent authority for\nintercepting the messages/telephonic conversations of the respondents and\nfrom the nature of the case, it is also seen that it is the only evidence for the\npetitioner/CBI to substantiate their claim as all the conversations were made\nover telephone amongst the respondents. Further it is seen that all the\ninterceptions have been done in accordance with law as provided under the\n<a href=\"/doc/357830/\" id=\"a_50\">Telegraph Act</a>. It is also seen that all the interceptions orders were passed by\nthe competent authority who were also the members of the review committee\nand hence, it cannot be held that there was no compliance of <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_51\">Section 5(2)</a> of\nthe Indian Telegraph Act.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\">54.   The Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court in the case of Ritesh Sinha (supra) has held\nthat the fundamental right to privacy is subject to public interest and therefore\nnot absolute. Accordingly, in exercise of his jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/500307/\" id=\"a_52\">Article 142</a> of the\nConstitution of India, the Supreme Court held that till exclusive provision are\nmade in the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_53\">Cr.P.C</a>. by the Parliament, the Magistrate would have the power to\norder the person to give his voice sample for the purpose of investigation of a\ncrime.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_13\">55.      It is the admitted position that as per <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_54\">Section 5(2)</a> of the Indian\nTelegraph Act, an order of interception can be issued either in case of &quot;public\nemergency&quot; or for the interest of the &quot;public safety&quot; as per law laid down by\nthe Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in case of PUCL (supra). But, considering the\n                                                                           Page No.# 33/37\n\npeculiar circumstances and the nature of the case, the interceptions can also\nbe allowed in such a nature of case, though it is not directly associated with\nthe public emergency or the public safety. But, as discussed above, the money\nwhich is involved and subject matter of this case is the public money and\nwhich otherwise will affect the entire society at large. Further, in any event, it\nwill be open for the respondents to raise objection with regard to non-\ncompliance    of   statutory   proviso   for   interceptions   of   the     telephonic\ncalls/telephonic messages at an appropriate stage or at the time of trial.\nAllowing the prayer for recording of voice sample cannot be held to be non\njustifiable, rather not allowing will cause prejudice to the prosecution as the\nvoice sample or intercepted messages are the primary evidence for the CBI to\nsubstantiate their plea. The respondents may challenge the legality or\nevidentiary value of the intercepted message at the appropriate stage of trial if\nsuch justified reasons appears to them from the evidence which may come in\ntheir favour at that time.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_14\">56. Coming to the interceptions of messages for the respondent Nos. 5 &amp; 6,\nit is submitted by their learned engaged counsel that the respondent Nos. 5 &amp;\n6 cannot be roped in the instant case for the absence of transcript of\nconversation of alleged accused No. 5 &amp; 6, recorded during investigation. The\nadmitted position being that the CBI did not tap/record any telephonic\nconversation/ transcripts of respondent Nos. 5 &amp; 6, irrespective of the fact\neither legally or illegally, the taking of voice sample for identification of voice\nthrough the use of spectrographic method does not arise at all. As such, the\nrespondent Nos. 5 &amp; 6 are unnecessarily being dragged in this criminal petition\nand accordingly it is submitted that the instant criminal petition is not\n                                                                     Page No.# 34/37\n\nmaintainable against respondent Nos. 5 &amp; 6.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_15\">57.   Mr. Haloi, learned Special Public Prosecutor, CBI admitted the fact that\nthe earlier petition was filed praying for obtaining the voice samples mainly for\nthe accused persons, namely, Swetabh Suman, Ramesh Goenka, Pranjal\nSarmah and Pratab Das. But the culpability surfaces during investigation\nagainst the respondent Nos. 5 &amp; 6, namely, Pranjal Sarmah and Suresh Kumar\nAgarwalla, and accordingly, the application was made for recording of voice\nsample of these 2 (two) respondents. From the charge-sheet and the order of\nintercepted messages also, it is seen that the order of interception of\nmessages were passed against the respondents, namely, Ramesh Goenka,\nAmit Goenka, Swetabh Suman, Pratap Das &amp; Balraj Dayma. But there were no\nintercepted messages of the respondent Nos. 5 &amp; 6 for comparing their voice\nsamples with the intercepted messages. However, from the submissions made\nby the learned Special Public Prosecutor, CBI, it is seen that at the time of\nfiling the earlier application before the learned Special Judge, CBI the\ntranscript voice messages were not available of the respondent Nos. 5 &amp; 6 as\nduring the investigation only, their involvement in the alleged offence has\ncame out and hence, the prayer for recording of their voice sample was made\nbefore the learned Special Judge, CBI. It is an admitted fact that the\nintercepted messages of the respondent Nos. 5 &amp; 6 were not available for\ncomparing with the voice sample as prayed for by the CBI for recording of the\nvoice samples and without any transcribed voice messages, it may not be\npossible for the CBI to compare the voice sample of the respondent Nos. 5 &amp;\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_16\">6. However, in the subsequent development, if the CBI has been able to\nintercept any such voice messages or has come across any such recordings of\n                                                                         Page No.# 35/37\n\nthe respondent Nos. 5 &amp; 6, the same may be compared with the voice sample\nto be recorded of the respondent Nos. 5 &amp; 6. Hence, there cannot be any\njustified reason to reject the prayer for voice sample of respondent Nos. 5 &amp; 6\nas prayed by the CBI. However, at the stage of trial, if the CBI fails to adduce\nevidence of any such matching of voice so recorded, their exercise would fail.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_17\">58. Coming to the issue raised by the learned counsels for the respondents\nregarding the maintainability of the present petition, it is seen that the present\npetition is filed after the withdrawal of the earlier revision petition filed before\nthis Court which was numbered as Crl. Rev. P. No. 195/2018 and the same was\nwithdrawn on 07.11.2019 with a declaration that the CBI is not going to\npursue the matter anymore and on that basis, the revision petition was\ndisposed of on withdrawal. In this context, Mr. Srivastava, learned counsel for\nthe respondent No. 1, also submitted that even if the revision petition was\ndismissed on withdrawal, the jurisdiction of this Court cannot be invoked again\nand it has been held by the Hon&#x27;ble Apex court that even extra-ordinary writ\njurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_55\">Articles 226</a> <a href=\"/doc/1331149/\" id=\"a_56\">&amp; 227</a> of the Constitution cannot be invoked if\nan earlier lis among the same parties and on the same cause of action was\ndismissed by the Court without the leave to reagitate the issues. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1994144\" id=\"span_2\">In this\nregard, reliance is placed on <a href=\"/doc/1994144/\" id=\"a_57\">Sarguja Transport Service Vs. State\nTransport Appellate Tribunal, M.P., Gwalior</a>, AIR 1987 SC 88. Further,\nit is submitted by Mr. Srivastava, learned counsel for the respondent No. 1,\nthat the object of the revisional jurisdictional is to set right &quot;a patent defect&quot; or\n&quot;an error of jurisdiction or law&quot; or &quot;the perversity&quot; which crept in during the\nproceedings and it was thus incumbent upon the CBI to state as to what was\nthe patent defect in the impugned order or what was the error of jurisdiction\n                                                                         Page No.# 36/37\n\nor what was the perversity in the order passed by the learned Special Judge,\nCBI.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_18\">59. But, here in the instant case, it is seen that though the earlier revision\npetition was withdrawn by CBI with a declaration that the said revision petition\nwill not be pursued by the CBI, but the same was not dismissed on merit and\nit was disposed simply on withdrawal by the CBI. Thus, it cannot be out rightly\nheld that the subsequent or the present revision petition is not maintainable\nonly for the reason of withdrawal of the earlier revision petition without leave\nfor filing a fresh revision petition and only for that reason, the entire criminal\npetition cannot be dismissed on the point of maintainability on this sole\nground.
