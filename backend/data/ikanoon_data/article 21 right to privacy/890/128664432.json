The learned counsel for the appellant contended that\n\n    the charge against the accused has not been proved beyond\n\n\n\n    reasonable doubt.

It is a serious blow to her\n\n               supreme honour and offends her self-esteem and\n               dignity as well. It degrades and humiliates the victim\n\n\n               and where the victim is a helpless innocent child or\n               a minor, it leaves behind a traumatic experience.

The relevant portion of the judgement is reproduced as\n\n    under:-          r\n               &quot;31..............By now it is well settled that the\n\n               testimony of a victim in cases of sexual offences\n               is vital and unless there are compelling reasons\n               which necessitate looking for corroboration of a\n\n\n\n               statement, the courts should find no difficulty to\n               act on the testimony of the victim of a sexual\n\n\n\n\n               assault alone to convict the accused. No doubt,\n\n\n\n\n\n               her testimony has to inspire confidence. Seeking\n               corroboration to a statement before relying upon\n\n\n\n\n\n               the same as a rule, in such cases, would literally\n               amount to adding insult to injury. The deposition\n               of the prosecutrix has, thus, to be taken as a\n               whole. Needless to reiterate that the victim of rape\n               is not an accomplice and her evidence can be\n               acted upon without corroboration. She stands at a\n               higher pedestal than an injured witness does.

To insist on\n\n\n\n\n                                                              .\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_43\">               corroboration, except in the rarest of rare cases,\n               is to equate one who is a victim of the lust of\n\n\n\n\n\n               another with an accomplice to a crime and\n               thereby insult womanhood. It would be adding\n               insult to injury to tell a woman that her claim of\n\n\n\n\n\n               rape will not be believed unless it is corroborated\n               in material particulars, as in the case of an\n               accomplice to a crime. Why should the evidence\n\n               of the girl or the woman who complains of rape or\n\n               sexual molestation be viewed with the aid of\n               spectacles fitted with lenses tinged with doubt,\n\n\n               disbelief or suspicion?

We have minutely gone through the\n\n\n\n\n\n    statement of the child victim and found the same to be trustworthy\n\n    and confidence inspiring.

We have also gone through the\n\n    statement of the accused under <a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 313</a>, Cr.P.C., wherein he\n\n    stated that he had been falsely implicated in the case as he stood\n\n\n\n    surety for father of the child victim in a criminal case and when her\n\n    father jumped over the bail, he used to visit the house of the child\n\n\n\n\n    victim in search of her father, then the mother of the child victim\n\n\n\n\n\n    used to threaten him not to search her husband, otherwise she\n\n\n\n\n\n    would rope him in a false case. However, he did not lead any\n\n    evidence in his defence, despite opportunity granted to him. We\n\n    have also examined the statement of child victim as well the other\n\n    prosecution witnesses to satisfy ourselves as to whether there\n\n    was any likelihood of false implication or motive of false\n\n    accusation.

From the\n\n    perusal of the proceedings, it appears that though the father of the\n\n\n\n\n    child victim did not appear in the Court of SDM, Baijnath, but no\n\n\n\n\n\n    notice had been issued to the accused to produce the father of the\n\n\n\n\n\n    child victim, which could show that the accused was directed by\n\n    the Court of SDM, Baijnath to produce the father of the child victim\n\n    for which he had been visiting her house. There is no material on\n\n    record to show that any punitive action was taken against the\n\n    accused by the Court of SDM, Baijnath. Even if the defence of\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_50\">                                             ::: Downloaded on - 13/12/2022 20:34:50 :::CIS</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_51\">                                     22</span>\n\n\n\n\n    the accused is accepted that he had been directed by the SDM,\n\n    Baijnath to produce the father of the child victim, in which the\n\n\n\n\n                                                              .\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_54\">    accused stood surety by executing bond in the sum of Rs.5,000/-,\n\n    the same cannot be a ground to falsely implicate him as for such a\n\n\n\n\n\n    meagre amount of Rs.5,000/-, the complainant would not have\n\n    implicated the accused in a case of this nature by putting the\n\n\n\n\n\n    reputation of her daughter at stake.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_55\">    27.        The learned counsel for the appellant lastly contended\n\n    that the learned trial Court has wrongly convicted the appellant for\n\n    the offence of aggravated penetrative sexual assault defined\n\n    under <a href=\"/doc/183539218/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 6</a> of the Act as the entire statement of the child\n\n\n\n    victim, coupled with the medical evidence shows that the accused\n\n    had only touched the private part of the child victim with his\n\n\n\n\n    private part and there was no penetration of his penis into her\n\n\n\n\n\n    vagina.   This contention of the learned counsel for the appellant\n\n\n\n\n\n    deserves to be accepted as while appearing in the witness-box as\n\n    PW-3, the child victim categorically stated that the accused while\n\n    entering inside the room, had opened his trousers/pyjamas and\n\n    thereafter opened her salwar and had put his penis in her vagina,\n\n    but he was not in a position to penetrate and he had also touched\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\">                                             ::: Downloaded on - 13/12/2022 20:34:50 :::CIS</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_53\">                                     23</span>\n\n\n\n\n    her private part with his penis and in the meantime, some white\n\n    material came out of the penis of the accused.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_56\">                                                            .\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_57\">    28.         The medical evidence lends support to the aforesaid\n\n    statement of the child victim as the Medical Officer, who appeared\n\n\n\n\n\n    in the witness-box as PW-2, also deposed that when the child\n\n    victim was brought for medical examination, the child victim\n\n\n\n\n\n    disclosed to her that the accused had opened her clothes and\n\n    touched his private part with her private part and masturbated in\n\n    front of her and no penetration was done. She had also stated\n\n    that on examination, no scratches, bruises and lacerations were\n\n    found on the body of the child victim and the hymen was found\n\n\n\n    intact and she had issued MLC Ext.PW2/B. As per RFSL report\n\n    Ext. PX, blood and semen were not detected in the vaginal smear\n\n\n\n\n    slides and vaginal swabs of the child victim.         At this stage, it\n\n\n\n\n\n    would be relevant to refer to <a href=\"/doc/116095584/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 7</a> of the Act, which reads as\n\n\n\n\n\n    under:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">               &quot;7.

Since the evidence on record shows that the accused\n\n\n\n\n\n    had touched the private part of the child victim with his private\n\n\n\n\n\n    part with sexual intent and the same involved physical contact\n\n    without penetration, hence, the accused had committed sexual\n\n\n\n\n\n    assault on the child victim within the definition of sexual assault\n\n    as per <a href=\"/doc/116095584/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 7</a> of the Act .\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_60\">    30.        Now the next question, which arises for consideration,\n\n    is as to what was the age of the child victim at the time of the\n\n    occurrence. PW-2 Dr. Nandita Katoch had referred the child victim\n\n\n\n    for dental examination for her age determination. PW-16\n\n    Dr.Kalpana Mahajan, Radiologist, deposed that on 15.07.2016\n\n\n\n\n    the child victim was referred to her for ossification test and as per\n\n\n\n\n\n    test and X-Ray reports, the age of the child victim was between\n\n\n\n\n\n    8½ to 12½ years and to this effect, she had issued report\n\n    Ext.PW16/A. The mother of the child victim, while appearing on\n\n    the witness-box as PW-4, disclosed that at the relevant time, the\n\n    age of the child victim was 11 years. PW-5, the then Up-pradhan\n\n    of the Gram Panchayat, stated that as per birth entry recorded in\n\n    the register Ext.

PW-11, the then Secretary of the Gram\n\n    Panchayat, deposed that he had issued the date of birth certificate\n\n\n\n\n                                                             .\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_61\">    of the child victim Ext.

As per <a href=\"/doc/106153271/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 9(m)</a> of the Act,\n\n    whoever commits sexual assault on a child below twelve years will\n\n\n\n    come under the definition of aggravated sexual assault.
