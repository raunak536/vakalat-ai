This Court by order dated 10.04.2024 condoned the\n\ndelay in filing the related Special Leave Petition (Criminal) Diary\n\nNo. 11387 of 2024 and issued notice. On delay being condoned,\n\nthe case came to be registered as Special Leave Petition (Criminal)\n\nNo. 5260 of 2024. The matter was heard by the Vacation Bench on\n\n03.07.2024.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">5.         First Information Report (FIR) was lodged against the\n\nappellant by the informant Inspector Tej Bahadur Singh under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1949191/\" id=\"a_9\">Sections 121A</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1926477/\" id=\"a_10\">489B</a> and <a href=\"/doc/257920/\" id=\"a_11\">489C</a> of IPC. It came to be registered as\n\nCrime No. 01 of 2015. Informant stated that fake Indian currency\n\nnotes of the denomination of Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 500, totalling a\n\nsum of Rs. 26,03,500.00, were recovered from the possession of\n\nthe appellant on 22.02.2015 at about 09:10 PM from the Indo-\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">\f                                 3</span>\n\n\nNepal border. He was apprehended by a constable of the ATS team\n\nand brought to the ATS Headquarter. In the course of\n\ninvestigation, the appellant disclosed his name as Sheikh Javed\n\nIqbal @ Ashfaq Ansari @ Javed Ansari, resident of Narayani Parsa,\n\nBelwa, Nepal. In addition to the fake Indian currency notes, one\n\nNepalese driving licence of the appellant and one Nepalese\n\ncitizenship certificate also of the appellant were recovered besides\n\ntwo mobile phones. According to the police, appellant had\n\nconfessed that he was engaged in the illegal trade of supplying\n\ncounterfeit Indian currency notes in Nepal. The appellant was\n\narrested on 23.02.2015.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">6.        Appellant had moved a bail application before the\n\nAdditional Sessions Judge, Special Judge, Lucknow (‘trial court’\n\nhereinafter) but the same was rejected on 24.08.2016. It was\n\nthereafter that the related bail application was filed by the\n\nappellant before the High Court which came to be dismissed by the\n\nimpugned order.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_9\">7.        At this stage, it may be stated that chargesheet against\n\nthe appellant under <a href=\"/doc/1926477/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 489B</a> and <a href=\"/doc/257920/\" id=\"a_13\">489C</a> IPC was filed by the\n\nprosecution on 19.08.2015. Supplementary chargesheet under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/122170/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 16</a> of the UAP Act was filed on 26.08.2015. It was\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">\f                                 4</span>\n\n\nmentioned therein that the Hon’ble Governor had granted sanction\n\non 25.08.2015 to prosecute the appellant under <a href=\"/doc/1926477/\" id=\"a_15\">Sections 489B</a>\n\nand <a href=\"/doc/257920/\" id=\"a_16\">489C</a> IPC read with <a href=\"/doc/122170/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 16</a> of the UAP Act, as amended.\n\nBefore the trial court, the case came to be registered as Case No.\n\n940 of 2015.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_10\">8.        The trial court considered the chargesheet as well as the\n\ndischarge application filed by the appellant and by the common\n\norder dated 27.05.2016, the discharge application was dismissed,\n\nwhile directing that charges be framed against the appellant under\n\naforesaid provisions of law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\">9.        By order dated 16.07.2016, the trial court framed the\n\ncharge against the appellant under the aforesaid provisions who\n\npleaded not guilty. Thereafter, the trial court issued summons to\n\nthe prosecution witnesses.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_12\">10.       It may also be mentioned that the Home Department,\n\nGovernment of U.P. passed an order on 13.01.2017, stating that\n\nthe earlier sanction granted by the Hon’ble Governor on\n\n25.08.2015 was modified whereafter the Hon’ble Governor granted\n\nfull sanction for prosecution of the appellant in the aforesaid case\n\nfor commission of the offence under <a href=\"/doc/122170/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 16</a> of the UAP Act\n\nwhich is punishable under <a href=\"/doc/5268862/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 45(2)</a> of the aforesaid Act.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">\f                                 5</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_13\">11.       Appellant filed an application before the High Court\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 482</a> of Cr.P.C. for quashing of the order dated\n\n27.05.2016 passed by the trial court whereby the application for\n\ndischarge moved by the appellant was rejected. He also sought for\n\nquashing of the order dated 16.07.2016 passed by the trial court\n\nframing charge against the appellant.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_14\">11.1.     The High Court by the order dated 08.10.2021 took the\n\nview that no cognizance could have been taken by the trial court\n\nagainst the appellant in the absence of any valid sanction of\n\nprosecution for the offence under <a href=\"/doc/122170/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 16</a> of the UAP Act. The\n\nHigh Court held that although sanction for prosecution had been\n\nobtained, yet the same was not based upon recommendation after\n\nan independent review of the evidence collected during the course\n\nof investigation by the appropriate authority as required under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/5268862/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 45(2)</a> of the UAP Act. According to the High Court, it was a\n\nclear case of non-application of mind as the State failed to comply\n\nwith the mandatory statutory provision under <a href=\"/doc/5268862/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 45</a> of the\n\nUAP Act. Thus, the sanction orders dated 25.08.2015 and\n\n13.01.2017 were held to be invalid. Therefore, the trial court was\n\nbarred from taking cognizance under <a href=\"/doc/122170/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 16</a> of the UAP Act.\n\nConsequently, the order of cognizance dated 27.05.2016 passed by\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">\f                                   6</span>\n\n\nthe trial court in Case No. 940 of 2015 in so far the offence under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/122170/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 16</a> of the UAP Act was concerned as well as the charge to\n\nthe extent of <a href=\"/doc/122170/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 16</a> of the UAP Act were quashed. The trial\n\ncourt was directed to proceed with the trial only with respect to the\n\nrest of the offences under <a href=\"/doc/1926477/\" id=\"a_27\">Sections 489B</a> and <a href=\"/doc/257920/\" id=\"a_28\">489C</a> IPC against the\n\nappellant.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_15\">12.          State of U.P. assailed the order of the High Court dated\n\n08.10.2021 before this Court by filing Special Leave to Appeal\n\n(Criminal) No. 861 of 2022. This Court by order dated 11.02.2022\n\nissued notice and in the meanwhile directed stay of the order of\n\nthe High Court dated 08.10.2021.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_16\">13.          On 20.02.2024, this Court on perusal of the materials\n\nplaced before the Court, noted that subsequent development had\n\ntaken place whereby sanction was granted vide order dated\n\n15.12.2021 after the order of the High Court. In view of the\n\nsubsequent development, this Court declined to examine the issue\n\non merit leaving it open to the State Government to apply before\n\nthe High Court seeking permission to proceed in the matter for the\n\noffence under the <a href=\"/doc/1389751/\" id=\"a_29\">UAP Act</a> on the basis of the subsequent\n\ndevelopment. It was clarified that on filing of such proceedings, the\n\nHigh Court would be at liberty to consider the issue and decide the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">\f                                     7</span>\n\n\nsame affording due opportunity to all concerned without being\n\ninfluenced by the observations made in the order of the High Court\n\ndated 08.10.2021. Consequently, the Special Leave to Appeal\n\n(Criminal) No. 861 of 2022 was disposed of.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_17\">14.        In the meanwhile, appellant moved the High Court for\n\nregular bail under <a href=\"/doc/1290514/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 439</a> Cr.P.C. which came to be registered\n\nas Criminal Miscellaneous Bail Application No. 2282 of 2021. By\n\nthe impugned order dated 03.04.2023, the High Court observed\n\nthat the charges levelled against the appellant are grave. Though\n\nthe appellant is in jail since the last eight years and evidence of\n\nonly two witnesses had been recorded, appellant could not be\n\nreleased on bail since he belongs to Nepal and that there is a strong\n\nprobability   of   the   appellant       evading   trial   by   absconding.\n\nAccordingly, the bail application has been rejected.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_18\">15.        Mr. M.S. Khan, learned counsel for the appellant\n\nsubmits that appellant is in custody for more than nine years now.\n\nThere is no possibility of the criminal trial being concluded in the\n\nnear future. Therefore, the appellant should be enlarged on bail.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_19\">16.        On the other hand, Ms. Garima Prasad, learned\n\nAdditional Advocate General for the State of U.P. submits that the\n\ncharges against the appellant are very serious in nature. Besides,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">\f                                       8</span>\n\n\nhe being a foreign national, there is an attendant flight risk.\n\nTherefore, appellant may not be released on bail; instead the trial\n\ncourt may be directed to expedite the trial. Referring to the counter\n\naffidavit filed on behalf of the State of U.P., she submits that\n\nappellant is an accused under the <a href=\"/doc/1389751/\" id=\"a_31\">UAP Act</a> and is, therefore, not\n\nentitled to bail. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"9112004\" id=\"span_15\">In this connection, she has referred to a recent\n\ndecision of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/9112004/\" id=\"a_32\">Gurwinder Singh Vs. State of Punjab1</a>.</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_20\">17.               Submissions made by learned counsel for the parties\n\nhave been duly considered.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_21\">18.               We have already noticed that the appellant is in jail\n\nsince 23.02.2015. Now we are in July 2024. Nine years have gone\n\nby in the meanwhile. As per the impugned order, evidence of only\n\ntwo witnesses have been recorded. In the course of hearing, the\n\nBench had queried learned counsel for the parties as to the stage\n\nof the trial; how many witnesses the prosecution seeks to examine\n\nand evidence of the number of witnesses recorded so far.\n\nUnfortunately, counsel for either side could not apprise the Court\n\nabout the aforesaid. On the contrary, learned state counsel sought\n\nfor time to obtain instructions. Having regard to the fact that\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">1</span>\n    (2024) SCC Online SC 109\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">\f                                 9</span>\n\n\nappellant is in custody for more than nine years now, we declined\n\nthe prayer of the learned state counsel seeking further time.\n\nLearned counsel for the parties were also unable to tell us as to\n\nwhether the State has moved the High Court after the order of this\n\nCourt dated 20.02.2024 and whether any order has been passed\n\nby the High Court on the same.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_22\">19.       As already noted above, appellant is in custody for more\n\nthan nine years now. The impugned order says that evidence of\n\nonly two witnesses have been recorded. In such circumstances, a\n\nreasonable view can be taken that the trial is likely to take\n\nconsiderable time.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_23\">20.       Before proceeding further, let us briefly look at the\n\nsections invoked against the appellant. <a href=\"/doc/1926477/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 489B</a> IPC deals\n\nwith the offence of using forged or counterfeit currency notes or\n\nbank notes as genuine despite knowing the same to be forged or\n\ncounterfeit. Conviction for such an offence would result in\n\npunishment of imprisonment for life or with punishment of either\n\ndescription for a term which may extend to ten years and shall also\n\nbe liable to fine. Offence under <a href=\"/doc/257920/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 489C</a> IPC is committed\n\nwhen one is found in possession of any forged or counterfeit\n\ncurrency notes or bank notes despite knowing the same to be\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">\f                                  10</span>\n\n\nforged or counterfeit and intending to use the same as genuine.\n\nPunishment for such an offence is imprisonment of either\n\ndescription for a term which may extend to seven years or with fine\n\nor with both.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_24\">20.1.      <a href=\"/doc/122170/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 16</a> of the UAP Act provides for punishment for\n\ncommitting a ‘terrorist act’. ‘Terrorist act’ is defined in <a href=\"/doc/503626/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 15</a>.\n\nFor the present case, the definition which would be relevant is that\n\na person commits a ‘terrorist act’ if he does any act with the\n\nintention to threaten or likely to threaten the economic security of\n\nIndia i.e. damage to the monetary stability of India by way of\n\nproduction or smuggling or circulation of ‘high quality counterfeit\n\nIndian paper currency’, coin or of any other material. Explanation\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_25\">(b) explains ‘high quality counterfeit Indian currency’. In such a\n\ncase, the punishment under <a href=\"/doc/122170/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 16</a> would be imprisonment\n\nfor a term which shall not be less than five years but which may\n\nextend to imprisonment for life and shall also be liable to fine.\n\n20.2.      <a href=\"/doc/96524627/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 43D</a> of the UAP Act says that there shall be\n\nmodified application of certain provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_39\">Cr.P.C</a>. As per sub-\n\nSection (5) of <a href=\"/doc/96524627/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 43D</a>, which starts with a non-obstante clause,\n\nnotwithstanding anything contained in the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_41\">Cr.P.C</a>, no person\n\naccused of an offence punishable under Chapters IV (which\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">\f                                 11</span>\n\n\nincludes <a href=\"/doc/122170/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 16</a>) and VI of the UAP Act shall, if in custody, be\n\nreleased on bail or on his own bond unless the public prosecutor\n\nhas been given an opportunity of being heard on the bail\n\napplication. The proviso says that such accused person shall not\n\nbe released on bail or on his own bond if the court on a perusal of\n\nthe case diary or the report made under <a href=\"/doc/1412034/\" id=\"a_43\">Section 173</a> Cr.P.C. is of\n\nthe opinion that there are reasonable grounds for believing that\n\nthe accusation against such person is prima-facie true. Sub-\n\nSection (6) clarifies that the restrictions on granting of bail\n\nspecified in sub-Section (5) would be in addition to the restrictions\n\nunder the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_44\">Cr.P.C</a>. or any other law for the time being in force on\n\ngranting of bail.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_26\">21.        It is true that the appellant is facing charges under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1926477/\" id=\"a_45\">Section 489B</a> IPC and under <a href=\"/doc/122170/\" id=\"a_46\">Section 16</a> of the UAP Act which\n\ncarries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, if convicted. On\n\nthe other hand, the maximum sentence under <a href=\"/doc/257920/\" id=\"a_47\">Section 489C</a> IPC is\n\n7 years. But as noticed above, the trial is proceeding at a snail’s\n\npace. As per the impugned order, only two witnesses have been\n\nexamined. Thus, it is evident that the trial would not be concluded\n\nin the near future.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">\f                                   12</span><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_27\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_28\">22.        It is trite law that an accused is entitled to a speedy trial.\n\nThis Court in a catena of judgments has held that an accused or\n\nan undertrial has a fundamental right to speedy trial which is\n\ntraceable to <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_48\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India. If the alleged\n\noffence is a serious one, it is all the more necessary for the\n\nprosecution to ensure that the trial is concluded expeditiously.\n\nWhen a trial gets prolonged, it is not open to the prosecution to\n\noppose bail of the accused-undertrial on the ground that the\n\ncharges are very serious. Bail cannot be denied only on the ground\n\nthat the charges are very serious though there is no end in sight\n\nfor the trial to conclude.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_29\">23.        This Bench in a recent decision dated 03.07.2024 in\n\nJaved Gulam Nabi Shaikh Vs. State of Maharashtra, Criminal\n\nAppeal No. 2787 of 2024, has held that howsoever serious a crime\n\nmay be, an accused has the right to speedy trial under the\n\nConstitution of India. That was also a case where fake counterfeit\n\nIndian currency notes were seized from the accused-appellant. He\n\nwas investigated by the National Investigating Agency (NIA) under\n\nthe <a href=\"/doc/51730711/\" id=\"a_49\">National Investigating Agency Act, 2008</a> and was charged\n\nunder the <a href=\"/doc/1389751/\" id=\"a_50\">UAP Act</a> alongwith <a href=\"/doc/1926477/\" id=\"a_51\">Sections 489B</a> and <a href=\"/doc/257920/\" id=\"a_52\">489C</a> IPC.

Long incarceration with the\n\nunlikelihood of the trial being completed in the near future is a\n\ngood ground to grant bail. This Court also distinguished <a href=\"/doc/165949346/\" id=\"a_82\">Section\n\n43D(5)</a> of the UAP Act from <a href=\"/doc/496325/\" id=\"a_83\">Section 37</a> of the NDPS Act. It has been\n\nheld as follows:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">           17. It is thus clear to us that the presence of\n           statutory restrictions like <a href=\"/doc/165949346/\" id=\"a_84\">Section 43-D(5)</a> of the\n           UAPA per se does not oust the ability of the\n           constitutional courts to grant bail on grounds of\n           violation of Part III of the Constitution. Indeed,\n           both the restrictions under a statute as well as\n           the powers exercisable under constitutional\n           jurisdiction can be well harmonised. Whereas at\n           commencement of proceedings, the courts are\n           expected to appreciate the legislative policy\n           against grant of bail but the rigours of such\n           provisions will melt down where there is no\n           likelihood of trial being completed within a\n           reasonable time and the period of incarceration\n           already undergone has exceeded a substantial\n           part of the prescribed sentence. Such an\n           approach     would    safeguard     against    the\n           possibility of provisions like <a href=\"/doc/165949346/\" id=\"a_85\">Section 43-D(5)</a> of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">\f                       19</span>\n\n\nthe UAPA being used as the sole metric for\ndenial of bail or for wholesale breach of\nconstitutional right to speedy trial.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">18. Adverting to the case at hand, we are\nconscious of the fact that the charges levelled\nagainst the respondent are grave and a serious\nthreat to societal harmony. Had it been a case\nat the threshold, we would have outrightly\nturned down the respondent&#x27;s prayer. However,\nkeeping in mind the length of the period spent\nby him in custody and the unlikelihood of the\ntrial being completed anytime soon, the High\nCourt appears to have been left with no other\noption except to grant bail. An attempt has been\nmade to strike a balance between the appellant&#x27;s\nright to lead evidence of its choice and establish\nthe   charges     beyond      any   doubt     and\nsimultaneously      the     respondent&#x27;s    rights\nguaranteed under Part III of our Constitution\nhave been well protected.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">19. Yet another reason which persuades us to\nenlarge the respondent on bail is that <a href=\"/doc/165949346/\" id=\"a_86\">Section\n43-D(5)</a> of the UAPA is comparatively less\nstringent than <a href=\"/doc/496325/\" id=\"a_87\">Section 37</a> of the NDPS Act.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_41\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"18346623\" id=\"span_42\">Unlike the NDPS Act where the competent court\nneeds to be satisfied that prima-facie the\naccused is not guilty and that he is unlikely to\ncommit another offence while on bail; there is\nno such precondition under UAPA. Instead,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">\f                                  20</span>\n\n\n            <a href=\"/doc/165949346/\" id=\"a_88\">Section 43-D(5)</a> of the UAPA merely provides\n            another possible ground for the competent court\n            to refuse bail, in addition to the well-settled\n            considerations like gravity of the offence,\n            possibility   of   tampering    with    evidence,\n            influencing the witnesses or chance of the\n            accused evading the trial by absconsion, etc.\n\n\n29.1.       Declining to interfering with the order of the High Court,\n\nthis Court in <a href=\"/doc/18346623/\" id=\"a_89\">K.A. Najeeb</a> (supra) dismissed the appeal of the Union\n\nof India.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_42\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"130290692\" id=\"span_44\">30.         Recently, this Court dealt with a matter where the\n\nappellant, a foreign national, is being prosecuted for offences\n\npunishable under <a href=\"/doc/704277/\" id=\"a_90\">Sections 8</a>, <a href=\"/doc/263398/\" id=\"a_91\">22</a>, <a href=\"/doc/654722/\" id=\"a_92\">23</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1252855/\" id=\"a_93\">29</a> of the NDPS Act. The\n\nappellant was arrested on 21.05.2014. The High Court had\n\ngranted bail to the appellant vide the order dated 31.05.2022 but\n\nhad incorporated certain conditions in the bail order because of\n\nwhich the appellant remained in custody despite having a bail\n\norder in his favour. One of the conditions was that the appellant,\n\na Nigerian national, should obtain a certificate of assurance from\n\nthe High Commission of Nigeria to the effect that the appellant\n\nwould not leave the country and would appear before the trial\n\ncourt on the dates fixed. Another condition imposed was that the\n\naccused should drop a pin on the google map to ensure that his\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">\f                                     21</span>\n\n\nlocation is available to the investigation officer at all times. This\n\nCourt as an interim measure had granted bail to the accused-\n\nappellant and thereafter passed a detailed judgment in <a href=\"/doc/130290692/\" id=\"a_94\">Frank Vitus\n\nVs. Narcotics Control Bureau, Criminal Appeal No.</a> 2814-15 of\n\n2024, decided on 08.07.2024. This Court after referring to earlier\n\ndecisions of this Court held that conditions of bail cannot be\n\narbitrary and fanciful. The expression ‘interest of justice’ finding\n\nplace in <a href=\"/doc/259682/\" id=\"a_95\">Section 437(3)</a> Cr.P.C. means only good administration of\n\njustice or advancing the trial process. It cannot be given any\n\nfurther broader meaning to curtail the liberty of an accused\n\ngranted bail. Courts cannot impose freakish conditions while\n\ngranting bail. Bail conditions must be consistent with the object of\n\ngranting bail. While imposing bail conditions, the constitutional\n\nrights of an accused who is ordered to be released on bail can be\n\ncurtailed only to the minimum extent required. Even when an\n\naccused is in jail, he cannot be deprived of his right to life which\n\nis a basic human right of every individual. This Court held that\n\nbail conditions cannot be so onerous so as to frustrate the order of\n\nbail itself.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_43\">30.1.          Thereafter, this Court held as follows:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">               7.1. We are dealing with a case of the accused\n               whose guilt is yet to be established. So long as he\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">\f                       22</span>\n\n\nis not held guilty, the presumption of innocence\nis applicable. He cannot be deprived of all his\nrights guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_96\">Article 21.</a> The Courts\nmust    show    restraint   while   imposing    bail\nconditions. Therefore, while granting bail, the\nCourts can curtail the freedom of the accused\nonly to the extent required for imposing the bail\nconditions warranted by law. Bail conditions\ncannot be so onerous as to frustrate the order of\nbail itself. For example, the Court may impose a\ncondition of   periodically reporting to the police\nstation/Court or not travelling abroad without\nprior permission. Where circumstances require,\nthe Court may impose a condition restraining an\naccused from entering a particular area to protect\nthe prosecution witnesses or the victims. But the\nCourt cannot impose a condition on the accused\nto keep the Police constantly informed about his\nmovement from one place to another. The object\nof the bail condition cannot be to keep a constant\nvigil on the movements of the accused enlarged\non bail. The investigating agency cannot be\npermitted to continuously peep into the private\nlife of the accused enlarged on bail, by imposing\narbitrary conditions since that will violate the\nright of privacy of the accused, as guaranteed by\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_97\">Article 21.</a> If a constant vigil is kept on every\nmovement of the accused released on bail by the\nuse of technology or otherwise, it will infringe the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">\f                                 23</span>\n\n\n          rights of the accused guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_98\">Article\n          21</a>, including the right to privacy. The reason is\n          that the effect of keeping such constant vigil on\n          the accused by imposing drastic bail conditions\n          will amount to keeping the accused in some kind\n          of confinement even after he is released on bail.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_44\">          Such a condition cannot be a condition of bail.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_45\">                              ***********\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_46\">          9.    A condition cannot be imposed while\n          granting bail which is impossible for the accused\n          to comply with. If such a condition is imposed, it\n          will deprive an accused of bail, though he is\n          otherwise entitled to it.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_47\">30.2.     In so far the condition that the accused should drop a\n\npin on the google map, this Court referred to the affidavit filed\n\nGoogle LLC wherein it was stated that the user has full control over\n\nsharing of pin with other users; pin location does not enable real\n\ntime tracking of the user or a user’s device. Therefore, this Court\n\nfound that such a condition was completely redundant. Thereafter,\n\nthis Court held that imposing any bail condition which enables the\n\npolice/investigating agency to track every movement of the\n\naccused released on bail by use of technology or otherwise would\n\nundoubtedly violate the right to privacy of the accused guaranteed\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_99\">Article 21.</a>\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">\f                                 24</span><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_48\">\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"136788839\" id=\"span_49\">30.3.     Distinguishing the decision of this Court in Supreme\n\nCourt <a href=\"/doc/136788839/\" id=\"a_100\">Legal Aid Committee (Representing Undertrial Prisoners</a>)\n\n(supra), this Court observed that an accused-undertrial has no\n\ncontrol over the Embassy or High Commission of his country. On\n\nfailure of the Embassy or High Commission to issue a certificate\n\nthat the accused-undertrial would not flee from the country and\n\nwould attend the trial proceedings regularly, he cannot be\n\ncontinued to be kept in detention despite a bail order. Instead of\n\nthe same, other practical and pragmatic conditions may be\n\nimposed.</span> This Court clarified that it is not necessary that in every\n\ncase where bail is granted to the accused in an NDPS case who is\n\na foreign national, the condition of obtaining a certificate of\n\nassurance from the Embassy or the High Commission should be\n\nincorporated. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"130290692\" id=\"span_50\">Consequently, in <a href=\"/doc/130290692/\" id=\"a_101\">Frank Vitus</a> (supra), this Court\n\nwhile confirming the bail granted to the appellant, set aside the\n\ntwo impugned conditions.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_49\">31.       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"18346623\" id=\"span_51\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"18346623\" id=\"span_52\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"9112004\" id=\"span_53\">In <a href=\"/doc/9112004/\" id=\"a_102\">Gurwinder Singh</a> (supra) on which reliance has been\n\nplaced by the respondent, a two Judge Bench of this Court\n\ndistinguished <a href=\"/doc/18346623/\" id=\"a_103\">K.A.

It was in that context,\n\nthe two Judge Bench of this Court in Gurwinder Singh observed\n\nthat mere delay in trial pertaining to grave offences cannot be used\n\nas a ground to grant bail.</span></span></span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_50\">32.        This Court has, time and again, emphasized that right\n\nto life and personal liberty enshrined under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_106\">Article 21</a> of the\n\nConstitution   of   India    is   overarching   and   sacrosanct.   A\n\nconstitutional court cannot be restrained from granting bail to an\n\naccused on account of restrictive statutory provisions in a penal\n\nstatute if it finds that the right of the accused-undertrial under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_107\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India has been infringed. In that\n\nevent, such statutory restrictions would not come in the way. Even\n\nin the case of interpretation of a penal statute, howsoever stringent\n\nit may be, a constitutional court has to lean in favour of\n\nconstitutionalism and the rule of law of which liberty is an intrinsic\n\npart. In the given facts of a particular case, a constitutional court\n\nmay decline to grant bail. But it would be very wrong to say that\n\nunder a particular statute, bail cannot be granted. It would run\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\">\f                                    26</span>\n\n\ncounter to the very grain of our constitutional jurisprudence. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"18346623\" id=\"span_56\">In\n\nany view of the matter, <a href=\"/doc/18346623/\" id=\"a_108\">K.A. Najeeb</a> (supra) being rendered by a\n\nthree Judge Bench is binding on a Bench of two Judges like us.</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_51\">33.        Thus, having regard to the discussions made above, we\n\nare of the considered view that continued incarceration of the\n\nappellant cannot be justified.
