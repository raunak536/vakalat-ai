However, in the\nGovernment Order dated 18.07.1996 read at (2) above, the State\nGovernment after careful consideration of all aspects of the case,\nrescinded the Government Order No. DPAR 67 SPS 91 dated\n23.12.1991 declaring the posts of DySP Wireless, Assistant\nCommandant KSRP, DySP Armed as equivalent to the Principal\nPolice Service of the State.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">Subsequently, in the Government Order dated 01.1 0.2020 read at\n(3) above, the State Government again declared equivalence between\nthe Civil Police Service and Auxiliary Police Services.

Bench Challenging condition\nnumber 2 and 3 Stipulated in the Government Order dated\n07.10.2010. During the pendency of the said Application, the\nGovernment, after considering the fact that it is not proper and in\npublic interest to declare the posts of Auxiliary Police Services as\nequivalent to Civil Police Services, rescinded the Government Order\nNo. DPAR 115 SPS 2010 dated 01.10.2010 vide Government order\ndated 21.07.2011 cited at (4) above. In the meantime, the Hon&#x27;ble\nCAT in its order dated 07. 12.2011 in OA no. 471/2010 read at (5)\nabove, held that because of the operation of <a href=\"/doc/175804277/\" id=\"a_1\">section 3</a> of the\nKarnataka Police Act, there exists only one single police force from\n15.05.1975 onwards and equivalence required under regulation, Rule\n2 stands satisfied.

Pursuant to the said Notification,\nthe Government of India appointed Shri Nandan Nilekhani, an entrepreneur,\n\nas the Chairman of the UIDAI on July 02, 2009. According to this scheme, -\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_32\">every citizen of India is entitled to enrol herself/himself with jt and get a\nunique, randomnly selected 12 digit number. For such enrolment, every\n&quot;person so intending would have to provide his/her personal information\nalong with biometric details such a fingerprints and iris scan for future\nidentification. Accordingly, it is intended to create a centralized database\nunder the UIDAI with all the above information. The scheme was launched\nin September 2010 in the rural areas of Maharashtra and thereafter\nextended all over India. One of the objects of the entire project was non-\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_33\">_ duplication and elimination of fake identity cards. .\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_34\">6) On December 03, 2010, the National Identification Authority of India Bill\n2010 was introduced in the Rajya Sabha. On December 13, 201 1, the\n~ Standing Committee Report was submitted to the Parliament stating that\nboth the Bill and project should be re-considered. The Parliamentary\nStanding Committee on Finance rejected the Bill of 2010 as there was\nopposition to the passing of the aforesaid Bill by the Parliament. Be that as it\n_ may, the said Bill of 2010 did not get through. The result was that as on that\ndate, Aadhaar Scheme was not having any statutory backing but was\n_ launched and continued to operate in exercise of executive power of the\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_35\">- Government. It may also be mentioned. that the Government appointed\nprivate enrollers and. these private collection/enrolment centres run by\n\n_ private parties continued to enrol the citizens under the UID scheme.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_36\">~~ 7) Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012, under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_11\">Article 32</a> of the Constitution of\nIndia, was preferred by Justice K.S.

All the authorities are\ndirected to modify their forms/circulars/likes so as to not compulsorily require\nthe Aadhaar number in order to meet the requirement of the interim order\n\npassed by this Court forthwith.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_38\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"619152\" id=\"span_12\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1306519\" id=\"span_13\">appearing for the petitioners as well as the Attorney General for India who\nappeared on behalf of the Union of India. As stated above, one of the main\ngrounds of attack on Aadhaar Card scheme was that the very collection of\nbiometric data is violative of the Right to Privacy&#x27;, which, in turn, violated not\nonly <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_13\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India but other Articles embodying the\nfundamental rights guaranteed under Part Ill of the Constitution. This\nargument was sought to be rebutted by the respondents with the submission\nthat in view of eight Judges&#x27; Bench judgment of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/1306519/\" id=\"a_14\">M.P. Sharma &amp;\nOrs. v. Satish Chandra &amp; Ors.1</a> and that of six Judges&#x27; Bench in <a href=\"/doc/619152/\" id=\"a_15\">Kharak\nSingh v. State of U.P. &amp; Ors.</a> 2, the legal position regarding the existence of\nfundamental Right to Privacy is doubtful. At the same time, it was also\naccepted that subsequently smaller Benches of two or three Judges of this\nCourt had given the judgments recognising the Right to Privacy as part\nof <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_16\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. On that basis, respondents submitted that\n\nthe matters were required to be heard by a Larger Bench to debate\nimportant questions like: .</span></span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_39\">(i) Whether there is any Right to Privacy guaranteed under the Constitution;\nand\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">14 OA.No.170/00182/2020/CAT/BANGALORE &amp;</span>\nCP.No.170/00141/2019/CAT/BANGALORE\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_40\">(ii) If such a Right exists, what is the source and what are the contours of\n\nsuch a Right as there is no express provision in the Constitution\nadumbrating the Right to Privacy.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_41\">10) Though, this suggestion of the respondents were opposed by the\ncounsel for the petitioners, the said Bench still deemed it proper to refer the\nmatter to the Larger Bench and the reasons for taking this course of action\nare mentioned in paras 12 and 13 of the 1 AIR 1954 SC 300 2 AIR: 1963 SC\n1295 order dated August 11, 2015 which reads as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_44\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"619152\" id=\"span_15\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1306519\" id=\"span_16\">&quot;12. We are of the opinion that the cases on hand raise far reaching\nquestions of importance involving interpretation of the Constitution. What is\nat stake is the amplitude of the fundamental nights including that precious\nand inalienable right under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_17\">Article 21.</a> If the observations made in <a href=\"/doc/1306519/\" id=\"a_18\">MP.\nSharma</a> (supra) and <a href=\"/doc/619152/\" id=\"a_19\">Kharak Singh</a> (supra) are to be read literally and\naccepted as the law of this country, the fundamental rights guaranteed\nunder the Constitution of India and more particularly right to liberty\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_20\">Article 21</a> would be denuded of vigour and vitality. At the same time,\nwe are also of the opinion that the institutional integrity and judicial discipline\nrequire that pronouncement made by larger Benches of this Court cannot be\nignored by the smaller Benches without appropriately explaining the reasons\nfor not following the pronouncements made by such larger Benches. With\ndue respect to all the learned Judges who rendered the subsequent\njudgments -- where right to privacy is asserted or referred to their Lordships\nconcern for the liberty of human beings, we are of the humble opinion that\n\nthere appears to be certain amount of apparent unresolved contradiction in\nthe law declared by this Court.</span></span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_45\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"619152\" id=\"span_17\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1306519\" id=\"span_18\">13. Therefore, in our opinion to give a quietus to the kind of controversy\nraised in this batch of cases once for all, it is better that ratio decidendi of\n<a href=\"/doc/1306519/\" id=\"a_21\">M.P. Sharma</a> (supra) and <a href=\"/doc/619152/\" id=\"a_22\">Kharak Singh</a> (supra) is scrutinized and the\njurisprudential correctness of the subsequent decisions of this Court where\nthe right to privacy is either asserted or referred be examined and\nauthoritatively decided by a Bench of appropriate strength. .</span></span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_46\">(emphasis supplied)&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_42\">11) While referring the matter as aforesaid, by another order of the even\ndate, the Bench expressed that it would be desirable that the matter be\n_ heard at the earliest. On the same day, yet another order was passed by the\nBench in those petitions giving certain interim directions which would prevail\ntill the matter is finally decided by the Larger Bench. We would like to\nreproduce this order containing the said interim arrangement in toto: |\n\nINTERIM ORDER\n\nAfter the matter was referred for decision bya larger Bench, the learned\ncounsel for the petitioners prayed for further interim orders. The last interim\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">15 OA.No.170/00182/2020/CAT/BANGALORE &amp;</span>\nCP.No.170/00141/2019/CAT/BANGALORE\n\norder in force is the order of this Court dated 23.9.2013 which reads as\nfollows:- OS\n\n&#x27;All the matters require to be heard finally. List all matters for final hearing\nafter the Constitution Bench is over.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_43\">In the meanwhile, no person should suffer for not getting the Aadhaar card\ninspite of the fact that some authority had issued a circular making it\nmandatory and when any person applies to get the Aadhaar card voluntarily,\nit may be checked whether that person is entitled for it under the law and it\nshould not be given to any illegal immigrant.&quot; It was submitted by Shri\nShyam Divan, learned counsel for the petitioners that the petitioners having\npointed out a serious breach of privacy in their submissions, preceding the\nreference, this Court may grant an injunction restraining the authorities from\nproceeding further in the matter of obtaining biometrics etc. for an Aadhaar\ncard. Shri Shyam Divan submitted that the biometric information of an\nindividual can be circulated to other authorities or corporate bodies which, in\n\nturn can be used by them for commercial exploitation and, therefore, must\nbe stopped.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_44\">The learned Attorney General pointed out, on the other hand, that this Court\nhas at no point of time, even while making the interim order dated 23.9. 2013\ngranted an injunction restraining the Unique Identification Authority of India\nfrom going ahead and obtaining biometric or other information from a citizen\nfor the purpose of a Unique Identification Number, better known as &quot;Aadhaar\ncard&quot;. It was further submitted that the respondents have gone ahead with\nthe project and have issued Aadhaar cards to about 90% of the population.\nAlso that a large amount of money has been spent by the Union\nGovernment on this project for issuing Aadhaar cards and that in the\n\ncircumstances, none of the well-known consideration for grant of injunction\nare in favour of the petitioners.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_45\">The learned Attorney General stated that the respondents do not share any\npersonal information of an Aadhaar card holder through biometrics or\notherwise with any other person or authority. This statement allays. the\napprehension for now, that there is a widespread breach of privacy of those\nto whom an Aadhaar card has been issued. It was further contended on\nbehalf of the petitioners that there still is breach of privacy. This is a matter\nwhich need not be gone into further at this stage.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_46\">The learned Attorney General has further submitted that the Aadhaar card is\nof great benefit since it ensures an effective implementation of several social\nbenefit schemes of the Government like MGNREGA, the distribution of food,\nration and kerosene through PDS system and grant of subsidies in the\ndistribution of LPG. It was, therefore, submitted that restraining the\nrespondents from issuing further Aadhaar cards or fully utilising the existing\nAadhaar cards for the social schemes of the Government should be allowed.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">16 OA.No.170/00182/2020/CAT/BANGALORE &amp;</span>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_47\">CP.No.170/00141/2019/CAT/BANGALORE\n\nThe learned Attorney General further stated that the respondent Union of\nIndia _would ensure that Aadhaar cards would only be issued on a\n\nconsensual basis after informing the public at large about the fact that the\n\n__ preparation of Aadhaar card involving the parting of biometric information of -\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_48\">the individual, which shall however not be used for any purpose other than a\nSocial benefit schemes. ee a\n\nHaving considered the matter, we are of the view that the balance of interest\nwould be best served, till the matter is finally decided by a larger Bench if\n\nthe Union of India or the UIDA proceed in the following manner.-\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_49\">4. The Union of India: shall give wide publicity in the electronic and print\n\nmedia including radio and television networks that it is not mandatory for a\ncitizen to obtain an Aadhaar card; Ae\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_50\">2. The production of an Aadhaar card will not be condition for obtaining any\nbenefits otherwise due to a citizen; :\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_51\">3. The Unique Identification Number or the Aadhaar card will not be used by\nthe respondents for any purpose other than the PDS Scheme and in\n\nparticular for the purpose of distribution of foodgrains, etc. and cooking fuel,\n\nsuch as kerosene. The Aadhaar card may also be used for the purpose of\nthe LPG Distribution Scheme; . .\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_52\">4, The information about an individual obtained by the Unique Identification\nAuthority of India while issuing an Aadhaar card shall not be used for any\n\nother purpose, Save as above, except as may be directed by a Court for the\n\npurpose of criminal investigation. Ordered accordingly.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_53\">12) In nutshell, the direction is that obtaining an. Aadhaar Card is not\nmandatory and the benefits due to a citizen under any scheme are not to be\ndenied in the absence of Aadhaar Card... Further, unique identification\nnumber or the Aadhaar Card was to be used only for the PDS Scheme and,\n\n~ in particular, for the purpose of distribution of food grains etc. and cooking\nfuels such as Kerosene and LPG Distribution Scheme, with clear mandate\n~~ that it will not be used by the respondents for any other purpose. Even the\n\ninformation about the individual.collected while. issuing an Aadhaar Card\nwas not to be used for any other purpose, except when it is directed by the\n\n_ Court for the purpose of criminal investigation. Thus, making of Aadhaar\nCard was not to be made mandatory and it was to be used only for PDS\n\n__.Scheme and LPG Distribution Scheme. Thereafter, certain applications for\n~ &quot;modification of the aforesaid order dated August 11; 2015 was filed: before\n\nthis Court by the Union of India and.a-five Judges Bench of this Court was\npleased to pass the following order:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_47\">3. After hearing the learned Attorney General for India and other learned\n\nsenior counsels, we are of the view. that in paragraph 3 of the Order dated\n\nAugust 11, 2015, if we add, apart from the other two Schemes, namely, PDS eo&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">17 OA.No.170/00182/2020/CAT/BANGALORE &amp;</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_48\">CP.No.170/00141/2019/CAT/BANGALORE\n\nScheme and the LPG Distribution Scheme, the Schemes like The Mahatma\nGandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme 12 (MGNREGS),\nNational Social Assistance Programme (Old Age Pensions, Widow\nPensions, Disability Pensions) Prime Minister&#x27;s Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY)\nand Employees&#x27; Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) .for the present, it\nwould not dilute earlier order passed by this Court. Therefore, we now\ninclude the aforesaid Schemes apart from the other two Schemes that this\nCourt has permitted in its earlier order dated August 11, 2015.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_54\">4. We impress upon the Union of India that it shall strictly follow all the\nearlier orders passed by this Court commencing from September 23, 2013.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_55\">5. We will also make it clear that the Aadhaar card Scheme is purely\nvoluntary and it cannot be made mandatory till the matter is finally decided\n\nby this Court one way or the other.&quot; Thus, Aadhaar is permitted for some\nmore schemes as well.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_56\">13) The petitioner herein, laying stress on the above orders, plead that from\na perusal of the various interim orders passed by this Court it is amply clear\n_ that the Court has reiterated the position that although there is no interim\norder against the collection of information from the citizens for the purpose\nof enrolment for Aadhaar, the scheme is purely voluntary and the same is\nnot to be made mandatory by the Government.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_57\">14) While matters stood thus, the Government of India brought in a\nlegislation to govern the Aadhaar Scheme with the enactment of the\nAadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and other subsidies, benefits. and\nservices) Act, 2016 (hereinafter referred to as the Aadhaar Act&#x27;).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_58\">15) Introduction to the said Act gives thé reasons for passing that Act and\nStatement of Objects and Reasons mention the objectives sought to be\nachieved with the enactment of Aadhaar Act. Introduction reads as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_49\">&quot;The Unique Identification Authority of India was established by a resolution\nof the Government of India in 2009. {If was meant primarily to lay down\npolicies and to implement the Unique Identification Scheme, by which\nresidents of India were to be provided unique identity number. This number\nwould serve as proof of identity and could be used for identification of\nbeneficiaries for transfer of benefits, subsidies, services and other purposes.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_50\">Later on, it was felt that the process of enrolment, authentication, security,\nconfidentiality and use of Aadhaar related information be made statutory so\nas to facilitate the use of Aadhaar number for delivery of various benefits,\nsubsidies and services, the expenditures of which were incurred from or\nreceipts therefrom formed part of the Consolidated Fund of India.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_51\">The Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits\nand Services) Bill 2016 inter alia, provides for establishment of Unique\n\nIdentification Authority of India, issuance of Aadhaar number to individuals, a\n\nLn\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">18 OA.No.170/00182/2020/CAT/BANGALORE &amp;</span>\n.

Statement of Objects and Reasons\nalso discloses that over a period of time, the use of Aadhaar Number has\nbeen increased manifold and, therefore, it is also necessary to take\nmeasures relating to ensuring security of the information provided by the\nindividuals while enrolling for Aadhaar Card. Having these parameters in\nmind, para 5 of the Statement of Objects and Reasons enumerates the\nobjectives which Aadhaar Act seeks to achieve.

The Arguments\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_76\">20) Mr. Datar, learned senior counsel who opened the attack on behalf of\nthe petitioners, started by stating the historical fact pertaining to introduction\nof Aadhaar Scheme, leading to the passing of Aadhaar Act and thereafter\nthe impugned provision and referring to the various orders passed by this\nCourt from time to time (which have already been reproduced above). After\nthis narration, his first submission was that this Court had, time and again,\nemphasised by various interim orders that obtaining an Aadhaar Card would\nbe a voluntarily act on behalf of a citizen and it would not be made\nmandatory till the pendency of the petitions which stand referred to the\n\nperson is not to be deprived of subsidies as per the various schemes of the\nGovernment as the said proviso clearly mentions that if an Aadhaar Number\nis not assigned to an individual, he shall be offered alternate and viable\nmeans of identification for delivery of subsidy, benefit or Service. According\nto him, there was a total reversal] of the aforesaid approach for assessees\nunder the <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_49\">Income Tax Act</a> and those who wanted to apply for issuance of\n\nassessees had to become invalid, that too from the retrospective effect i.e.\nfrom the date when it is issued Having regard &#x27;to the aforesaid, the legal\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_77\">21) Dilating on the aforesaid submissions, Mr. Datar argued that the earlier\norders of this Court dated August 23, (2015 of the main writ petition\nspecifically permitted Aadhaar to be used only for LPG and PDS. By an\norder dated October 15, 2015, at the request of the Union of India, it was\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">24 OA.No.170/00182/2020/CAT/BANGALORE &amp;</span>\nCP.No.170/00141/2019/CAT/BANGALORE\n\npermitted to be extended to three other schemes, namely, MNREGA, Jan\nDhan Yojana etc. The Constitution Bench made it explicitly clear that the\nAadhaar scheme could not be used for any other purpose. According to\nhim, the Parliament did not in any manner remove the basis of these\n_ decisions. The Aadhaar scheme, as enacted under the Aadhaar Act,\n\ncontinued to retain its voluntary character (as demonstrated by <a href=\"/doc/1869099/\" id=\"a_50\">Section 3</a> of\nthat Act) that existed when Aadhaar was operating under executive\ninstructions. Nonetheless, even if it is argued that the above orders were\npassed when Aadhaar was based on executive instructions, decisions of\nthis Court continue to be binding as they are made in exercise of the judicial\npower. According to Mr. Datar, any judgment of a court, whether interim or\nfinal, whether rendered in the context of a legislation, delegated legislation\n(rules/notifications) or even executive action will continue to be binding. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1446086\" id=\"span_29\">In\n_ view of the judgment of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/1446086/\" id=\"a_51\">Ram Jawaya Kapoor v. State of\nPunjab3</a>, which held that executive and legislative powers are co-extensive\nunder. the Constitutional scheme, unless the basis of the judgment is\nremoved by a subsequent enactment, it cannot be argued that a decision\nbased on executive instruction is less binding than other judgments/orders\n\nof the Supreme Court, or that the judgmenvt/order loses force if the executive\ninstruction is replaced by law.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_78\">3 (1955) 2 SCR 225\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_79\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"55098\" id=\"span_30\">22) He also referred to the decision in the case of <a href=\"/doc/55098/\" id=\"a_52\">Madan Mohan Pathak v.\nUnion of India4</a>, wherein the direction of the Calcutta High Court to pay\nbonus to Class-Ill and Class-IlV employees was sought to be nullified by a\nstatutory amendment.

He also relied upon <a href=\"/doc/125769/\" id=\"a_53\">Bakhtawar Trust v. M.D. Narayand</a>,\n\nwherein, after citing the case-laws on this point, the Court reiterated the\nprinciple as follows:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_89\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"125769\" id=\"span_32\">&quot;29. The decisions <a href=\"/doc/125769/\" id=\"a_54\">referred to above</a>, manifestly show that it is open to the\n_ legislature to alter the law retrospectively, provided the alteration is made in\nsuch a manner that it would no more be possible for the Court to arrive at\nthe same verdict. In other words, the very premise of the earlier judgment\nShould be uprooted, thereby resulting in a fundamental change of the\ncircumstances upon which it was founded. - /\nXXX XXX XXX SO\n\n_ 27, Here, the question before us is, whether the impugned Act has passed\nthe test of constitutionality by serving to remove the very basis upon which\nthe decision of the High Court in the writ. petition was based. This question\ngives rise to further two questions -- first, what &#x27;was the basis of the earlier\ndecision; and second, what, if any, may be said to be the removal of that\nbasis? .</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_90\">. (emphasis supplied)&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_81\">23) Based on the above principles, &#x27;Mr. Datar&#x27;s fervent plea was that:\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">25 OA.No.170/00182/2020/CAT/BANGALORE &amp;</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_91\">CP.No.170/00141/2019/CAT/BANGALORE\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_92\">(i) The basis of the earlier order of the Supreme Court is that Aadhaar will be\nmade a voluntary scheme, it is a 4 AIR 1978 SC 803 5 (2003) 5 SCC 298\n\nconsensual scheme, and that it is to be expressly limited to six specific\nPurposes; and\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_93\">(ii) No attempt whatsoever has been made to remove the basis of these\nearlier orders. This alone renders Section 139AA unconstitutional,\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_94\">24) Arguing that basis of the orders of this Court was not removed, plea of\nMr. Datar was that the basis of the said orders was that serious\n\nthese orders, the Parliament would have to pass a law overturning the\nvoluntary character of Aadhaar itself. Notably, although Parliament did have\na chance to do so, it elected not to. The Aadhaar Act came into force on\nMarch 25, 2016. This was after the order of this Court. Significantly,\nhowever, the Parliament continued to maintain Aadhaar as a voluntary\nScheme vide <a href=\"/doc/1869099/\" id=\"a_55\">Section 3</a> of the said Act. Mr. Datar submitted that if Parliament\nSO desired, it could have removed the basis of this Court&#x27;s order by:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_95\">(i) Amending <a href=\"/doc/1869099/\" id=\"a_56\">Section 3</a> so that Aadhaar is made compulsory for every\nresident of India; or\n\n| (ii) Introducing either a Proviso or adding a sub-section jn <a href=\"/doc/1869099/\" id=\"a_57\">Section 3</a> to the\nfollowing effect:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_96\">&#x27;Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1), the Central\n\nGovernment may notify specific purposes for which obtaining Aadhaar\nnumbers may be made mandatory in public interest.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_97\">25) However, Parliament elected not to do so as there is no non-obstante\nClause. Instead of making enrollment for Aadhaar itself mandatory, it made\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_98\">26) On the aforesaid edifice, the argument built and developed by Mr. Datar\nis that although the power of Parliament to pass laws with respect to List-|\nand List-IIl is plenary, it is subject to two implied limitations: »\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">26 OA.No.170/00182/2020/CAT/BANGALORE &amp;</span>\nCP.No.170/00141/2019/CAT/BANGALORE\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_99\">(i) Parliament or any State legislature cannot pass any law that overrules a\njudgment; before any law is passed which may result in nullifying a decision,\nit is mandatory to remove the basis of the decision. Once the basis on which\nthe earlier decision/order/judgment is delivered is removed, Parliament can\n\nthen pass a law prospectively or retrospectively and with or without a\nvalidation clause.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_100\">(ii) Implied limitation not to pass contrary laws: The doctrine of harmonious\nconstruction applies when there is an accidental collision or conflict between\ntwo enactments and the Supreme Court has repeatedly read down one\nprovision to give effect to other. Thus, both the provisions have to be given\neffect to. But if the collision or conflict is such that one provision cannot co-\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_82\">exist with another, then the latter provision must be struck down. In the\npresent case, obtaining an Aadhaar number continues to be voluntary and\nexplicitly declared to be so. Once the Aadhaar Card is voluntary, it cannot\nbe made mandatory by the impugned <a href=\"/doc/1965344/\" id=\"a_58\">Section 139AA</a> of the Act. As long as\nthe Aadhaar enactment holds the field, there is an implied limitation on the\npower of Parliament not to pass a contrary law. . .\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_83\">27) He also advanced two examples of such an implied limitation:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_101\">(i) If Parliament, by a statute, makes medical service in rural areas an\nattractive option for doctors with incentives like preference for post-graduate\nadmissions, higher pay/allowances, or even lower tax, such a scheme is\nvoluntary and only those doctors who want those benefits may opt for it.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_84\">While such a statute exists, it will not be permissible for Parliament to\nsimultaneously amend the <a href=\"/doc/118783942/\" id=\"a_59\">Medical Council Act, 1956</a> and state that absence\nof rural service will be a ground to invalidate the doctor&#x27;s certificate of\npractice. Thus, what is_ statutorily voluntary under one Parliamentary\n\nAct cannot be made statutorily compulsory under another Parliamentary\nAct at the same time. os mo a\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_85\">(ii) Second example given by Mr. Datar was that making Aadhaar\ncompulsory only for individuals with severe consequences of cancellation of\nPAN cards and a deeming provision that they had never applied for PAN is\ndiscriminatory when such a provision is not made mandatory for other\nassessees. _ . *\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_86\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"685234\" id=\"span_35\">28) Mr. Datar&#x27;s next plea of violation of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_60\">Article 14</a> was based by him on the\napplication of the twin-test of classification viz. there should be a reasonable\nclassification and that this classification should have rational nexus with the\nobjective sought to be achieved as held in <a href=\"/doc/685234/\" id=\"a_61\">R.K. Dalmia v. Justice S.R.\nTendolkar6</a>. Mr. Datar conceded that first test was met as: individual\nassessees form a separate class and, to this extent, there is a rational\ndifferentiation between individuals and other categories of assessees. The\nmain brunt of his argument was on the second limb of the twin-test of\n_ Classification which according to him is not satisfied because there is no\nrational nexus with the object sought to be achieved. .</span>\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">27 OA.No.170/00182/2020/CAT/BANGALORE &amp;</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_87\">CP.No.170/00141/2019/CAT/BANGALORE\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_88\">29) Third argument of Mr Datar was that the affected persons by Section\n139AA are individuals who are professionals like lawyers, doctors, architects\n\n(hereinafter referred to as the &#x27;Rules&#x27;), it will not be possible to operate bank\naccounts with transactions above Rs.50, O00/,, 6 ( 1959) SCR 279 use\ncredit/debit cards, purchase motor-vehicles, purchase Property etc.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_89\">30) Elaborating this point, it was submitted by him that once it is shown that\nthe right under <a href=\"/doc/81771913/\" id=\"a_62\">Article 1 9(1)(g)</a> has been infringed, the burden shifts to the\nState to show that the restriction is reasonable, and in the interests of the\n\nthis Court held that the correct test to apply in the context of <a href=\"/doc/626103/\" id=\"a_63\">Article\n19(6)</a> was the test of proportionality:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_102\">&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_90\">a\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_91\">(i) it is designated for a Proper purpose; (ii) the measures undertaken to\n\nHe questioned the wisdom of legislature jn compelling 99.6% of the\ntaxpaying citizenry to enrol! for Aadhaar (with the further. prospect of\n\nseeding) in order to weed out the 0.4% of duplicate PAN Cards, as it fails\nthe proportionality test entirely.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">28 OA.No.170/00182/2020/CAT/BANGALORE &amp;</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_92\">CP.No.170/00141/2019/CAT/BANGALORE\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_93\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"685234\" id=\"span_38\">32) On the principle of proportionality, he submitted that this principle was\napplied in the <a href=\"/doc/685234/\" id=\"a_64\">R. K. Dalmia8</a> case as per the following passage: --</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_94\">17...\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_95\">(d) that the Legislature is free to recognize degrees of harm and may\n\nconfine its restrictions to those cases where the need is deemed to be the\nclearest;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_96\">(e) that in order to sustain the presumption of constitutionality the court may\ntake into consideration matters of common knowledge, matters of common 8\nFootnote 6 above report, the history of the times and may assume every\nState of facts which can be conceived existing at the time of legislation...&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_97\">33) Basic premise of the submissions of Mr. Shyam Divan, learned senior\nadvocate, was also the same as projected by Mr. Datar. He insisted\nthat <a href=\"/doc/1965344/\" id=\"a_65\">Section 139AA</a> of the Act, which had made Aadhaar mandatory for\nincome-tax assessees, is unconstitutional. However, in his endeavour to\nplead that the provision be declared unconstitutional, he approached the\nsubject from an altogether different premise, giving another perception to the\nwhole issue. His basic submission was that every individual or citizen in this\ncountry had complete contro! over his/her body and State cannot insist any\nperson from giving his/her finger tips or iris of eyes, as a condition precedent\nto enjoy certain rights. He pointed out that all the petitioners in his writ\npetition were holding PAN Cards and were income-tax assessees but had\nnot enrolled under Aadhaar Scheme. They were the consentions persons in\nthe society and did not want to give away their finger tips or iris, being\nconsentions objectors, that too, to private persons who were engaged as\ncontractors/private enrollers by the Government for undertaking the job of\nenrolment under the Aadhaar. It was submitted that the data given to such\npersons were not safe and there was huge possibility that the same may be\nleaked. Further, requirement of giving Aadhaar number for every transaction\namounted to surveillance by the State and the entire profile of such persons\nwould be available to the State. He also pointed out that with today&#x27;s\ntechnology, there was every possibility of copying the fingerprint and even\nthe iris images. Various cases of fake Aadhaar Card had come to light and\neven as per the Government&#x27;s statement, 3.48 lakh bogus Aadhaar Cards\nwere cancelled. There were instances of Aadhaar leak as well Even\nhacking was possible. He conceded that these were the issues within the\nrealm of &#x27;Right to Privacy&#x27; which were to be decided by the Constitution\nBench. However, according to him, various orders passed by this Court in\nthose petitions clearly reflect that the Court had given the directions that\nAadhaar Scheme had to be voluntarily; there would not be any illegal\nimplants;.and no one would suffer any consequences if he does not enroll\nhimself under the Aadhaar Scheme. He also submitted that even the -\nAadhaar Act:was voluntary in nature which creates rights for citizens and not\nobligations. According to him, Aadhaar Act envisages free consent for\ngetting certain benefits under social welfare schemes of the Government. a\nOn the other hand, <a href=\"/doc/1965344/\" id=\"a_66\">Section 139AA</a> of the Act is compulsory and coercive, »~~ \\\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">29 OA.No.170/00182/2020/CAT/BANGALORE &amp;</span>\nCP.No.170/00141/2019/CAT/BANGALORE\n\nPointing out that if Aadhaar number is not mentioned in the income-tax\nreturns, the effect provided under <a href=\"/doc/1965344/\" id=\"a_67\">Section 139AA</a> of the Act is that the PAN\nCard held by such a person would itself become invalid and inoperative\nwhich will lead to various adverse consequences inasmuch as for many\nother purposes as well, PAN Card is used.

Though a sovereign country, its governance is controlled by the\nprovisions of the Constitution which sets parameters within which three\nwings of the State, namely, Legislature, Executive and Judiciary has to\nfunction. Thus, no wing of the State can breach the limitations provided in\nthe Constitution which employs an array of checks and balances to ensure\nopen, accountable government where each wing of the State performs its\nactions for the benefit of the people and within its sphere of responsibility.\nThe checks and balances are many and amongst them are the respective\nroles assigned by the Constitution to the legislature, the executive and the\njudiciary. Under India&#x27;s federal structure, with a distribution of legislative\nauthority between the Union government and the States, the fields of\n\nthe fundamental rights chapter (Part Il) and the chapter relating to inter-\nState trade (Part XIII) also circumscribe the authority of the State: These\nlimitations on the power of the Slate support the notion of &#x27;limited\ngovernment&#x27;. In this sense, the expression &#x27;limited government&#x27; would mean\nthat each wing of the State is restricted by provisions of the Constitution and\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">30 OA.NO.170/00182/2020/CAT/BANGALORE &amp;</span>\nCP.No.170/00141/2019/CAT/BANGALORE\n\nother laws and is required to operate within its legitimate sphere. Exceeding\n\nthese limits would render the action of the State ultra vires the Constitution\nOr a particular law. .\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_104\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"766560\" id=\"span_41\">&#x27;He further argued that the concept of &#x27;limited government&#x27; may also be\nunderstood in a much broader and different sense. This notion of a limited\ngovernment is qua the citizenry as a whole. There are certain things that the\nState simply cannot do, because the action fundamentally alters the\nrelationship between the citizens and the State. The wholesale collection of\n__ biometric data including finger prints and storing it at a central depository per\nse puts the State in an extremely dominant position in relation to the\nindividual citizen. Biometric data belongs to the concerned individual and the\nStale cannot collect or retain it to be used against the individual or to his or\n_ her prejudice in the future. Further the State cannot put itself in a position\nwhere it can track an individual and engage in surveillance. The State\ncannot deprive or withhold the enjoyment of rights and entitlements by an\nindividual or makes such entitlements conditional on a citizen parting with\nher biometrics. Mr. Divan referred to the judgment of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/766560/\" id=\"a_76\">State of\nMadhya Pradesh &amp; Anr. v Thakur Bharat Singh9</a> where the concept of\nlimited government is highlighted in the following manner:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_103\">&quot;9. ...All executive action which operates to the prejudice of any person must\nhave the authority of law to Support it, and the terms of <a href=\"/doc/147929/\" id=\"a_77\">Article 358</a> do not\ndetract from that rule. <a href=\"/doc/147929/\" id=\"a_78\">Article 358</a> expressly authorises the State to take\nlegislative or executive action provided such action was competent for the\nState to make or take, but for the provisions contained in Part II! of the\nConstitution. <a href=\"/doc/147929/\" id=\"a_79\">Article 358</a> does not purport to invest the State with arbitrary\nauthority to take action to the prejudice of citizens and others: jt merely\nprovides that so long as the proclamation of emergency subsists laws may\nbe enacted, and exclusive action may be taken in pursuance of lawful\n_ authority, which if the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_80\">Article 19</a> were operative would have\nbeen invalid. Our federal structure is founded on certain fundamental\nprinciples: (1) the sovereignty of the people with limited Government\nauthority i.e. the Government must be conducted in accordance with the will\n\\ of the majority of the people. The people govern themselves through their\n_ representatives, whereas the official agencies of the executive Government\npossess only such powers as have been conferred upon them by the\npeople; (2) There is a distribution of powers between the three organs of the\nState -- legislative, executive and judicial -- each organ having some check\ndirect or indirect on the other: and (3) the rule of law which includes judicial\nreview of arbitrary executive action.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_104\">As pointed out by Dicey in his Introduction to the study of the Law of the\nConstitution, 10th Edn., at p. 202, the expression &quot;rule of law&quot; has three\nmeanings, or may be regarded from three different points of view. &quot;It means,\n_ In the first place, the absolute supremacy or predominance of regular law as\nopposed to the influence of arbitrary power, and excludes the existence of\n\narbitrariness, of prerogative, or even of wide discretionary authority on the at\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">31 OA.No.170/00182/2020/CAT/BANGALORE &amp;</span>\nCP.No.170/00141/2019/CAT/BANGALORE\n\npart of the 9 AIR 1967 SC 1170: (1967) 2 SCR 454 Government&#x27; At p. 188\nDicey points out:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_105\">&quot;In almost every continental community the executive exercises far wider\ndiscretionary authority in the matter of arrest, of temporary imprisonment, of\nexpulsion from its territory, and the like, than is either legally claimed or in\nfact exerted by the Government in England: and a study of European politics\nnow and again reminds English readers that wherever there is discretion\nthere is room for arbitrariness, and that in a republic no less than under a\nmonarchy discretionary authority on the part of the Government must mean\ninsecurity for legal freedom on the part of its subjects.&quot; We have adopted\nunder our Constitution not the continental system but the British system\nunder which the rule of law prevails. Every Act done by the Government or\nby its officers must, if it is to operate to the prejudice of any person must, be\nsupported by some legislative authority.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_105\">36) Relying on the aforesaid observations, Mr. Divan submitted that the\nrecognition of the distinction between an individual or person and the State\nis the single most important factor that distinguishes a totalitarian State from\none that respects individuals and recognizes their special identity and\nentitlement to dignity. The Indian Constitution does not establish a\ntotalitarian State but creates a State that is respectful of individual liberty\n\nand constitutionally guaranteed freedoms. The Constitution of India is not a\ncharter of servitude.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_106\">37) Proceeding further, another submission of Mr. Divan, as noted above,\nwas that <a href=\"/doc/190513775/\" id=\"a_81\">Section 139AA</a> which coerces the individuals to part with their\npersonal information was unconstitutional He submitted that a citizen is\nentitled to enjoy all these rights including social and civil rights such as the\nright to receive an education, a Scholarship, medical assistance, pensions\nand benefits under government schemes without having to part with his or\nher personal biometrics. An individual&#x27;s biometrics such as finger prints and\niris scan are the property and entitlement of that individual and the State\ncannot coerce an individual or direct him or her to part with biometrics as a\ncondition for the exercise of rights or the enjoyment of entitlements. Every\ncitizen has a basic right to informational self-determination and the state\ncannot exercise dominion over a citizen&#x27;s proprietary information either in\nindividual cases or collectively so as to place itself in a position where it can\naggregate information and create detailed profiles of individuals or facilitate\nthis process. The Constitution of India is not a charter for a Police State\nwhich permits the State to maintain cradle to grave records of the citizenry.\nNo democratic country in the world has devised a system similar to Aadhaar\nwhich operates like an electronic leash to tether every citizen from cradle to\ngrave. There can be no question of free consent in situations where an\nindividual is being coerced to part with its biometric information (a) to be\neligible for welfare schemes of the State; and/or (b) under the threat of penal\nconsequences. In other words, the State cannot compel a person to part\nwith biometrics as a condition precedent for discharge of the State&#x27;s\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">32 OA.No.170/00182/2020/CAT/BANGALORE &amp;</span>\nCP.No.170/00141/2019/CAT/BANGALORE\n\nconstitutional and statutory obligations. In support of his submission that\nthere cannot be coercive measures on the part of the Government to part\nwith such information and it has to be voluntary and based on informed\nconsent, Mr. Divan refered to the following judgments: oe\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_107\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"195593310\" id=\"span_44\">(<a href=\"/doc/195593310/\" id=\"a_82\">i) National Legal Services Authority v.

Every human being of adult years and sound mind has a right to\ndetermine what shall be done with his own body. In the case. of medical\ntreatment, for example, a surgeon who. performs an operation without the\npatient&#x27;s consent commits assault or battery. It follows as a corollary that the\npatient possesses the right not to consent i.e. to refuse treatment. (In the\nUnited States this right is reinforced by a constitutional right of privacy). This\nis known as the principle of self-determination or informed consent.

The logical corollary of the doctrine of informed consent is that the\n\npatient generally possesses the right not to consent, that is, to refuse\ntreatment.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_114\">38) He, thus, submitted that the right to life covers and extends to a person&#x27;s\nright to protect his or her body and identity from harm.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_115\">The right to life extends to allowing a person to preserve and protect his or\nher finger prints and iris scan. The strongest and most secure manner of a\nperson protecting this facet of his or her bodily integrity and identity is to\nretain and not part with finger prints/iris scan. He argued that the right to life\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_91\">Article 21</a> permits every person to live life to the fullest and to enjoy\nfreedoms guaranteed as fundamental rights, constitutional rights, statutory\nrights and common law rights. He also argued that the constitutional validity\nof a statutory provision must be judged by assessing the effect the\nimpugned provision has on fundamental rights. The effect of the impugned\nprovision is to coerce persons into parting with their finger prints and iris\nscan and lodging these personal and intimate aspects of an individual&#x27;s\nidentity with the State as part of a programme that is in the petitioner&#x27;s view\n\nwholly illegitimate and the validity of which is pending before the Constitution\nBench. :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_110\">39) Expressing his grave fear and misuse of personal information parted\nwith by the citizenry in the form of biometrics i.e. finger prints and iris scan,\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_50\">34 OA.No.170/00182/2020/CAT/BANGALORE &amp;</span>\nCP.No.170/00141/2019/CAT/BANGALORE\n\nMr. Divan made a passionate plea that requirement of enrollment for\nAadhaar is designed to facilitate and encourage private sector operators to\ncreate applications that depend upon the Aadhaar data base for the\npurposes of authentication/verification. This would mean that non-\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_116\">governmental, private sector entities such as banks, employers, any point of\npayment, taxi services, airlines, colleges, schools, movie theatres, clubs,\nservice providers, travel companies, etc. will all utilise the Aadhaar data\nbase and may also insist upon an Aadhaar number or Aadhaar\nauthentication. This would mean that at every stage in an individual&#x27;s daily\nactivity his or her presence could be traced to a location in real time. One of\nthe purposes of Aadhaar as projected by the respondents is that it will be a\nsingle point verification for KYC (Know Your Customer). This is permissible\nand indeed contemplated by the impugned Act. Given the very poor quality\nof scrutiny of documents by private enrollers and enrollment agencies\n(without any governmental supervision) means that the more rigorous KYC\nprocess at present being employed by banks and other financial institutions\nwill yield to a system which depends on a much weaker data base. This\nwould eventually imperil the integrity of the financial system and also\nthreaten the economic sovereignty of the nation. According to him, Aadhaar\nAct does not serve as an identity as incorrectly projected by the respondents\nbut serves as a method of identification. Every citizen-state and citizen-\nservice provider interaction requiring identification is sought to be captured\nand retained by the government at a central base and a whole ecology\ndeveloped that would require reference to this central data base on multiple\noccasions in course of the day. He argued that this exercise of enrollment\nimpermissibly creates the foundation for real time, continuous and pervasive\n\nidentification of citizens in breach of the freedoms guaranteed under the\nConstitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_117\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"337342\" id=\"span_51\">40) Another submission of Mr. Divan was. that object behind <a href=\"/doc/190513775/\" id=\"a_92\">Section\n139AA</a> of the Act was clearly discriminatory inasmuch as it creates two\nclasses: one class of those persons. who volunteer to enrol themselves\nunder Aadhaar Scheme and provide the particulars in their income-tax\nreturns and second category of those who refuse to do so. This provision by\nlaying down adverse consequences for those who do not enrol becomes\ndiscriminatory qua that class and, therefore, is violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_93\">Article 14</a> of the\nConstitution. Another limb of his submission was that it also creates an\nartificial class of those who object to such a provision of enrollment under\nAadhaar. According to him, this would be violative of equality clause\nenshrined in <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_94\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution and in support of this submission,\nhe-relied upon the judgment of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/337342/\" id=\"a_95\">Nagpur Improvement Trust &amp;\nAnr. v.

This is because Aadhaar by its very\ndesign and by its statute is &quot;voluntary&quot; and creates a right in favour of a\nresident without imposing any duty. There is no compulsion under the\nAadhaar Act to enroll or obtain a number. If a person chooses not to enroll,\nat the highest, in terms of the Aadhaar Act, he or she may be denied access\nto certain benefits and services funded through the Consolidated Fund of\nIndia. When the Aadhaar enrollment procedure is supposedly based on\ninformed free consent and is voluntary a person cannot be compelled by\nanother law to waive free consent so as to alter the voluntary nature of\nenrollment that is engrafted in the parent statute. The right of a resident\nunder the parent Act cannot be converted into a duty so long as the\nprovisions of the Aadhaar Act cannot be converted into a duty so long as the\nprovisions of the Aadhaar Act remain as they are. Argument was\nthat <a href=\"/doc/190513775/\" id=\"a_99\">Section 139AA</a> be read down to hold that it is only voluntary provision\nby taking out the sting of mandatoriness contained therein and there is no\ncompulsion on any person to give Aadhaar number.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_119\">43) We may mention at this stage itself that on conclusion of his arguments,\nMr. Divan was put a specific query that most of the arguments presented by\nhim endeavoured to project aesthetics of law and jurisprudence which had\nthe shades of &#x27;Right to Privacy&#x27; jurisprudence which could not be gone into\nby this Bench as this very aspect was already referred to the Constitution\n\nBench. Mr. Divan was candid in accepting this fact and his submission was -\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_120\">that in these circumstances, the option for this Bench was to stay the\noperation of proviso to sub-section (2) of <a href=\"/doc/190513775/\" id=\"a_100\">Section 139AA</a> of the Act till the\ndecision is rendered by the Constitution Bench. .\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_121\">44) Mr. Salman.

He submitted that although dignity inevitably includes\nprivacy, the former has several other dimensions which need to be explored\nas well. In his submissions, the test to identify whether certain data collected\n\nabout individuals is intrusive or.merely expansive is to consider whether it\ncauses embarrassment, indignity or invasion of privacy. Thus, the concept\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_122\">- of dignity is quite distinct from that. of privacy. Privacy is a conditional\n\nconcept. One has it only to the extent that one&#x27;s circumstances allow for it,\nas a matter of fact and law. While it is widely accepted that a situation may\n\noccur where a person may not have any Right to Privacy whatsoever,\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_54\">37 OA.No.170/00182/2020/CAT/BANGALORE &amp;</span>\nCP. No.170/00141/2019/CAT/BANGALORE\n\ndignity is an inherent possession of every person, regardless of\ncircumstance. In that sense, Dignity is an inherent dimension of equality, the\nbasis of John Rawls Theory of Justice&#x27;. The Social Contract theory\npropounded by Rousseau remains the ground on which John Rawls\ndeveloped the model of the Original Position in which the contours of the\ncompact are conceived. Anything that reduces the personality of the\nparticipant, such as diluting the human element and substituting it with a\nnumber or biometric data, virtually destroys the model. Dignity is an\nimmutable value, held in equal measure at all times by all people, a quality\nprivacy does not share. No court has ever held that a person can be\n\n&quot;20. ... This Court has in numerous cases deduced fundamental features\nwhich are not specifically mentioned in Part II on the principle that certain\nunarticulated rights are implicit in the enumerated guarantees,\n\nXXX XXX XXX\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_123\">26. It is the duty of the State not only to protect the human dignity but to\nfacilitate it by taking positive .steps in that direction. No exact definition of\n\nEvery human being has dignity by virtue of his existence. The constitutional\ncourts in Germany, therefore, see human dignity as a fundamental principle\nwithin the system of the basic rights. This is how the doctrine of basic\n\nStructure stands evolved under the German Constitution and by\n__ interpretation given to the concept by the constitutional courts.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_124\">card makes an unwarranted intrusion in the importance we give to our bodily\n\nye\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\">38 OA.No.170/00182/2020/CAT/BANGALORE &amp;</span>\nCP.No.170/00141/2019/CAT/BANGALORE\n\nintegrity&#x27; in living our life well. and compels human beings to express\nthemselves the way the State wants. He .also submitted that the features\nrelevant for upholding the dignity of a human being will be severely\ncompromised with when the data are cross-referenced with data relating to\nother spheres of life and are disclosed to third parties through different data\ncollected for varied reasons. This would take place without the knowledge\nand consent of the poor assessees who are apparently required to\n\nmandatory obtain the Aadhaar card only for the purposes of payment of\nfaxes. ; a\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_125\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"845196\" id=\"span_56\">46) Mr. Khurshid also raised doubts and fears about the unauthorised\ndisclosure of the information given by these persons who enroll themselves\nunder Aadhaar and submitted that in the absence of proper mechanism in\nplace to check unauthorised disclosure, the impugned provision of making\nAadhaar card for filing tax returns cannot be said to be consistent with the\ndemocratic ideals. Mr. Khurshid also submitted that there was no compelling\nState interests in having such a provision introducing compulsive element\nand depriving from erstwhile voluntary nature. of Aadhaar scheme.\nAccording to him, the &#x27;proportionality of means&#x27; concept is an essential one\nsince integrating data beyond what is really necessary for the stated\npurpose is clearly unconstitutional. He submitted that in light of the decision\nin the case of <a href=\"/doc/845196/\" id=\"a_101\">Gobind v. State of Madhya Pradesh16</a>, which has been the\nposition of this Court since the past forty-two years and has been cited with\napproval often, it is humbly submitted that the State has the onerous burden\nof justifying the impugned mandatory provision.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"845216\" id=\"span_57\">The &#x27;compelling state\ninterest&#x27; justification is only one aspect of 16 (1975) 2 SCC 148 the broader\nstrict scrutiny&#x27; test, which was applied by this Court in <a href=\"/doc/845216/\" id=\"a_102\">Anuj Garg v. Hotel\nAssociation of India17</a>. The other essential facet is to demonstrate &#x27;narrow\ntailoring&#x27;, i.e., that the State must demonstrate that even if a compelling\ninterest exists, it has adopted a method that will infringe in the narrowest\npossible manner upon individual rights. He submitted that neither is there\nany compelling State interest warranting such a harsh mandatory provision,\nnor has it been narrowly tailored to meet the object, if any. .</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_126\">47) In this hue, he also submitted that <a href=\"/doc/190513775/\" id=\"a_103\">Section 139AA</a> of the Act violates the\n&#x27; Rule of Law. Elaborating his argument, he submitted that a legal system\nwhich in general observes the rule of law treats its people as persons, in the\nsense that it attempts to guide their behaviour through affecting the\ncircumstances of their action. It, thus; presupposes that they are rational\nautonomous creatures and attempts to affect their actions and habits by\naffecting their deliberations. ° It Satisfies men&#x27;s craving for reasonable\ncertainty of form as well as substance, and for dignity of process as well as\ndignity of result. On the other hand, when the rule of law is violated, it may\nbe either in the form of leading to uncertainty or it may lead to frustrated and\ndisappointed 17 (2008) 3 SCC 1 expectations. It leads to the first when the\nlaw does not enable people to foresee future developments or to form\ndefinite expectations. It leads to frustrated expectations when the\nappearance of stability and certainty which encourages people to rely and\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_58\">39 OA.No.170/00182/2020/CAT/BANGALORE &amp;</span>\nCP.No.170/00141/2019/CAT/BANGALORE\n\nplan on the basis of the existing law is shattered by retroactive law-making\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_127\">-or by preventing proper law-enforcement, etc. The evils of frustrated\n\nmandatory, still continues to operate.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_128\">operation is not permissible without separate objects for such operations as\n\nlegitimate and reasonable enough with no preventive mechanism in place, is\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_59\">40 OA.No.170/00182/2020/CAT/BANGALORE &amp;</span>\nCP.No.170/00141/2019/CAT/BANGALORE\n\nin itself a violation of the right to life and personal liberty as enshrined under\nthe Constitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_129\">49) Mr. Anando Mukherjee, learned counsel, appeared in Writ Petition (Civil)\nNo. 304 of 2017, while reiterating the submissions of earlier counsel, argued\nthat <a href=\"/doc/190513775/\" id=\"a_104\">Section 139AA</a> was confused, self-destructive and self-defeating\nprovision for the reason that on the one hand, it had an effect of making\nenrollment into Aadhaar mandatory, but, on the other hand, by virtue of the\nexplanation contained in the provision itself, it is kept voluntary and as a\nmatter of right for the same set of individuals and for the purposes of <a href=\"/doc/190513775/\" id=\"a_105\">Section\n139AA</a>. He also submitted that there was a conflict between <a href=\"/doc/190513775/\" id=\"a_106\">Section\n139AA</a> of the Act and Section 29 of Aadhaar Act inasmuch as <a href=\"/doc/176471/\" id=\"a_107\">Section\n29</a> puts a blanket embargo on using the core biometric information, collected\nor created under the Aadhaar Act for any purpose other than generation of\nAadhaar numbers and authentication under the Aadhaar Act. Mr. Mukherjee\nwent to the extent of describing the impugned provision as-colourable\nexercise of power primarily on the ground that when Aadhaar Act is\nvoluntary in nature, there was no question of making this very provision\nmandatory by virtue of <a href=\"/doc/190513775/\" id=\"a_108\">Section 139AA</a> of the Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_130\">50) Appearing for Union of India, Mr. Mukul Rohatgi, learned Attorney\nGeneral for India, put stiff resistance to the submissions advanced on behalf\nof the petitioners. In a bid to torpedo and pulverise the arguments as set\n\nforth on the side of the petitioners, the leamed Attorney pyramid his\narguments in the following style:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_118\">In the first, Mr. Rohatgi made few preliminary remarks. First such\nsubmission was that many contentions advanced by the counsel for the\npetitioners touch upon the question of Right to Privacy which had already\nbeen referred to the Constitution Bench and, therefore, those aspects were\nnot required to be dealt with. In this behalf he specifically referred to the\nfollowing observations of this Court in its order dated August 11, 2015,\n\nwhich were made by the three Judge Bench in Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_119\">-- Of 2072: . .\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_120\">&#x27;At the same time, we are also of the opinion that the institutional integrity\nand judicial discipline require that pronouncement made by larger Benches\nof this Court cannot be ignored by the smaller Benches without appropriately\n\nexplaining the reasons for not following the pronouncements made by such\nlarger Benches.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_121\">With due respect to all. the learned Judges who rendered the subsequent\njudgments -- where right to privacy is asserted or referred to their Lordships\nconcern for the liberty of human beings, we are of the humble opinion that\nthere appears to be certain amount of apparent unresolved contradiction in\nthe law declared by this Court.&quot; Notwithstanding these preliminary remarks,\nhe rebutted the said argument based on <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_109\">Article 21</a>, including Right to\n\nPrivacy, by raising a plea that Right to Privacy/Personal Autonomy/Bodily\n_ Integrity is not absolute. He referred to the judgment of the United States\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_60\">41 OA.No.170/00182/2020/CAT/BANGALORE &amp;</span>\nCP.No.170/00141/2019/CAT/BANGALORE\n\nSupreme Court in Roe v.

Plantation Private Limited &amp; Anr. v.

While dealing with constitutional validity of a taxation law enacted by\n\nParliament or State Legislature, the court must have regard to the following\nprinciples:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_125\">(i) there is always presumption in favour of constitutionality of a law made by\nParliament or a State Legislature,\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_126\">(ii) no enactment can be struck down by just saying that it is arbitrary or\nunreasonable or irrational but some constitutional infirmity has to be found,\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_127\">(iii) the court is not concerned with the wisdom or unwisdom, the justice or\ninjustice of the law as Parliament and State Legislatures are Supposed to be\n\nMeo\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_63\">42 OA.No.170/00182/2020/CAT/BANGALORE &amp;</span>\nCP.No.170/00141/2019/CAT/BANGALORE\n\nalive to the needs of the people whom they represent and they are the best\n\njudge of the community by 21 (2011) 4 SCC 414 22 (2012) 6 SCC 312\nwhose suffrage they come into existence,\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_128\">(iv) hardship is not relevant in pronouncing on the constitutional validity of a\nfiscal statute or economic law, and\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_129\">(v) in the field of taxation, the legislature enjoys greater latitude for\nclassification...&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_135\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"586923\" id=\"span_64\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1743364\" id=\"span_65\">54) In this hue, he also argued that the State enjoys the widest latitude\nwhere measure of economic regulations are concerned {See -- <a href=\"/doc/1743364/\" id=\"a_118\">Secretary to\nGovernment of Madras &amp; Anr. v. P.R. Sriramulu &amp; Anr.23</a>, paragraph 15)\nand that mala fides cannot be attributed to the Parliament, as held in <a href=\"/doc/586923/\" id=\"a_119\">G.C.\nKanungo v. State of Orissa24</a>, (paragraph 11). Also, the courts approached\n&#x27;the issue with the presumption of constitutionality in mind and.</span></span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"93885\" id=\"span_66\">that\nLegislature intends and correctly appreciates the need of its own people, as\nheld in <a href=\"/doc/93885/\" id=\"a_120\">Mohd. Hanif Quareshi &amp; Ors. v. State of Bihar25</a> (paragraph 15).</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_136\">55) On merits, the argument of Mr. Rohatgi was that once the aforesaid\nbasic parameters are kept in mind, the impugned provision passes the\n_ muster of constitutionality. Adverting to the issue of legislative competence,\nhe referred to <a href=\"/doc/77052/\" id=\"a_121\">Article 246</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1270258/\" id=\"a_122\">248</a> of the Constitution as well as Entry 82 and\nEntry 97 of List-l of Schedule-VIl of the Constitution which empowers the 23\n(1996) 1 SCC 345 24 (1995) 5 SCC 96 25 AIR 1958 SC 731 Parliament to\nlegislate on the subject pertaining to income-tax.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_137\">Therefore, it could not be said that the impugned provision made was\nbeyond the competence of the Parliament. He also submitted that in any\ncase residuary power lies with the Parliament and this power to legislate is\nplenary, as held in Synthetics and Chemicals Ltd. &amp; Ors. v. State of U.P. &amp;\n_Ors.26 &quot;56. On behalf of the State both Mr. Trivedi and Mr Yogeshwar\nPrasad contended that regulatory power of the State was there and in order\nto regulate it was possible to impose certain disincentives in the form of fees\nor levies. Imposition of these imposts as part of regulatory process is\npermissible, it was submitted. Our attention was drawn to the various\ndecisions where by virtue of &quot;police power&#x27; in respect of alcohol the State\n_ has imposed such impositions. Though one would not be justified in\nadverting to any police power, it is possible to conceive sovereign power\nand on that sovereign power to have the power of regulation to impose such\n_ conditions so as to ensure that the regulations are obeyed and complied\nwith. We would not like, however, to embark upon any theory of police\npower because the Indian Constitution does not recognise police power as\nsuch, But we must recognise the exercise of sovereign power which gives\nthe States sufficient authority to enact any law subject to the limitations of\nthe Constitution to discharge its functions. Hence, the Indian Constitution as\na sovereign State has power to legislate on all branches except to the\nlimitation as to the division of powers between the Centre and the States\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_67\">43 OA.No.170/00182/2020/CAT/BANGALORE &amp;</span>\nCP.No.170/00141/2019/CAT/BANGALORE\n\nand also subject to the fundamental _ rights guaranteed under the\nConstitution. The Indian State, between the Centre and the States, has\nsovereign power. The sovereign power is plenary and inherent in every\nSovereign State to do all things which promote the health, peace, morals,\neducation and good order of the people. Sovereignty is difficult to define.\nThis power of sovereignty is, however, subject to constitutional limitations.\nThis power, according to some 26 (1990) 1 SCC 109 constitutional .\nauthorities, is to the public what necessity is to the individual. Right to tax or\nlevy imposts must be in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution,&quot;\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_130\">56) Rebutting the argument of Mr. Datar that by making the impugned\nprovision mandatory the Legislature had acted contrary to the judgments of\nthis Court, Mr. Rohatgi argued that this argument was devoid of any merit on\nvarious counts: First, there was no judgment of this Court and the orders\nreferred were only interim orders. Secondly, in any case, those orders were\npassed at a time when Aadhaar was being implemented as a scheme in\nadministrative/executive domain and the Court was considering the validity\nof Aadhaar scheme in that hue/background. Those orders have not been\npassed in the context of examining the validity of any legislative measure.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_138\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"67472553\" id=\"span_68\">Thirdly, no final view is taken in the form of any judgment that Aadhaar is\nunconstitutional and, therefore, there is no basis in existence which was\nrequired to be removed. Fourthly, the Parliament was competent to pass the\n~ law and provide Statutory framework to give legislative backing to Aadhaar\nin the absence of any such law which existed at that time. He, thus,\nsubmitted that there was no question of curing the alleged basis of\njudgment/interim orders by legislation. He Specifically relied upon the\n\nfollowing passage from the judgment in the case of <a href=\"/doc/67472553/\" id=\"a_123\">Goa Foundation &amp; Anr.\nV. State of Goa &amp; Anr.27</a>: a\n\n&quot;24. The principles on which first question would require to be answered are\nnot in doubt. The power to invalidate a legislative or executive act lies with\nthe Court. A judicial pronouncement, either declaratory or conferring rights\non the citizens cannot be set at naught by a subsequent legislative act for\nthat would amount to an encroachment on the judicial powers. However, the\nlegislature would be competent to pass an amending or a validating act, if\ndeemed fit, with retrospective effect removing the basis of the decision of\nthe Court.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"55098\" id=\"span_69\">Even in such a Situation the courts may not approve a\nretrospective deprivation of accrued rights arising from a judgment by\nmeans of a subsequent legislation (<a href=\"/doc/55098/\" id=\"a_124\">Madan Mohan Pathak v. Union of India</a>).\nHowever, where the Court&#x27;s judgment is purely declaratory, the courts will\nlean in support of the legislative power to remove the basis of a court\njudgment even retrospectively, paving the way for a restoration of the status\nquo ante. Though the consequence may appear to be an exercise to\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_70\">44 OA.No.170/00182/2020/CAT/BANGALORE &amp;</span>\nCP.No.170/00141/2019/CAT/BANGALORE\n\nThe balancing act, delicate as it is, to the constitutional scheme is guided by\nthe well-defined values which have found succinct manifestation in the views\nof this Court in Bakhtawar Trust.&quot; -- .</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_139\">57) Mr. Rohatgi thereafter read extensively from the counter affidavit filed on\nbehalf of the Union of India detailing the rational and objective behind\nintroduction of <a href=\"/doc/190513775/\" id=\"a_125\">Section 139AA</a> of the Act. He submitted that the provision\naims to achieve, inter alia, the following objectives:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_131\">(i) This provision was introduced to tackle the problem of multiple\nPAN cards to same individuals and PAN cards in the name of fictitious\nindividuals are common medium of money laundering, tax evasion, creation\nand channelling of black money. PAN numbers in. name of firm or fictitious\npersons as directors or shareholders are used to create layers of shell\ncompanies through which the aforesaid activities are done. A de-duplication\nexercise was done in the year 2006 and a large number of PAN numbers\nwere found to be duplicate. The problem of some persons fraudulently\nobtaining multiple PANs and using them for making illegal transactions still\nexists. Over all 11.35 lakh cases of duplicate PAN/raudulent PAN have\nbeen detected and accordingly such PANs have been deleted/deactivated.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_140\">Out of this, around 10.52 lakh cases pertain to individual assessees. Total\nnumber of Aadhaar for individuals exceeds 113 crores whereas total number\nof PAN for individuals is around 29 crore. Therefore, whereas the Aadhaar\nAct applies to the entire population, the <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_126\">Income Tax Act</a> applies to a much\nsmaller sub-set of the population, i.e. the tax payers. In order to ensure One\nPan to One Person, Aadhaar can be the sole criterion for allotment of PAN\nto individuals only after all existing PAN are seeded with Aadhaar and\nquoting of Aadhaar is mandated for new PAN applications.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_141\">Counter affidavit filed by the Union of India also gives the following\ninstances of misuse of PAN: _\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_142\">(a) In &#x27;NSDL scame of 2006, about one lakh bogus bank and demat\naccounts were opened through use of PANs. The real PAN owners were not\n\naware of theseaccounts. - .\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_143\">(b) As Banks progressively started insisting on PANs for opening of bank\naccounts, unscrupulous operators managed multiple PANs for providing\n\nentries and operating undisclosed accounts for making _ financial\ntransactions. .\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_144\">(c) Entry operators manage a large number of shell companies using\n\nduplicate PANs or PANs issued in the name of dummy directors and name\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_71\">45 OA.No.170/00182/2020/CAT/BANGALORE &amp;</span>\nCP.No.170/00141/2019/CAT/BANGALORE\n\nlenders. As the persons involved as bogus directors are usually the same\nset of persons, linkage with Aadhaar would prevent such misuse. Further, it\n\nwill also be expedient for the Enforcement agencies to identify and red flag\nsuch misuses in future.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_145\">(d) Cases have also been found where multiple PANs are acquired by a\nsingle entity by dubious means and used for raising loans from different\nbanks. In one such case at Ludhiana, multiple PANs were found acquired by\na person in his individual name as well as in the name of his firms by\ndubious means. During investigation, he admitted to have acquired multiple\nPANSs for raising multiple loans from banks and to avoid adverse CIBIL\ninformation. Prosecution has been launched by the Income Tax Department\nin this case<a href=\"/doc/67522050/\" id=\"a_127\"> u/s 277A</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1989338/\" id=\"a_128\">278</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1417100/\" id=\"a_129\">278B</a> of the Act in addition\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_146\">(ii) To tackle the problem of black money, Mr. Rohatgi pointed out that the\nSecond Report of the Special Investigation Team (SIT) on black money,\nheaded by Justice M.B. Shah (Retd.), after observing the menace of\ncorruption and black money, recommended as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_132\">&quot;At present, for entering into financial/business transactions, persons have\noption to quote their PAN or UID or passport number or driving license or\nany other proof of identity. However, there is no mechanism/system at\n\npresent to connect the data available with each of these independent proofs\nof ID.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_133\">it is suggested that these databases be interconnected. This would assist in\nidentifying multiple transactions by one person with different IDs.&quot; The S| Tin\nits Third Report has recommended the establishment of a Central KYC\nRegistry. The rational for the SIT recommendations was to prove a verifiable\nand authenticable identity for all individuals and Aadhaar provides a\n\nmechanism to serve that purpose in a federated architecture without\naggregating all the information at one place. /\n\nThe Committee headed by the Chairman, CBDT on &#x27;Measures to tackle\nblack money in India and abroad&#x27; reveals that various authorities are dealing\nwith the menace of money laundering being done to evade taxes under the\ngarb of shell companies by the persons who hold multiple bogus PAN\nnumbers under different names or variations of their names, providing\naccommodation entries to various companies and persons to evade taxes\nand introduce undisclosed and unaccounted income of those persons into\n_ their companies as share applications or loans and advances or booking\n\nfake expenses.

The uniqueness of\nPAN is achieved by conducting a de-duplication check on all already\nexisting allotted PAN against the data furnished by new applicant. Under the\nexisting system of PAN only demographic data is captured. De-duplication\nprocess is carried out using a Phonetic Algorithm whereby a Phonetic PAN\n(PPAN) is created in respect of each applicant using the data of applicant&#x27;s\nname, father&#x27;s name, date of birth, gender and status. By comparison of\nnewly generated PPAN with existing set of PPANs of alf assessees\nduplicate check is carried out and it is ensured that same person does not\nacquire multiple PANs or one PAN is not allotted to multiple persons. Due to\nprevalence of common names and large number of PAN holders, the\ndemographic way of de-duplication is not foolproof. Many instances are\nfound where multiple PANs have been allotted to one person or one PAN\nhas been allotted to multiple persons despite the application of above-\nmentioned de-duplication Process. While allotment of multiple PAN to one\nperson has the risk of diversion of income of person into several PANs\nresulting in evasion of tax, the allotment of same PAN to multiple persons\n\nresults in wrong aggregation and assessment of incomes of several persons\nas one taxable entity represented by single PAN.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_153\">(d) Presently verification of original documents in only 0.2% cases (200 out\nof 1,00,000 PAN applications) is done on a random basis which is quite less.\nIn the case of Aadhaar, 100% verification is possible due to availability of\non-line Aadhaar authentication service provided by the UIDAI Aadhaar\nseeding in PAN database will make PAN allotment process more robust\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_154\">(e) Seeding of Aadhaar number into PAN database will allow a robust way\nof de-duplication as Aadhaar number is de-duplicated using biometric\nattributes of fingerprints and iris images.

His submissions in this behalf were that proportionality\nshould not be read into <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_133\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution and in any case no\nproportionality or other 31 (201 0) 5 SCC 318 32 Writ Petition (C) No. 607 of\n2016 decided on February 06, 2017 <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_134\">Article 14</a> violation had been made out\nin the instant case. He also argued that there is no absolute right to\ninformational self-determination; to the extent such right may exist it is part\n\nof the Right to Privacy whose very existence contours is before the\nConstitution Bench of this Court.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_151\">68) Adverting to the doctrine of proportionality, he referred to the judgments\nof this Court in Modern Dental College and Research Centre33 wherein this\ndoctrine is explained and applied and submitted that the doctrine is applied\nonly in the context of <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_135\">Article 19(1)(g)</a> and not <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_136\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_157\">He pointed out that proportionality is not the governing law even in the\nUnited Kingdom for claims analogous to <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_137\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution.. His\npassionate submission was that proportionality supplanting traditional review\nin European Court of Human Rights cases and not remaining applicable in\ntraditional judicial review claims has caused immense confusion in British\npubic law. Narrating the structure of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_138\">Article 19</a>, submission of Mr. Sengupta\nwas that freedoms which were enlisted under <a href=\"/doc/1142233/\" id=\"a_139\">Article 19(1)</a> were not the\nabsolute freedoms and they were subject to reasonable restrictions, as\nprovided under sub-article (2) to (6) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_140\">Article 19</a> itself. It is because of this\nreason, while examining as to whether 33 Footnote 7 above a particular\nmeasure violated any of the freedoms or WaS a reasonable restriction,\nbalancing exercise was to be done by the courts and this balancing exercise\n\nbrings the element of proportionality. However, this was not envisaged\nin <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_141\">Article 14</a> at all.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_158\">69) Coming to the impugned provision and referring to the penal\nconsequences provided in proviso to <a href=\"/doc/178877346/\" id=\"a_142\">Section 139AA(2)</a>, he argued that the\ntest of whether penalty is proportionate is not the same as the doctrine of\nproportionality. Proportionate penalty is an incident of arbitrariness whereas\nthere cannot be any arbitrariness qua a Statute. He also submitted that on\nfacts penalty provided in the impugned provision is deemed to be the same\nas that for not filing income tax return with valid PAN. He also argued that\nthere was no violation of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_143\">Article 14</a> inasmuch as classification had a\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_78\">50 OA.No.170/00182/2020/CAT/BANGALORE &amp;</span>\nCP.No.170/00141/2019/CAT/BANGALORE\n\nreasonable nexus with the object enshrined in the impugned provision. It\nwas open to the Legislature to determine decrease of harm and act\naccordingly and the Legislature does not have to tackle problem 100% for it\nto have a rational nexus. Since individual assessees are prone to the\nproblem and financial frauds using fake PAN, whether individually or in the\nguise of legal persons, Aadhaar aims at tackling problem which exhibited a\nrational nexus with the object. According to Mr. Sengupta, there was no\ndiscriminatory object inasmuch as the object is to weed out duplicate PANs\n\nthat allow financial and tax fraud. Therefore, the provision is not\ndiscriminatory in nature. |\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_159\">70) Dealing with the argument of right to informational se/f-determination,\nthe learned counsel submitted that as a matter of current practice in India,\nno absolute right to determine what information about oneself one wants to\ndisclose; several pieces of personal information are required by law. The\n_ perils of comparative law in merely transplanting from German-law; the need\nto develop an Indian understanding of privacy and self-determination in the\nIndian context. Even in German law,. the judgment quoted by the petitioner\ndoes not demonstrate an untrammelled Right to Privacy or information self-\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_160\">-determination. The world over, information over oneself is the most critical\n\nelement of privacy; the contours of which are to be determined by a\nConstitution Bench. . .\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_161\">A Caveat\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_162\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"547362\" id=\"span_79\">71) Before we enter into the discussion and weigh the merits of arguments\naddressed on both sides, one aspect needs to be made absolutely clear,\nthough it has been hinted earlier as well. Conscious of the fact that\nchallenge to Aadhaar scheme/legislation on the ground that it was violative\nof <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_144\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution is pending before the Constitution Bench\nand, therefore, this Bench could not have decided that issue, counsel for the\npetitioners had submitted that they would not be pressing the issue of Right\nto Privacy. Notwithstanding the same, it was argued by Mr. Divan, though in\nthe process Mr. Divan emphasised that he was touching upon other facets\nof <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_145\">Article 21.</a> Likewise, Mr. Salman Khurshid while arguing that the\n&#x27;impugned provision was violative of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_146\">Article 21</a>, based his submission on\nRight to Human Dignity as a facet of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_147\">Article 21</a>, He also emphasised that the\nconcept of human dignity was different from Right to Privacy. We have taken\nnote of these arguments above. However, we feel all these aspects argued\nby the petitioners overlap with privacy issues as different aspects of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_148\">Article --\n21</a> of the Constitution. Right to Let Alone has the shades of Right to Privacy\n\nand it is so held by the Court in <a href=\"/doc/547362/\" id=\"a_149\">R. Rajagopal &amp; Anr. v. State of Tamil Nadu\n&amp; Ors.</a> 34: : . - .</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_152\">&quot;26. We may now summarise the broad principles flowing from the above\ndiscussion: | --_\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_80\">51 OA.No.170/00182/2020/CAT/BANGALORE &amp;</span>\nCP.No.170/00141/2019/CAT/BANGALORE\n\n(1) The right to privacy is implicit in the right to life and liberty guaranteed to\nthe citizens of this country by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_150\">Article 21.</a> It is a &quot;tight to be let alone&#x27;. A\ncitizen has a right to safeguard the privacy of his own, his family, 34 (1994)\n6 SCC 632 marriage, procreation, motherhood, child-bearing and education\namong other matters. None can publish anything concerning the above\nmatters without his consent -- whether truthful or otherwise and whether\nlaudatory or critical. If he does so, he would be violating the right to privacy\nof the person concerned and would be liable in an action for damages.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_163\">Position may, however, be different, if a person voluntarily thrusts himself\ninto controversy or voluntarily invites or raises a controversy.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_164\">(2) The rule aforesaid is subject to the exception, that any publication\nconcerning the aforesaid aspects becomes unobjectionable if such\npublication is based upon public records including court records. This is for\nthe reason that once a matter becomes a matter of public record, the right to\nprivacy no longer subsists and it becomes a legitimate subject for comment\nby press and media among others. We are, however, of the opinion that in\nthe interests of decency [<a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_151\">Article 19(2)]</a> an exception must be carved out to\nthis rule, viz., a female who js the victim of a sexual assault, kidnap,\nabduction or a like offence should not further be subjected to the indignity of\nher name and the incident being publicised in press/media. (3) There is yet\nanother exception to the rule in (1) above -- indeed, this is not an exception\nbut an independent rule. In the case of public officials, it is obvious, right to\nprivacy, or for that matter, the remedy of action for damages is simply not\navailable with respect to their acts and conduct relevant to the discharge of\ntheir official duties. This is so even where the publication is based upon facts\nand statements which are not true, unless the Official establishes that the\npublication was made (by the defendant) with reckless disregard for truth. In\nsuch a case, it would be enough for the defendant (member of the press or\nmedia) to prove that he acted after a reasonable verification of the facts; it is\nnot necessary for him to prove that what he has written is true. Of course,\nwhere the publication is proved to be false and actuated by malice or\npersonal animosity, the defendant would have no defence and would be\nliable for damages. It is equally obvious that in matters not relevant to the\ndischarge of his duties, the public official enjoys the same protection as any\nother citizen, as explained in (1) and (2) above. It needs no reiteration that\n\njudiciary, which is protected by the power to punish for contempt of court\nand Parliament and legislatures protected as their privileges are by <a href=\"/doc/1251904/\" id=\"a_152\">Articles\n\n105</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1085458/\" id=\"a_153\">104</a> respectively of the Constitution of India, represent exceptions\nto this rule. .\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_165\">(4) So far as the Government, local authority and other organs and\ninstitutions exercising governmental power are concerned, they cannot\nmaintain a suit for damages for defaming them\n\n(5) Rules 3 and 4 do not, however, mean that <a href=\"/doc/61492784/\" id=\"a_154\">Official Secrets Act, 1923</a>, or\nany similar enactment or provision having the force of law does not bind the\n\npress or media. --\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_81\">520 OA.No.170/00182/2020/CAT/BANGALORE &amp;</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_166\">CP.No.170/00141/2019/CAT/BANGALORE\n\n(6) There is no law empowering the State or its officials to prohibit, or to\n_ impose a prior restraint upon the press/media.&quot; So is the Right to\n_ Informational Self Determination, as Specifically spelled out by US Supreme\n~ Court in United States Department of Justice. v. Reporters Committee for\nFreedom of the Press35. Because of the aforesaid reasons and keeping in\nmind the principle of judicial discipline, we have made conscious choice not\nto deal with these aspects and it would be for the parties to raise these\nissues before the Constitution Bench. Accordingly, other arguments based\non <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_155\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_156\">19</a> of the Constitution as well as competence of the\nlegislature to enact such law are being examined.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_167\">72) We have deeply deliberated on the arguments advanced by various\ncounsel appearing for different petitioners as well as counter submissions\nmade by counsel appearing on behalf of the State. Undoubtedly, the issue\nthat confronts us is of seminal importance. In recent times, issues about the\nproprietary, significance, merits and demerits have generated lots of debate\namong intelligentia. The Government claims that this provision is introduced\nin the Statute to achieve laudable objectives and it is in public interest. It is\nfelt that this technology can solve many development challenges. The\npetitioners argue that the move is impermissible as it violates their\nfundamental rights. It falls in the category of, what Ronald Dworkin calls,\n&#x27;hard cases&#x27;. Nevertheless, the duty of the court is to decide such cases as\nwell and give better decision. While undertaking this exercise of judicial\nreview, let us first keep in mind the width and extent of power of judicial\nreview of a legislative action. The Court cannot question the wisdom of the\nLegislature in enacting a particular law. It is required to act within the domain\navailable to it. Scope of Judicial Review of Legislative Act\n\n_ 73) Under the Constitution, Supreme Court as well as High Courts are\nvested with the power of judicial review of not only administrative acts of the\nexecutive but legislative enactments passed by the legislature as well. This\n&quot;power is given to the High Courts under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_157\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution and\nto the Supreme Court under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_158\">Article 32</a> as well as <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_159\">Article 136</a> of the\nConstitution. At the same time, the parameters on which the power of\njudicial review of administrative act is to be undertaken are different from the\nparameters on which validity of legislative enactment is to be examined. No\ndoubt, in exercises of its power of judicial review of legislative action, the\nSupreme Court, or for that matter, the High Courts can declare law passed\n_by the Parliament or the State Legislature as invalid. However, the power to\nstrike down primary legislation enacted by the Union or the State\nLegislatures is on limited grounds. Courts can strike down legislation either\non the basis that it falls foul of federal distribution of powers or that it\ncontravenes fundamental rights or other Constitutional rights/provisions of\nthe Constitution of India. No doubt, since the Supreme Court and the High\nCourts are treated as the &#x27;ultimate arbiter in all matters involving - a\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_82\">53 OA.No.170/00182/2020/CAT/BANGALORE &amp;</span>\nCP.No.170/00141/2019/CAT/BANGALORE\n\ninterpretation of the Constitution, it is the Courts which have the final say on\nquestions relating to rights and whether such a right is violated or not.

A legislation passed by Parliament can be challenged only on\nconstitutionally recognised grounds. Ordinarily, grounds of attack of a\nlegislation is whether the legislature has legislative competence or whether\nthe legislation is ultra vires the provisions of the Constitution. If any of the\nprovisions of the legislation violates fundamental rights or any other\nprovisions of the Constitution, it could certainly be a valid ground to set\naside the legislation by invoking the power of judicial review. A legislation\ncould also be challenged as unreasonable if it violates the principles of\nequality adumbrated in our Constitution or it unreasonably restricts the\nfundamental rights under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_180\">Article 19</a> of the Constitution. A legislation cannot\n\nbe challenged simply on the ground of unreasonableness because that by\nitself does not constitute a ground.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_168\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"174974\" id=\"span_96\">The validity of a constitutional amendment and the validity of plenary\nlegislation have to be decided purely as questions of constitutional law. This\nCourt in <a href=\"/doc/174974/\" id=\"a_181\">State of Rajasthan v. Union of India</a> said: (SCC p. 660, para .</span>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_97\">56 OA.No.170/00182/2020/CAT/BANGALORE &amp;</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_169\">CP.No.170/00141/2019/CAT/BANGALORE\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_170\">149) &quot;149. ... if a question brought before the court is purely a political\nquestion not involving determination of any legal or constitutional night or\nobligation, the court would not entertain it, since the court is concerned only\nwith adjudication of legal rights and liabilities.&quot; Therefore, the plea of the\npetitioner that the legislation itself was intended to please a section of the\n&quot;community as part of the vote catching mechanism is 38 (2008) 6 SCC 1\nnot a legally acceptable plea and it is only to be rejected.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_176\">77) Furthermore, it also needs to be specifically noted that this Court\nemphasised that apart from the aforesaid two grounds no third ground is\navailable to invalidate any piece of legislation. In this behalf it would be\napposite to reproduce the following observations from State of A.P. &amp; Ors. Vv,\n\nMcDowell &amp; Co.-&amp; Ors.39, which is a judgment rendered by a three Judge\nBench of this Court:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_171\">&quot;43...A law made by Parliament or the legislature can be struck down by\ncourts on two grounds and two grounds alone, viz., (1) lack of legislative\ncompetence and (2) violation of any of the fundamental rights guaranteed in\nPart Ill of the Constitution or of any other constitutional provision. There is\nno third ground. We do not wish to enter into a discussion of the concepts of\nprocedural unreasonableness. and substantive unreasonableness --\nconcepts inspired by the decisions of United States Supreme Court. Even in\nU.S.A., these concepts and in particular the concept of substantive due\nprocess have proved to be of unending controversy, the latest thinking\ntending towards a severe curtailment of this ground (substantive due\nprocess). The main criticism against the. ground of substantive due process\nbeing that it seeks to set up the courts as arbiters of the wisdom of the\nlegislature in enacting the particular piece of legislation. It is enough for us to\n_ Say that by whatever name it is characterised, the ground of invalidation\nmust fall within the four corners of the two grounds mentioned above. In\nother words, say, if an enactment is challenged as violative of <a href=\"/doc/1627496/\" id=\"a_182\">Article 4 4</a>, it\ncan be struck down only if it is found that it is violative of the equality\nclause/equal protection clause enshrined therein.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_172\">Similarly, if an enactment is challenged as violative of any of the\nfundamental rights guaranteed by clauses 39 (1996) 3 SCC 709 (a) to (g)\nof <a href=\"/doc/1142233/\" id=\"a_183\">Article 19(1)</a>, it can be struck down only if it is found not saved by any of\nthe clauses (2) to (6) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_184\">Article 19</a> and so on. No enactment can be struck\ndown by just saying that. it is arbitrary or unreasonable. Some or other\nconstitutional infirmity has to be found before invalidating an Act. An\nenactment cannot be struck down on the ground that court thinks it\nunjustified. Parliament and the legislatures, composed as they are of the\nrepresentatives of the people, are supposed to know and be aware of the\n_ needs of the people and what is good and bad for them. The court cannot sit\nin judgment over their wisdom. In this connection, it should be remembered\nthat even in the case of administrative action, the scope of judicial review is\nlimited to three grounds, viz., (i) unreasonableness, which can more Uo\nappropriately be called irrationality, (ii) illegality and (iii) procedural a\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_98\">57 OA.No.170/00182/2020/CAT/BANGALORE &amp;</span>\nCP.No.170/00141/2019/CAT/BANGALORE\n\n&quot;64. From the above extract from McDowell &amp; Co, case itis clear that the\n\nbecame a mantra,\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_173\">65. For the above reasons, we are of the opinion that it is not permissible for\nthis Court to declare a Statute unconstitutional on the ground that it is\narbitrary&#x27;.&quot; . :\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_174\">79) Same sentiments were expressed earlier by this Court in K. T,\n\nPlantation Private Limited &amp; Anr.41 in the following words:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_175\">Otherwise the court will be substituting its wisdom to that of the legislature,\nwhich is impermissible in our constitutional democracy.&quot; A fortiorari, a law ue\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_99\">58 OA.No.170/00182/2020/CAT/BANGALORE &amp;</span>\nCP.No.170/00141/2019/CAT/BANGALORE\n\ncannot be invalidated on the ground that the Legislature did not apply its\n\nmind or it was prompted by some 40 (2016) 2 SCC 445 41 Footnote 19\n. above. improper motive. .\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_176\">80) It is, thus, clear that in exercise of power of judicial review, Indian Courts\nare invested with powers to strike down primary legislation enacted by the\nParliament or the State legislatures. However, while undertaking this\nexercise of judicial review, the same is to be done at three levels. In the first\nstage, the Court would examine as to whether impugned provision in a\nlegislation is compatible with the fundamental rights or the Constitutional\nprovisions (substantive judicial review) or it falls foul of the federal\ndistribution of powers (procedural judicial review). If it is not found to be SO,\nno further exercise is needed as challenge would fail. On the other hand, if it\nis found that Legislature lacks competence as the subject legislated was not\nwithin the powers assigned in the list in VII Schedule, no further enquiry is\nneeded and such a law is to be declared as ultravires the Constitution.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_177\">However, while undertaking substantive judicial review, if it is found that the\nimpugned provision appears to be violative of fundamental rights or other\nConstitutional rights, the Court reaches the second stage of review. At this\nsecond phase of enquiry, the Court is Supposed to undertake the exercise\nas to whether the impugned provision can still be saved by reading it down\nSO as to bring it in conformity with the Constitutional provisions. If that is not\n~ achievable then the enquiry enters the third stage. If the offending portion of\nthe statute is severable; it is severed and &#x27;the Court strikes down the\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_178\">- impugned provision declaring the same as unconstitutional.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_179\">81) Keeping in view the aforesaid parameters we, at this stage, we want to\ndevote some time discussing the arguments of the petitioners based on the\n\nconcept of &#x27;limited government&#x27;. Concent of &#x27;Limited Government&#x27; and its\nimpact on powers of Judicial Review .\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_180\">82) There cannot be any dispute about the manner in which Mr. Shyam\nDivan explained the concept of &#x27;limited Government&#x27; in his submissions.\n. Undoubtedly, the Constitution of India, as an instrument of governance of\n_. the State, delineates the functions and powers of each wing of the State,\n_ namely, the Legislature, the Judiciary and the Executive. It also enshrines\nthe principle of separation of powers which mandates that each wing of the\nState has to function within its own domain and no wing of the State is\nentitled to trample over the function assigned to the other wing of the State.\nThis fundamental document of governance also contains principle of\n_ federalism wherein the Union. is assigned certain powers and likewise\n: powers of the State are also prescribed. In this context, the Union\nLegislature, i.e. the Parliament, as well as the State Legislatures are given\nSpecific areas in respect of which they have power to legislate. That is so\nstipulated in Schedule VII of the Constitution wherein List | enumerates the\nsubjects. over which Parliament has the dominion, List II spells out those A\nareas where the State Legislatures have the power to make laws while List ON\nIl is the Concurrent List which is accessible both to the Union as well as the.&quot;\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_100\">59 OA.No.170/00182/2020/CAT/BANGALORE &amp;</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_181\">CP.No.170/00141/2019/CAT/BANGALORE\n\nSlate Governments. The Scheme pertaining to making laws by the\nParliament as well as by the Legislatures of the State is primarily contained\nin <a href=\"/doc/574894/\" id=\"a_185\">Articles 245</a> to 254 of the Constitution. Therefore, it cannot be disputed\nthat each wing of the State to act within the sphere delineated for it under\nthe Constitution. It is correct that crossing these limits would render the\naction of the State ultra vires the Constitution. When it comes to power of\ntaxation, undoubtedly, power to tax is treated as sovereign power of any\nState. However, there are constitutional limitations briefly described above.\nIn a nine Judge Bench decision of this Court in Jindal Stainless Ltd. &amp; Anr.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_182\">v. State of Haryana &amp; Ors. 42 discussion on these constitutional limitations\nare as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_177\">&quot;20. Exercise of sovereign power is, however, subject to Constitutional\nlimitations especially in a federal system like ours where the States also to\nthe extent permissible exercise the power to make laws including laws that\nlevy taxes, duties and fees. That the power to levy taxes is subject to\nconstitutional limitations is no longer res-integra. A Constitution Bench of\nthis Court has in Synthetics and Chemicals Ltd. y. State of U.P. (1990) 1\nSCC 109 recognised that in India the Centre and the States both enjoy the\n\nexercise of sovereign power, to the extent the Constitution confers upon\nthem that power. This Court declared:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_178\">&quot;56... We would not like, however, to embark upon any theory of police\npower because the Indian Constitution does not recognise police power as\nsuch. But we must recognise the exercise of Sovereign power which gives\nthe State sufficient authority to enact any law subject to the limitations of the\nConstitution to discharge its functions. Hence, the Indian Constitution as a\nsovereign State has power to legislate on -all branches except to the\nlimitation as to the division of powers between the Centre and the States\nand also subject to the fundamental rights guaranteed under the\nConstitution. The Indian States, between the Centre and the States, has\nsovereign power. The sovereign power is plenary and inherent in every\nsovereign State to do all things which promote the health, peace, morals,\neducation and good order of the people. Sovereignty is difficult to define.\nThis power of sovereignty is, however, subject to constitutional\nlimitations.&#x27;This power, according to some constitutional authorities, is to the\npublic what necessity is to the individual Right to tax or levy impost must be\nin accordance with the provisions of the Constitution.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_183\">21. What then are the Constitutional limitations on the power of the State\nlegislatures to levy taxes or for that matter enact legislations in the field\nreserved for them under the relevant entries of List Il and III of the Seventh\nSchedule. The first and the foremost of these limitations appears in <a href=\"/doc/134715/\" id=\"a_186\">Article\n13</a> of the Constitution of India which declares that all laws in force in the\nterritory of India immediately before the commencement of the Constitution\nare void to the extent they are inconsistent with the provisions of Part [//\ndealing with the fundamental rights guaranteed to the citizens. It forbids the\n\nStates from making any law which takes away or abridges, any provision of Dea\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_101\">60 | OA.No.170/00182/2020/CAT/BANGALORE &amp;</span>\nCP.No.170/00141/2019/CAT/BANGALORE\n\nPart Ill. Any law made in contravention of the said nights shall to the extent\nof contravention be void. There is no gain saying that the power to enact\nlaws has been conferred upon the Parliament subject to the above\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_184\">- Constitutional limitation. So also in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1270258/\" id=\"a_187\">Article 248</a>, the residuary power\nto impose a tax not otherwise mentioned in the Concurrent List or the State\n_ List has been vested in the Parliament to the exclusion of the State\n\nlegislatures, and the States&#x27; power to levy taxes limited to what is specifically\nreserved in their favour and no more.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_185\">22. <a href=\"/doc/1883579/\" id=\"a_188\">Article 249</a> similarly empowers the Parliament to legislate with respect to\na matter in the State List for national interest provided the Council of States\nhas declared by a resolution supported by not less than two-thirds of the\nmembers present and voting that it is necessary or expedient in national\ninterest to do so. The power is available till such time any resolution remains .\n_ in force in terms of <a href=\"/doc/434146/\" id=\"a_189\">Article 249(2)</a> and the proviso thereunder.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_186\">23. <a href=\"/doc/497125/\" id=\"a_190\">Article 250</a> is yet another provision which empowers the Parliament to\nlegislate with respect to any matter in the State List when. there is a\nproclamation of emergency. In the event of an inconsistency between laws\nmade by Parliament under <a href=\"/doc/1883579/\" id=\"a_191\">Articles 249</a> and <a href=\"/doc/497125/\" id=\"a_192\">250</a>, and laws made by\nlegislature of the States, the law made by Parliament shall, to the extent of\n\nthe inconsistency, prevail over the law made by the State in terms of Article\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_187\">251. / .\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_188\">24.

He\nsubmitted that there are certain things that the States simply cannot do\nbecause the action fundamentally alters the relationship between the\ncitizens and the State. In this hue, he submitted that it was impermissible for\nthe State to undertake the exercise of collection of bio-metric data, including\nfingerprints and storing at a central depository as it puts the State in an\nextremely dominant position in relation to the individual citizens. He also\nsubmitted that it will put the State in a position to target an individual and\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_190\">- engage in surveillance thereby depriving or withholding the enjoyment of his\nrights and entitlements, which is totally impermissible in a country where\ngovernance of the State of founded on the concept of &#x27;limited Government&#x27;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_191\">Again, this concept of limited government is woven around <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_195\">Article 21</a> of the ~\nConstitution. -\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_102\">61 OA.No.170/00182/2020/CAT/BANGALORE &amp;</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_192\">CP.No.170/00141/2019/CAT/BANGALORE\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_193\">84) Undoubtedly, we are in the era of liberalised democracy. In a democratic\nSociety governed by the Constitution, there is a strong trend towards the\nConstitutionalisation of democratic politics, where the actions of democratic\nelected Government are judged in the light of the Constitution. In this\ncontext, judiciary assumes the role of protector of the Constitution and\n\ndemocracy, being the ultimate arbiter in all matters involving the\ninterpretation of the Constitution, .\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_194\">85) Having said so, when it comes to exercising the power of judicial review\nof a legislation, the scope of such a power has to be kept in mind and the\npower is to be exercised within the limited sphere assigned to the judiciary\nto undertake the judicial review. This has already been mentioned above.\nTherefore, unless the petitioner demonstrates that the Parliament, in\nenacting the impugned provision, has exceeded its power prescribed in the\nConstitution or this provision violates any of the provision, the argument\npredicated on &#x27;limited governance&#x27; will not succeed. One of the aforesaid\ningredients needs to be established by the petitioners in order to succeed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_195\">86) Even in the case of Thakur Bharath Singh43 relied upon by Mr. Divan,\nwherein executive order was passed imposing certain restrictions requiring\nthe respondent therein to reside at a particular place as specified in the\norder, which was passed in exercise of powers contained under Section\n3(1)(b) of the M.P. Public Security Act, 1959, the Court struck down and\nquashed the order only after it found that restrictions contained therein were\nunreasonable and violative of fundamental freedom guaranteed\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1024002/\" id=\"a_196\">Article 19(1)(d)</a> and (e) of the Constitution of India.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_196\">87) With this, we proceed to consider the arguments on which vires of the\nimpugned provisions are questioned:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_179\">Argument of Legislative Competence\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_180\">88) It is not denied by the petitioners that having regard to the provisions\nof <a href=\"/doc/77052/\" id=\"a_197\">Article 246</a> of the Constitution and Entries 82 and 97 of List |, the\nParliament has requisite competence to enact the impugned legislation.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_197\">However, the submission of the petitioners was that the impugned legislative\nprovision was made as per which enrolment under Aadhaar had become\nmandatory for the income tax assessees, whereas this Court has passed\nvarious orders repeatedly emphasising that enrolment for Aadhaar card has\nfo be voluntary. On this basis, the argument is that the Legislature lacked\nthe authority to pass a law contrary to the judgments of this Court, without\nremoving the basis of those judgments. It was also argued that even\nAadhaar Act was voluntary in nature and the basis of the judgments of this\n\nCourt could be taken away only by making enrolment under the Aadhaar Act\ncompulsory, which was not done.\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_103\">62 OA.No.170/00182/2020/CAT/BANGALORE &amp;</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_198\">CP.No.170/00141/2019/CAT/BANGALORE\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_199\">89) Before proceeding to discuss this argument, one aspect of the matter\n\nneeds clarification. There was a debate as to whether Aadhaar Act is\nvoluntary or even that Act makes enrolment under Aadhaar mandatory. --\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_200\">_ 90) First thing that is to be kept in mind is that the Aadhaar Act is enacted to\n\nenable the Government to identify individuals for delivery of benefits,\nsubsidies and services under various welfare schemes. This is so\nmentioned in Section 7 of the Aadhaar Act which states that proof of\nAadhaar number is necessary for receipt of such subsidies, benefits and\nservices. At the same time, it cannot be disputed that once a person enrols\n\n&#x27;himself and obtains Aadhaar number as mentioned in Section 3 of the\n\nAadhaar Act, such Aadhaar number can be used for many other purposes.\nIn fact, this Aadhaar number becomes the Unique Identity (UID) -of that\nperson. Having said that, it is clear that there is no provision in Aadhaar Act\nwhich makes enrolment compulsory. May be for the purpose of obtaining\nbenefits, proof of Aadhaar card is necessary as per <a href=\"/doc/1849490/\" id=\"a_198\">Section 7</a> of the Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_201\">Proviso to <a href=\"/doc/1849490/\" id=\"a_199\">Section 7</a> stipulates that if an Aadhaar number is not assigned to\n\nenable an individual, he shall be offered alternate and viable means of\nidentification for delivery of the subsidy, benefit or service. According to the\npetitioners, this proviso, with acknowledges alternate and viable means of\nidentification, and therefore makes Aadhaar optional and voluntary and the\n\nenrolment is not necessary even for the purpose of receiving subsidies,\n\nbenefits and services under various schemes of. the Government. The\nrespondents, however, interpret the proviso differently and there plea is that\nthe words &#x27;if an Aadhaar number is not assigned to an individual&#x27; deal with\nonly that situation where application for Aadhaar has been made but for\ncertain reasons Aadhaar number has not been assigned as it may take\nsome time to give Aadhaar card. Therefore, this proviso is only by way of an\ninterim measure till Aadhaar number is assigned, which is otherwise\ncompulsory for obtaining certain benefits as stated in Section 7 of the\nAadhaar Act. Fact remains that as per the Government and UIDAI itself, the\nrequirement of obtaining Aadhaar number is voluntary. It has been so\n\nclaimed by UIDAI on its website and Clarification to this effect has also been\nissued by UIDAI.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_202\">91) Thus, enrolment under Aadhaar is voluntary. However, it is a moot\nquestion as to whether for obtaining benefits as prescribed under Section 7\nof the Aadhaar Act, it is mandatory to give Aadhaar number or not is a\ndebatable issue which we are not addressing as this very issue is squarely\nraised which is the subject matter of other writ petition filed and pending in\n\n_ this Court. : :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_181\">» 92) On the one hand, enrollment under Aadhaar card is voluntary, however,\n\nfor the purposes of <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_200\">Income Tax Act</a>, <a href=\"/doc/190513775/\" id=\"a_201\">Section 139AA</a> makes it compulsory for\nthe assessees to give Aadhaar number which means insofar as income tax\nassessees are concerned, they have to necessarily enroll themselves under\nthe Aadhaar Act and obtain Aadhaar number which will be their identification\n\nnumber as that has become the requirement under the <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_202\">Income Tax Act</a>. The :\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_104\">63 OA.No.170/00182/2020/CAT/BANGALORE &amp;</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_182\">CP.No.170/00141/2019/CAT/BANGALORE\n\ncontention that since enrollment under Aadhaar Act is voluntary, it cannot be\ncompulsory under the <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_203\">Income Tax Act</a>, cannot be countenanced. As already\nmentioned above, purpose for enrollment under the Aadhaar Act is to avail\nbenefits of various welfare schemes etc. as Stipulated in Section 7 of the\nAadhaar Act. Purpose behind <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_204\">Income Tax Act</a>, on the other hand, is entirely\ndifferent which has already been discussed in detail above. For achieving\nthe said purpose, viz., to curb blackimongy, money laundering and tax\nevasion etc., if the Parliament chooses to make the provision mandatory\nunder the <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_205\">Income Tax Act</a>, the competence of the Parliament cannot be\nquestioned on the ground that it is impermissible only because under\nAadhaar Act, the provision is directory in nature. It is the prerogative of the\nParliament to make a particular provision directory in one statute and\nmandatory/compulsory in other. That by itself cannot be a ground to\nquestion the competence of the legislature. After all, Aadhaar Act is not a\nmother Act. Two laws, i.e., Aadhaar Act, on the one hand, and law in the\nform of Section .139AA of the Income Tax Act, on the other hand, are two\ndifferent stand alone provisions/laws and validity of one cannot be examined\nin the light of provisions of other Acts. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"7087\" id=\"span_105\">In <a href=\"/doc/7087/\" id=\"a_206\">Municipal Corporation of Delhi v.\nShiv Shanker44</a>, if the objects of two statutory provisions are different and\nlanguage of each statute is restricted to its own objects or subject, then they\nare generally intended to run in parallel lines without meeting and there\nwould be no real conflict though apparently it may appear to be so on the\nsurface. We reproduce hereunder the discussion to the aforesaid aspect\ncontained in <a href=\"/doc/7087/\" id=\"a_207\">the said judgment</a>: .</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_183\">&quot;5. ... It is only when a consistent body of law cannot be maintained without\nabrogation of the previous law that the plea of implied repeal should be\nsustained. To determine if a later statutory provision repeals by implication\nan earlier one it is accordingly necessary to closely scrutinise and consider\nthe true meaning and effect both of the earlier and the later statute. Until this\nis done it cannot be satisfactorily ascertained if any fatal inconsistency exists\nbetween them. The meaning, scope and effect of the two statutes, as\ndiscovered on scrutiny, determines the legislative intent as to whether the\nearlier law shall cease or shall only be supplemented. If the objects of the\ntwo statutory provisions are different and the language of each statute is\nrestricted to its own objects or subject, then they are generally intended to\nrun in parallel lines without meeting and there would be no real conflict\nthough apparently it May appear to be so on the surface. Statutes in pari\nmateria although in apparent conflict, should also, so far as reasonably\npossible, be construed to be in harmony with each other and it is only when\nthere is an irreconcilable conflict between the new provision and the prior\nStatute relating to the same subject-matter, that the former, being the later\nexpression of the legislature, may be held to prevail, the prior law yielding to\nthe extent of the conflict. The same rule of irreconcilable repugnancy\ncontrols implied repeal of a general by a special statute. The subsequent\nprovision treating a phase of the same general subject-matter in a more\nminute way may be intended to imply repeal protanto of the repugnant\ngeneral provision with which it cannot reasonably co-exist. When there is no\n\nyen\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_106\">64 OA.No.170/00182/2020/CAT/BANGALORE &amp;</span>\nCP.No.170/00141/2019/CAT/BANGALORE\n\ninconsistency between the general and the special statute the later may well\n\nbe construed as supplementary.&quot; -\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_203\">93) In view of the above, we are not impressed by the contention of the\n\npetitioners that the two enactments are contradictory with each other. A\n\nharmonious reading of the two enactments would clearly suggests that\n\nwhereas enrollment of Aadhaaar is voluntary when it comes to taking\nbenefits of various welfare schemes even if it is presumed that requirement\nof Section 7 of Aadhaar Act that it is necessary to provide Aadhaar number\nto avail the benefits of schemes and services, it is upto a person to avail\nthose benefits or not. On the other hand, purpose behind enacting <a href=\"/doc/190513775/\" id=\"a_208\">Section\n139AA</a> is to check a menace of black money as well as money laundering\nand also to widen the income tax net so as to cover those persons who are\nevading the payment of tax. a Be\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_204\">94) Main emphasis, however. is on the plea that Parliament or any State\n\n, legislature cannot pass a law that overrules a judgment thereby nullifying <a href=\"/doc/7087/\" id=\"a_209\">the\n\nsaid decision</a>, that too without removing the basis of the decision. This\n\nargument appears to be attractive inasmuch as few orders are passed by\n~ this Court in pending writ petitions which are to the effect that the enrollment\n\nof Aadhaar would be voluntary. However, it needs to be kept in mind that the\norders have been passed in the petitions where Aadhaar scheme floated as\nan executive/administrative measure has been challenged. In those cases,\nthe said orders are not passed in a case where the Court was dealing with a\nStatute passed by the Parliament. Further, these are interim orders as the\nCourt was of the opinion that till the matter is decided finally in the context of\nRight to Privacy issue, the implementation of the said Aadhaar scheme\n\n_ would remain voluntary. In fact, the main issue as to whether Aadhaar card\n\nscheme whereby biometric data of an individual is collected violates Right to\nPrivacy and, therefore, is offensive of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_210\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution or not is\n\n_ yet to be decided. In the process, the Constitution Bench is also called upon\n\nto decide as to whether Right to Privacy is a part of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_211\">Article 21</a> of the\nConstitution at all. Therefore, no final decision has been taken. In a situation\n\nlike this, it cannot be said that Parliament is precluded from or it is rendered\n\nincompetent to pass such a law. That apart, the argument of the petitioners\nis that the basis on which the aforesaid orders are passed has to be\nremoved, which is not done. According to the petitioners, it could be done\nonly by making Aadhaar Act compulsory. It is difficult to accept this\n\n_ contention for two reasons: first, when the orders passed by this Court which\n\nare relied upon by the petitioners were passed when Aadhaar Act was not\neven enacted, Secondly, as already discussed in detail above, Aadhaar Act\nand the law contained in <a href=\"/doc/190513775/\" id=\"a_212\">Section 139AA</a> of the Income Tax Act deal with two\ndifferent situations and operate in different fields. This argument of\nlegislature incompetence -- also, therefore, has fails. Whether <a href=\"/doc/190513775/\" id=\"a_213\">Section\n\n139AA</a> of the Act is discriminatory and offends <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_214\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution\nofindia? --- : . .\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_107\">65 OA.No.170/00182/2020/CAT/BANGALORE &amp;</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_205\">CP.No.170/00141/2019/CAT/BANGALORE\n\n<a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_215\">Article 14</a>, which enshrines the principle of equality as a fundamental right\nmandates that the State shall not deny to any person equality before the law\nor the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India. It, thus, gives\nthe right to equal treatment in similar circumstances, both in privileges\nconferred and in the liabilities imposed. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1660451\" id=\"span_108\">In <a href=\"/doc/1660451/\" id=\"a_216\">Sri Srinavasa Theatre &amp; Ors. v.\nGovernment of Tamil Nadu &amp; Ors.45</a>, this Court explained that the two\nexpressions &#x27;equality before law&#x27; and equal protection of law&#x27; do not mean\n\nlaw. Another facet is &quot;the obligation upon the State to bring about, through\nthe machinery of law, a more equal society... For, equality before law can be\npredicated meaningfully only in an equal society...&quot;. The Court further\nobserved that <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_217\">Article 14</a> prescribes equality before law. But the fact remains\nthat all persons are not equal by nature, attainment or circumstances, and,\ntherefore, a mechanical equality before the law may result in injustice.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"4354\" id=\"span_109\">Thus,\n\npersons in spite of difference in circumstances or conditions {See <a href=\"/doc/4354/\" id=\"a_218\">Chiranjit\nLal Chowdhuri v. Union of India &amp; Ors.</a> 46}.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_206\">95) The varying needs of different classes or sections of people require\ndifferential and separate treatment. The Legislature is required to deal with\ndiverse problems arising out of an infinite variety of human relations. It must,\ntherefore, necessarily have the power of making laws to attain particular\nobjects and, for that purpose, of distinguishing, selecting and classifying\npersons and things upon which its laws are to operate. The principle of\nequality of law, thus, means not that the same law should apply to everyone\nbut that a law should deal alike with all in one class; that there should be an\nequality of treatment under equal circumstances. It means &quot;that equals\n\nshould not be treated unlike and unlikes should not be treated alike. Likes\nshould be treated alike.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_207\">96) What follows is that <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_219\">Article 14</a> forbids class legislation; it does not forbid\nreasonable classification of persons, objects and transactions by the\n\nLegislature for the purpose of achieving specific ends. Classification to be\nreasonable should fulfil the following two tests: .\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_208\">(1) It should not be arbitrary, artificial or evasive. [It should be based on an\nintelligible differentia, some real and substantial] distinction, which\n\ndistinguishes persons or things grouped together in the class from others left\nout of it.\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_110\">66 OA.No.170/00182/2020/CAT/BANGALORE &amp;</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_209\">CP.No.170/00141/2019/CAT/BANGALORE\n\n(2) The differentia adopted as the basis of classification must have a rational\n\nor reasonable nexus with the object sought to be achieved by the statute in\nquestion.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_210\">Thus, <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_220\">Article 14</a> in its ambit and Sweep involves two facets, viz., it permits\nreasonable classification which is founded on intelligible differentia and\naccommodates the practical needs of the society and the differential must\nhave a rational relation to the objects sought to be achieved. Further, it does\nnot allow any kind of arbitrariness and ensures fairness and equality of\ntreatment. It is the fonjuris of our Constitution, the fountainhead of justice.\nDifferential treatment does not per se amount to violation of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_221\">Article 14</a> of the\nConstitution and it violates <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_222\">Article 14</a> only when there is no reasonable basis\nand there. are several tests to decide whether a classification is reasonable\n\nor not and one of the tests will be as to whether it is conducive to the\nfunctioning of modern society.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_211\">97) Insofar as the impugned provision is concerned, Mr. Datar had\nconceded that first test that of reasonable classification had been satisfied\nas he conceded that individual assesses form a separate class and the\nimpugned provision which targeted only individual assesses would not be\n\ndiscriminatory on this ground. His whole Writ Petition (Civil) No. 247 of 2017\n\n&amp; Ors. Page 114 oe\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_111\">67 OA.No.170/00182/2020/CAT/BANGALORE &amp;</span>\nCP.No.170/00141/2019/CAT/BANGALORE\n\nemphasis was that <a href=\"/doc/190513775/\" id=\"a_223\">Section 139AA</a> did not satisfy the second limb of the\n\ntwin tests of classification as, according to him, this provision had no rational\nnexus with the object sought to be achieved.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_212\">98) In this behalf, his submission was that if the purpose of the provision\nwas to curb circulation of black money, such an object was not achievable\nby seeing PAN with Aadhaar inasmuch as Aadhaar is only for individuals.\nHis submission was that it is only the individuals who are responsible for\ngenerating black money or money laundering. This was the basis for Mr.\n\nDatar&#x27;s submission. We find it somewhat difficult to accept such a\nsubmission.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_213\">99) Unearthing black money or checking money laundering is to be\nachieved to whatever extent possible. Various measures can be faken in\nthis behalf. If one of the measures is introduction of Aadhaar into the tax\n\nwould not be achieved fully. Such kind of menace, which is deep rooted,\nneeds to be tackled by taking multiple actions and those actions may be\ninitiated at the same time. It is the combined effect of these actions which\nmay yield results and each individual action considered in isolation may not\nbe sufficient. Therefore, rationality of a particular measure cannot be.\nchallenged on the ground that it has no nexus with the objective to be\nachieved. Of course, there is a definite objective. For this purpose alone,\nindividual measure cannot be ridiculed. We have already taken note of the\nrecommendations of SIT on black money headed by Justice M.B. Shah. We\nhave also reproduced the measures suggested by the committee headed by\nChairman, CBDT on &#x27;Measures to tackle black money in India and Abroad&#x27;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_214\">identity of a person for entering into finance/business transactions etc may\ngo a long way in curbing this foul practice. That apart, even if solitary\npurpose of de-duplication of PAN cards is taken into consideration, that may\nbe sufficient to meet the second test of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_224\">Article 14.</a> It has come on record that\n11.35 lakhs cases of duplicate PAN or fraudulent PAN cards have already\nbeen detected and out of this 10.52 lakh cases pertain to individual\nassessees. Seeding of Aadhaar with PAN has certain benefits which have\nalready been enumerated. Furthermore, even when we address the issue of\nshell companies, fact remains that companies are after all floated by\nindividuals and these individuals have to produce documents to show their\nidentity. It was sought to be argued that persons found with duplicate/bogus\nPAN cards are hardly 0.4% and, therefore, there was no need to have such\na provision. We cannot go by percentage figures. The absolute number of\nsuch cases is 10.52 lakh, which figure, by no means, can be termed as\nminiscule, to harm the economy and create adverse effect on the nation.\nRespondents have argued that Aadhaar will ensure that there is no\nduplication of identity as bio-metric will not allow that and, therefore, it may\ncheck the growth of shell companies as well.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_112\">68 OA.No.170/00182/2020/CAT/BANGALORE &amp;</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_215\">CP.No.170/00141/2019/CAT/BANGALORE\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_216\">100) Having regard to the aforesaid factors, it cannot be said that there is no\nnexus with the objective sought to be achieved.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_217\">101) Another argument predicated on <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_225\">Article 14</a> advanced by Mr. Divan was\n_ that it was discriminatory in nature as it created two Classes; one class of\nthose who volunteered to enrol themselves under Aadhaar scheme and\nother class of those who did not want it to be so. It was further submitted\nthat in this manner this provision had the effect of creating an artificial class\n\nof those who object to Aadhaar scheme as self conscious persons. This is a\nfallacious argument.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_218\">102) Validity of a legislative act cannot be challenged by creating artificial\nclasses by those who are objecting to the said provision and predicating the\nargument of discrimination on that basis. :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_184\">When a law is made, all those who are covered by that law are supposed to\nfollow the same. No doubt, it is the right of a citizen to approach the Court\nand question the constitutional validity of a particular law enacted by the\nLegislature. However, merely. because a section of persons Opposes the\nlaw, would not mean that it has become a separate class by itself. Two\nclasses, cannot be created on this basis, namely, one of those who want to\nbe covered by the scheme, and others who do not want to be. covered\nthereby. If such a proposition is accepted, every legislation would be prone\nto challenge on the ground of discrimination. As far as plea of discrimination\nis concerned, it has to be raised by showing that the impugned law creates\ntwo classes without any reasonable classification and treats them differently.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_185\">103) The principle of equality does not mean that every law must have\nuniversal application for all persons who are not by nature, attainment or\ncircumstances, in the same position, as the varying needs. of different\nclasses of persons often require separate treatment. It is permissible for the\nState to classify persons for legitimate purposes. The Legislature is also\ncompetent to exercise its discretion and make Classification. In the present\nScenario the impugned legislation has created two classes, i.e. one class of\nthose persons who are assessees and other class of those persons who are\nincome tax assessees. It is because of the reason that the impugned\nprovision is applicable only to those who are filing income tax returns.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_219\">Therefore, the only question would be as to whether this classification is\nreasonable or not. There cannot be any dispute that there is a reasonable\nbasis for differentiation and, therefore, equal protection clause enshrined\nin <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_226\">Article 14</a> is not attracted.

It is in this context, principle of\nproportionality has been invoked by the petitioners with their submission that\n\nrestriction is unreasonable as it is utterly disproportionate for committing\nbreach of <a href=\"/doc/190513775/\" id=\"a_248\">Section 139AA</a> of the Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_233\">112) As noted above, Mr. Datar had relied upon the judgment of this Court\nin Modern Dental College &amp; Research Centre 48 and submitted that while\napplying the test of proportionality, the respondents were specifically\nrequired to demonstrate the that measures undertaken are necessary in that\n. there are no alternative measures that may similarly achieve that same\npurpose with a lesser degree of limitation (narrow tailoring) and also that\n_ there was proper relation between the importance of achieving the proper\npurpose and the social importance of preventing the limitation on the\nconstitutional right, (balancing two competing interests).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_234\">__ 113) In order to consider the aforesaid submissions we may bifurcate 48\nFootnote 7 above <a href=\"/doc/190513775/\" id=\"a_249\">Section 139AA</a> in two parts, as follows: .\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_235\">(i) That portion of the provision which requires quoting of Aadhaar number\n(sub-section(1)) and requirement of intimating Aadhaar number to the\nprescribed authorities by these who are PAN holders (sub-section (2)).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_236\">(li) Consequences of failure to intimate Aadhaar number to the prescribed\nauthority by specified date. -\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_237\">114) Insofar as first limb of <a href=\"/doc/190513775/\" id=\"a_250\">Section 139AA</a> of the Act is concerned, we have\n\nalready held that it was within the competence of the Parliament to make a\nprovision of this nature and further that it is not offensive of <a href=\"/doc/176933186/\" id=\"a_251\">Article 1 4</a> of the\nConstitution. This requirement, per se, does not find foul with <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_252\">Article\n19(1)(g)</a> of the Constitution either, inasmuch as, quoting the Aadhaar\nnumber for purposes mentioned in sub-section (1) or intimating the Aadhaar\nnumber to the prescribed authority as per the requirement of sub-section (2)\n\ndoes not, by itself, impinge upon the right to carry on profession or trade,\n\netc. Therefore, it is not violative of <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_253\">Article 19(1)(g)</a> of the Constitution either.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_238\">In fact, that is not even the argument of the petitioners. Entire emphasis of\n\nthe petitioners submissions, while addressing the arguments predicated\n\non <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_254\">Article 19(1)(g)</a> of the Constitution, is on the consequences that ensue in\n\nterms of proviso to sub-section (2) inasmuch as it is argued, as recorded\n\nabove, that the consequences provided will have the effect of paralysing the can\nright to carry on business/profession. Therefore, thrust is on the second part\nof <a href=\"/doc/190513775/\" id=\"a_255\">Section 139AA</a> of the Act, which we proceed to deal with, now. &quot;a\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_117\">73 OA.No.170/00182/2020/CAT/BANGALORE &amp;</span>\nCP.No.170/00141/2019/CAT/BANGALORE\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_239\">115) At the outset, it may be mentioned that though PAN is issued under the\nProvisions of the Act (<a href=\"/doc/189874154/\" id=\"a_256\">Section 139A</a>), its function is not limited to giving this\nnumber in the income-tax returns or for other acts to be performed under the\nAct, as mentioned in sub-sections (5), (SA), (5B), 5(C), 5(D) and 6 of Section\n\na telephone connection; making payment to hotels and restaurants when\nsuch payment exceeds Rs.25,000/- at any one time; while purchasing bank\ndrafts or pay orders for an amount aggregating Rs.50,000/- or more during\nany one day, when payment in cash; payment in cash in connection with\ntravel to any foreign country of an amount exceeding Rs.25,000/- at any one\ntime; while making payment of an amount of Rs.50,000/- or more to a\n\n&quot;Doctrine of proportionality explained and applied\n\n&quot;19.

Another significant feature which can be noticed from the reading of the\n\naforesaid clause is that the State is empowered to make any law relating to\nthe professional or technical qualifications necessary for practising any\n\nprofession or carrying on any occupation or trade or business. Thus, while\n\nexamining as to whether the impugned provisions of the statute and rules\namount to reasonable restrictions and are brought out in the interest of the\ngeneral public, the exercise that is required to be undertaken is the\n\n_ balancing of fundamental right to carry on occupation on the one hand-and\nthe restrictions imposed on the other hand. This is what is known as\n\n&#x27;doctrine of proportionality&quot;. Jurisprudentially, &quot;proportionality&quot; can be\ndefined as the set of rules determining the necessary and _ sufficient\nconditions for limitation of a constitutionally protected right by a law to be\n\n~ constitutionally permissible. According to Aharon Barak (former Chief\n\nJustice, Supreme Court of Israel), there are four sub-components of\nproportionality which need to be satisfied [ Aharon Barak, Proportionality:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_205\">Constitutional Rights and Their Limitation(Cambridge University Press\n\n~2012).J, a limitation of a constitutional right will be constitutionally\n\npermissible if: .\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_206\">(i) itis designated for a proper purpose;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_207\">(ii) the measures undertaken to effectuate such a limitation are rationally\nconnected to the fulfilment of that purpose;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_208\">(ii) the measures undertaken are necessary in that there are no alternative\n\nmeasures that may similarly achieve that same purpose with a lesser\ndegree of limitation; and finally\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_209\">(iv) there needs to be a proper relation (&quot;proportionality stricto sensu&quot; or\n&#x27;balancing&#x27;) between the importance of achieving the proper purpose and\nthe social importance of preventing the limitation on the constitutional right.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_243\">61.

The extent of its\n\nprotection prescribes the limitations on the exercises of the rights within its\n\nscope. In that sense, it defines the justification for limitations that can be\nimposed on such a right. -\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_119\">75 OA.No.170/00182/2020/CAT/BANGALORE &amp;</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_245\">CP.

The law imposing restrictions will be treated as proportional if it\n\niS meant to achieve a proper purpose, and if the measures taken to achieve\nsuch a purpose are rationally connected to the Purpose, and such measures\nare necessary. This essence of doctrine of proportionality is beautifully\ncaptured by Dickson, C.J. of Canada in R. v. Oakes, in the following words\n\n(at p.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_247\">138):\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_210\">&quot;To establish that a limit&#x27;is reasonable and demonstrably justified in a free\nand democratic society, two central criteria must be satisfied. First, the\nobjective, which the measures, responsible for a limit on a Charter right or\nfreedom are designed to serve, must be &quot;of&quot; sufficient importance to: warrant\noverriding a constitutional protected right or freedom ... Second ... the party\ninvoking <a href=\"/doc/716811/\" id=\"a_257\">Section 1</a> must show that the means chosen are reasonable and\ndemonstrably justified. This involves &#x27;a form of proportionality test...&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_248\">Although the nature of the proportionality test will vary depending on the\ncircumstances, in each case courts will be required to balance the interests\nof society with those of individuals and groups.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_249\">There are, in my view, three important components of a proportionality test. --\nFirst, the measures adopted must be ... rationally connected to the\nobjective. Second, the means ... should impair &#x27;as little as possible&quot; the right\nor freedom in question ... Third, there must be a proportionality between the\neffects of the measures which are responsible for limiting the Charter right or\nfreedom, and the objective which has been identified as of &quot;sufficient\nimportance&quot;. The more severe the deleterious effects of a measure, the\nmore important the objective must be if the measure is to be reasonable and\ndemonstrably justified in a free and democratic society.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_250\">64. The exercise which, therefore, is to be taken is to find out as to whether\nthe limitation of constitutional rights is for a purpose that is reasonable and\nnecessary in a democratic society and such an exercise involves the\nweighing up of competitive values, and ultimately an assessment based on\nproportionality i.e. balancing of different interests.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_251\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"61571\" id=\"span_121\">65. We may unhesitatingly remark that this doctrine of proportionality,\nexplained hereinabove in brief, is enshrined in <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_258\">Article 19</a> itself when we read\nClause (1) along with clause (6) thereof. While defining as to what\nconstitutes a reasonable restriction, this Court in a plethora of judgments\nhas held that the expression &#x27;reasonable restriction&quot; seeks to strike a\nbalance between the freedom guaranteed by any of the sub-clauses of\nclause (1) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_259\">Article 19</a> and the social control permitted by any of the clauses\n(2) to (6). It is held that the expression &quot;reasonable&quot; connotes that the\nlimitation imposed on a person in the enjoyment of the right should not be\narbitrary or of an excessive nature beyond what is required in the interests\n\nOf public. Further, in order to be reasonable, the restriction must have a\n\nreasonable relation to the object which the legislation seeks to achieve, and\n\nmust not go in excess of that object (see <a href=\"/doc/61571/\" id=\"a_260\">P.P.

At the same time, however,\nharsh reality is that benefits of these schemes have not reached those\npersons for whom that are actually meant.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_258\">India has achieved significant economic growth since independence. In\nparticular, rapid economic growth has been achieved in the last 25 years,\nafter the country adopted the policy of liberalisation and entered the era of,\nwhat is known as, globalisation. Economic growth in the last decade has\nbeen phenomena! and for many years, the Indian economy grew at highest\nrate in the world. At the same time, it is also a fact that in spite of significant\npolitical and economic success which has proved to be sound and\nsustainable, the benefits thereof have not percolated down to the poor and\nthe poorest. In fact, such benefits are reaped primarily by rich and upper\nmiddle classes, resulting into widening the gap between the rich and the\npoor. Jean Dreze &amp; Amartya Sen eithly narrate the position as under 50:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_211\">&quot;Since India&#x27;s recent record of fast economic growth is often celebrated, with\n\ngood reason, it is extremely important to point to the fact that the societal\n\nreach of economic progress in India has been remarkably limited. It is not\nonly that the income distribution has been getting more unequal in recent\nyears (a characteristic that India shares with China), but also that the rapid\nrise in real wages in China from which the working classes have benefited\ngreatly is not 50 An Uncertain Glory : India and its Contradictions matched\nat all by India&#x27;s relatively Stagnant real wages. No less importantly, the\npublic revenue generated by rapid economic growth has not been used to\nexpand the social and physical infrastructure in a determined and well-\nplanned way (in this India is left far behind by China). There is also a\ncontinued lack of essential social services (from schooling and health care\nto the provision of safe water and drainage) for a huge part of the\npopulation. As we will presently discuss, while India has been overtaking\nother countries in the progress of its real income, it has been overtaken in\nterms of social indicators by many of these countries, even within the region\n\nof South Asia itself (we go into this question more fully in Chapter 3, &#x27;India in\nComparative Perspective&#x27;).\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_212\">To point to just one contrast, even though India has significantly caught up\nwith China in terms of GDP growth, its progress has been very much slower\nthan China&#x27;s in indicators such as longevity, literacy, child undernourishment\nand maternal mortality. In South Asia itself, the much poorer economy of\nBangladesh has caught up with and overtaken India in terms of many social\nindicators (including life expectancy, immunization of children, infant\nmortality, child undernourishment and girls&#x27; schooling).

India has been climbing up the ladder of per capita income\nwhile slipping down the Slope of social indicators.&quot; It is in this context that\nnot only sustainable development is needed which takes care of integrating\ngrowth and development. thereby ensuring that the benefit of economic\ngrowth is reaped by every citizen of this country, it also becomes the duty of\nthe Government in a welfare Slate to come out with various welfare\nschemes which not only take care of immediate needs of the deprived class\nbut also ensure that adequate opportunities are provided to such persons to\nenable them to make their lives better, economically as well as socially. As\nmentioned above, various welfare schemes are, in fact, devised and floated\nfrom time to time by the Government, keeping aside substantial amount of\nmoney earmarked for spending on socially and economically: backward\nclasses. However, for various reasons including corruption, actual benefit\ndoes not reach those who are supposed to receive such benefits. One of the\nmain reasons is failure to identify these persons for lack of means by which\nidentity could be established of such genuine needy class, Resultantly, lots\nof ghosts and duplicate beneficiaries are able to take undue and\nimpermissible benefits. A former Prime Minister of this country51 has gone\nto record to say that out of one rupee spent by the Government for welfare\nof the downtrodden, only 15 paisa thereof actually reaches those persons\nfor whom it is meant.

No doubt, going by aforesaid, and may be some other\nsimilarly valid considerations, it is the intention of the Government to give\nphillip to Aadhaar movement and encourage the people of this country to\nenroll themselves under the Aadhaar scheme. oo\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_261\">119) Wether such a scheme should remain voluntary or it can be made\nmandatory imposing compulsiveness on the people to be covered by\nAadhaar is a different question which shall be addressed at the appropriate\nStage. At this juncture, it is only emphasised that malafides cannot be\nattributed to this scheme. In any case, we are concerned with the vires\nof <a href=\"/doc/190513775/\" id=\"a_264\">Section 139AA</a> of the Income Tax Act, 1961 which is a statutory provision.\nThis Court is, thus, dealing with the aspect of judicial review of legislation.\nInsofar as this provision is concerned, the explanation of the respondents in\nthe counter affidavit, which has already been reproduced above, is that the\nprimary purpose of introducing this provision was to take care of the problem\nof multiple PAN cards obtained in fictitious names. Such multiple cards in\nfictitious names are obtained with the motive of indulging into money\nlaundering, tax evasion, creation and channelising of black money. It is\nmentioned that in a de-duplication exercises, 11.35 lakhs cases of duplicate\nPANs/fraudulent PANs have been detected. Out of these, around 10.52\nlakhs pertain to individual assessees. Parliament in its wisdom thought that\none PAN to one person can be ensured by adopting Aadhaar for allottment\nof PAN to individuals. As of today, that is the only method available i.e. by\nseeding of existing PAN with Aadhaar. It is perceived as the best method,\nand the only robust method of de-duplication of PAN database. It is claimed\nby the respondents that the instance of duplicate Aadhaar is almost non-\nexistent. It is also claimed that seeding of PAN with Aadhaar may contribute\nto widening of the tax case as well, by checking the tax evasions and\nbringing in to tax hold those persons who are liable to pay tax but\ndeliberately avoid doing so. It would be apposite to quote the following\n\ndiscussion by the Comptroller and Auditor General in its report for the year\n2017: .\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_215\">&quot;Widening of Tax Base The assessee base grew over the last five years\n\nfrom 297.9 lakh taxpayers in 2005-06 to 340.9 lakh taxpayers in 2009-10 at\nthe rate of 14.4 percent. .\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_216\">The Department has different mechanisms available to enhance the\nassessee base which include inspection and survey, information sharing\nwith other tax departments and third party information available in annual\ninformation returns, Automation also facilitates greater cross linking.

Of the 76 lakhs\nindividual assesses who declare income above Rs. 5 lakhs, 56 lakhs are in\n\nthe salaried class. The number of people showing income more than 50\nlakhs in the entire country is only 1.72 lakh.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_262\">We can contrast this with the fact that in the last five years, more than 1.25\ncrore cars have been sold, and number of Indian citizens who flew abroad,\neither for business or tourism, is 2 crore in the year 2015. From all these\nfigures we can conclude that we are largely a tax non-compliant society. The\npredominance of the cash in the economy makes it possible for the people\nto evade their taxes. When too many people evade the taxes, the burden of\ntheir share falls on those who are honest and complaint.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_263\">121) The respondents have also claimed that linking of Aadhaar with PAN is\nconsistent with India&#x27;s international obligations and goals. In this behalf, it is\npointed out that India has signed the Inter-Governmental Agreement. (IGA)\nwith the USA on July 9, 2015, for Improving International Tax Compliance\nand implementing the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA). India\nhas also signed a multilateral agreement on June 3, 2015, to automatically\nexchange information based on <a href=\"/doc/19636/\" id=\"a_265\">Article 6</a> of the Convention on Mutual\nAdministrative Assistance in Tax Matters under the Common Reporting\nscheme (CRS), formally referred to as the Standard for Automatic Exchange\nof Financial Account Information (AEol). As part of India&#x27;s commitment\nunder FATCA and CRS, financial sector entities capture the details about\nthe customers using the PAN. In case the PAN or submitted details are\nfound to be incorrect or fictitious, it will create major embarrassment for the\ncountry. Under Non-filers Monitoring System (NMS), Income Tax\nDepartment identifies non-filers with potential tax liabilities. Data analysis is\ncarried out to identify non-filers about whom specific information was\navailable in AIR, CIB data and TDS/TCS Returns. Email/SMS and letters are\nsent to the identified non-filers communicating the information summary and\nseeking to know the submission details of Income tax return. In a large\nnumber of cases (more than 10 lac PAN every year) it is seen that the PAN\nholder neither submits the response and in many cases the letters are return\nunserved. Field verification by fields formations have found that in a large\nnumber of cases, the PAN holder is untraceable. In many cases, the PAN\nholder mentions that the transaction does not relate to them. There is a\nneed to strengthen PAN by linking it with Aadhaar/biometric information to\nprevent use of wrong PAN for high value transactions.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_264\">122) While considering the aforesaid submission of the petitioners, one has\nto keep in mind the aforesaid purpose of the impugned provision and what it\nseeks to achieve. The provision is aimed at seeding Aadhaar with PAN. We\nhave already held, while considering the submission based on <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_266\">Article 14</a> of\n\nthe Constitution, that the provision is based on reasonable classification and----\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_128\">83 OA.No.170/00182/2020/CAT/BANGALORE &amp;</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_265\">CP.No.170/00141/2019/CAT/BANGALORE\n\nthat has nexus with the objective sought to be achieved. One of the main\nobjectives is to de-duplicate PAN cards and to bring a situation where one\nperson is not having more than one PAN card or a person is not able to get\nPAN cards in assumed/fictitious names. In such a scenario, if those persons\nwho violate <a href=\"/doc/190513775/\" id=\"a_267\">Section 139AA</a> of the Act without any consequence, the\nprovision shall be rendered toothless. [t is the prerogative of the Legislature\nto make penal provisions for violation of any law made by it. In the instant\ncase, requirement of giving Aadhaar enrolment number to the designated\nauthority or stating this number in the income tax returns is directly\nconnected with the issue of duplicate/fake PANs.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_266\">123) At this juncture, we will also like to quote the following passages from\nthe nine Judge Bench judgment of this Court in Jindal Stainless Ltd. 52,\n\nwhich discussion though is in different context, will have some relevance to\nthe issue at hand as well:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_217\">&quot;109. It was next argued on behalf of the dealers that an unreasonably high\nrate of tax could by itself constitute a restriction offensive to <a href=\"/doc/121190/\" id=\"a_268\">Article 301</a> of\nthe Constitution. This was according to learned counsel for the dealers\nacknowledged even in the minority judgment delivered by Sinha, CJ in .\nAtiabari&#x27;s case (supra). If that be So, the only way such a restriction could\n\nmeet the constitutional requirements would be through the medium of the\nproviso to <a href=\"/doc/191273/\" id=\"a_269\">Article 304(b)</a> of the Constitution. There is, in our opinion, no merit\nin that contention either and we say So for two precise reasons. Firstly,\n\n_ because taxes whether high or low do not constitute restrictions on the\n\nfreedom of trade and commerce. We have held so in the previous\nparagraphs of the judgment based on our textual understanding of the\nprovisions of Part XIIl which is matched by the contextual interpretation.\nThat being 52 Footnote 40 above so the mere fact that a tax casts a heavy\nburden is no reason for holding that it is a restriction on the freedom of trade\nand commerce. Any such excessive tax burden may be open to challenge\nunder Part Ill of the Constitution but the extent of burden would not by itself\n\njustify the levy being struck down as a restriction contrary to <a href=\"/doc/121190/\" id=\"a_270\">Article 301</a> of\nthe Constitution.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_218\">110. Secondly because, levy of taxes is both an attribute of sovereignty and\nan unavoidable necessity. No responsible government can do without\nlevying and collecting taxes for it is only through taxes that governments are\nrun and objectives of general public good achieved. The conceptual or\njuristic. basis underlying the need for taxation has not, therefore, been\ndisputed by learned counsel for the dealers and, in our opinion, rightly so.\nThat taxation is essential for fulfilling the needs of the government is even\notherwise well-settled. A reference to &#x27;A Treatise on the Constitutional\nLimitations&quot; (8th Edn. 1927 - Vol. || Page 986) by Thomas M Cooley brings\n\nhome the point with commendable clarity. Dealing with power of taxation\nCooley says:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_219\">&quot;Taxes are defined to be burdens or charges imposed by the legislative\nPower upon persons or property, to raise money for public purposes. The\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_129\">84 OA.No.170/00182/2020/CAT/BANGALORE &amp;</span>\nCP.No.170/00141/2019/CAT/BANGALORE\n\npower to tax rests upon necessity, and is inherent in every sovereignty. The\nlegislature of every free State will possess it under the general grant of\nlegislative power, whether particularly specified in the constitution among\nthe powers to be exercised by it or not. No constitutional government can\nexist without it, and no arbitrary government. without regular and steady\ntaxation could be anything but an oppressive -and vexatious despotism,\nsince the only alternative to taxation would be a forced extortion for the\n\nneeds of government from such persons or objects as the men in power\nmight select as victims.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_267\">itself. The court said:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_220\">&quot;43. ..It is admitted that the power of taxing the people and their property is\nessential to the very existence of government, and may be legitimately\nexercised on the objects to which jit is applicable to the utmost extent to\nwhich the government may choose to carry it. The only security against the\nabuse of this power is found in the structure of the government itself. In\nimposing a tax, the legislature acts upon its constituents. This is, in general,\na sufficient security against erroneous and oppressive taxation,\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_221\">44. The people of a State, therefore, give to their government a right of\ntaxing themselves and_ their property; and as the exigencies of the\ngovernment cannot be limited, they prescribe no limits to the exercise of this\nright, resting confidently on the interest of the legislator, and on the influence\n\nof the constituents over their representative, to guard them against its\nabuse.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_268\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1377254\" id=\"span_130\">112. To the same effect is the decision of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/1377254/\" id=\"a_271\">State of Madras v.\nN.K. Nataraja Mudaliar</a> (AIR 1969 SC 147) where this Court recognized that\n\npolitical and economic forces would operate against the levy of an unduly\nhigh rate of tax. The Court said:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_222\">&quot;16.... Again, in a democratic constitution political forces would operate\nagainst the levy of an unduly high rate of tax.

If Aadhar number is not\n~ given, the aforesaid exercise ma y not be possible.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_225\">125) Having said so, it becomes clear from the aforesaid discussion that\nthose who are not PAN holders, while applying for PAN, they are required to\ngive Aadhaar number. This is the Stipulation of sub-section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/190513775/\" id=\"a_275\">Section\n139AA</a>, which we have already upheld.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_269\">At the same time, as far as existing PAN holders are concemed, since the\nimpugned provisions are yet to be considered on the touchstone of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_276\">Article\n21</a> of the Constitution, including on the debate around Right to Privacy and\nhuman dignity, etc. as limbs of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_277\">Article 21</a>, we are of the opinion that till the\naforesaid aspect of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_278\">Article 21</a> is decided by the Constitution Bench a partial\nstay of the aforesaid proviso is necessary. Those who have already\nenrolled themselves under Aadhaar scheme would comply with the\nrequirement of sub-section (2) of <a href=\"/doc/190513775/\" id=\"a_279\">Section 139AA</a> of the Act Those who still\nwant to enrol are free to do So. However, those assessees who are not\nAadhaar card holders and do not comply with the provision of <a href=\"/doc/43144358/\" id=\"a_280\">Section\n139(2)</a>, their PAN cards be not treated as invalid for the time being. It is only\nto facilitate other transactions which are mentioned in Rule 114B of the\nRules. We are adopting this course of action for more than one reason. We\nare saying so because of very severe consequences that entail in not\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_270\">-adhering to the requirement of sub-section (2) of <a href=\"/doc/190513775/\" id=\"a_281\">Section 139AA</a> of the Act.\nA person who is holder of PAN and if his PAN is invalidated, he is bound to\nsuffer immensely in his day to day dealings, which situation should be\navoided till the Constitution Bench authoritatively determines the argument\n\nlimiting the consequences.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_271\">126) However, at the same time, we find that proviso to <a href=\"/doc/178877346/\" id=\"a_282\">Section\n139AA(2)</a> cannot be read retrospectively. If failure to intimate the Aadhaar\nnumber renders PAN void ab initio with the deeming provision that the PAN\nallotted would. be invalid as if the person had not applied for allotment of\nPAN would have rippling effect of unsettling settled rights of the parties. It\n\nregistration by a particular assessee. The rights which are already accrued\nto a person in law cannot be faken away. Therefore, this provision needs to\nbe read down by making it clear that it would operate prospectively.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_272\">127) Before we part with, few comments are needed, as we feel that these\nare absolutely essential:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_226\">(i) Validity of Aadhaar, whether jt is under the Aadhaar scheme or the\n\nAadhaar Act, is already under challenge on the touchstone of <a href=\"/doc/1540780/\" id=\"a_283\">Article 24</a> of\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_131\">86 OA.No.170/00182/2020/CAT/BANGALORE &amp;</span>\nCP.No.170/00141/2019/CAT/BANGALORE\n\nthe Constitution.

First\nand foremost is that it violates Right to Privacy and Right to Privacy is part\nof <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_285\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. Secondly, it is also argued that it violates\nhuman dignity which is another aspect of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_286\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_273\">Since the said matter has already been referred to the Constitution Bench,\nwe have consciously avoided discussion, though submissions in this behalf\nhave been taken note of. We feel that all the aspect of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_287\">Article 21</a> needs to be\n\ndealt with by the Constitution Bench. That is a reason we have deliberately\nrefrained from entering into the said arena.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_274\">(ii) It was submitted by the counsel for the petitioners themselves that they\nwould be confining their challenge to the impugned provision on <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_288\">Articles 14</a>\nand <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_289\">19</a> of the Constitution as well as competence of the Legislature, while\naddressing the arguments, other facets of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_290\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution were\nalso touched upon. Since we are holding that <a href=\"/doc/190513775/\" id=\"a_291\">Section 139AA</a> of the Income\nTax Act is not violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_292\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_293\">19(1)(g)</a> of the Constitution and\nalso that there was no impediment in the way of Parliament to insert such a\nstatutory provision (subject to reading down the proviso to sub-section (2)\nof <a href=\"/doc/190513775/\" id=\"a_294\">Section 139AA</a> of the Act as given above), we make it clear that the\nimpugned provision has passed the muster of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_295\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/81771913/\" id=\"a_296\">1 9(1)(g)</a> of the\nConstitution. However, more stringent test as to whether this statutory\nprovision violates <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_297\">Article 21</a> or not is yet to be qualified.

This is a concern which needs to be\naddressed by the Government. It is important that the aforesaid\napprehensions are assuaged by taking proper measures so that confidence\nis instilled among the public at large that there is no chance of unauthorised\nleakage of data whether it is done by tightening the operations of the\ncontractors who are given the job of enrollment, they being private persons\nor by prescribing severe penalties to those who are found guilty of leaking\nthe details, is the outlook of the Government.
