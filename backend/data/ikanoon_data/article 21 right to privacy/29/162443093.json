Petitioner was shown as Accused No.4. On completion\n\nof investigation, charge sheet is filed Vide PRC No.485 of 2019 in\n\nthe Court of VIII Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate,\n\nHyderabad and the matter is pending. In substance, allegation is\n\nthat petitioner along with three others attacked one person by\n\nname Syed Hussain with deadly weapons at Banana Market,\n\nbesides   Minar   Garden,   Nayapool,   Hyderabad   and     deceased\n\nsuccumb to several stab injuries.       After involvement of the\n\npetitioner in the above crime, rowdy sheet was opened on\n\n27.6.2019 in Mirchowk Police Station and on the point of\n\njurisdiction, the rowdy sheet was transferred to Bhavaninagar\n\nPolice Station on 22.12.2019.

Right to life and liberty are sacrosanct to a person. A person\n\nis entitled to lead his life with dignity and self respect.                             He is\n\nentitled to privacy.             His rights flow out of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_9\">Article 21</a> of the\n\nConstitution of India.              Surveillance on person certainly infringes\n\non his right to life, privacy and liberty.                    These rights cannot be\n\ninfringed except by due process of law. Compelling public interest\n\nmay require intrusion into privacy of a person but while doing so\n\ngreat care and caution has to be observed. Thus, if police open a\n\nrowdy sheet to keep surveillance on a person it must show\n\njustification, impelled to ensure peace and order in the society.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_7\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"232602\" id=\"span_3\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1470089\" id=\"span_4\">5.

Right to reputation is an integral part of right to life\n         guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_15\">Article 21</a>, and such a right cannot be deprived\n         except in accordance with the procedure established by law.\n         Such laws which authorise the Police to open rowdy sheets and\n         exercise surveillance are required to be very strictly construed.\n         Opening of the rowdy sheets and retention thereof except in\n         accordance with law would amount to infringement of\n         fundamental right guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_16\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution\n         of India. It is true that the State is duty bound at all levels to\n         protect the persons and property from the criminals and\n         criminal activity. Prevention of organised crime is an obligation\n         on the part of the State.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">         Right to Privacy:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">         32. Fundamental rights and civil liberties exist and can only\n         flourish in an orderly society. Civil liberties and fundamental\n         rights are intimately connected with the nature and dynamics\n         of the Society. It is the duty of the Police to deal with crime and\n         criminals expeditiously and effectively while at the same time\n         holding to the values and concepts of the fundamental rights\n         and the Constitution. Both the competing interests are to be\n         reconciled. This much is clear so far as our Constitutional\n         system is concerned that intrusion into personal liberty without\n         an authority of law is forbidden. Surveillance and watching of\n         movements of a citizen by the Police is not a matter of course.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_9\">         Such rights can be exercised by the Police only in accordance\n         with law which permits such surveillance. The action in this\n         regard which is in accordance with law may result in violation\n         of the fundamental rights guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_17\">Article 21</a> of the\n         Constitution of India. Every citizen has fundamental right and\n         entitled to indulge in harmless activities without observation or\n         interference. It is a right to be left alone. The guarantee in\n         <a href=\"/doc/691208/\" id=\"a_18\">Article 8</a> of the European Convention of Human Rights that\n         &quot;Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life,\n         his home and has correspondence&quot; reflects both the individual&#x27;s\n         psychological need to preserve an intrusion-free zone of\n         personality and family, and the anguish and stress which can\n         be suffered when that zone is violated. The saying that &#x27;an\n         Englishman&#x27;s home is his castle&#x27; would be equally applicable to\n         Indian situation and it can be said that an &#x27;Indian citizen&#x27;s\n         home is his castle.&#x27;\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_10\">         33. Therefore, I have no hesitation whatsoever to reject the\n         plea that mere surveillance and watch by the Police itself\n         would not infringe the fundamental rights of a citizen.\n         Such surveillance and watch which is not authorised by\n         law may be unconstitutional. Such surveillance and watch\n         even if it is authorised by law but if it is not in accordance\n         with that law would equally be unconstitutional.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\">                                              (emphasis supplied)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\">7.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"232602\" id=\"span_10\">In paragraph 49 of <a href=\"/doc/232602/\" id=\"a_19\">Sunkara Satyanarayana</a> (supra), learned\n\nsingle Judge culled out principles on police surveillance against\n\nhistory/rowdy sheeters.

Therefore, in the context of police surveillance against\n         history sheeters and rowdy sheeters, the following principles\n         vis-a-vis right to privacy under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_20\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution\n         would emerge:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">            (i) If the surveillance is not obtrusive, the same does not\n         violate the right to privacy under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_21\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution\n         of India. The same does not either in material or palpable form\n         affect the right of the suspect to move freely nor can it be held\n         to deprive the history sheeter / rowdy sheeter of his personal\n         liberty.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">          (ii) In testing whether fundamental right of free movement or\n         personal liberty is infringed or not, it is to be remembered that\n                                                                                             PNR,J\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                                                               WP No.18288 of 2020</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                               5</span>\n\n             infringement should be direct as well as tangible. If surveillance\n             hurts personal sensitivities, the same is not a violation, for the\n             constitution makers never intended to protect mere personal\n             sensitiveness.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">                (iii)     If police surveillance is in accordance with\n             executive/departmental guidelines and not authorised by\n             statute or rules having statutory force, it is for the State to\n             prove that surveillance does not in anyway infringe the\n             fundamental right of the person and that the authorities have\n             followed the guidelines scrupulously in ordering surveillance,\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">                (iv)  If the action of the police is found to infringe the\n             freedoms guaranteed to the history sheeter / rowdy sheeter and\n             violates his right to privacy, in that, the surveillance is\n             excessively obtrusive and intrusive, it may seriously encroach\n             on the privacy of a citizen as to infringe the fundamental right\n             to privacy and personal liberty under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_22\">Article 21</a> as well as the\n             freedom of movement guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1024002/\" id=\"a_23\">Article 19(1)(d)</a> of the\n             Constitution of India and the same is impermissible,\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">               (v) Even where there is statutory sanction for surveillance\n             against history sheeter/rowdy sheeter principle (iv) is equally\n             applicable, if the surveillance is obtrusive.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">                (vi) In either case-whether police regulations are statutory\n             or where they have no statutory force-there should be sufficient\n             material to induce the opinion that the history sheeters/rowdy\n             sheeters show a determination to lead a life of crime which\n             involves public peace or security only. Mere convictions in\n             criminal cases where nothing imperils the safety of the society\n             cannot be regarded as warrange surveillance under the relevant\n             regulations, however broadly and in whatever language the\n             regulation might have been couched,\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">               (vii) In either case-whether the regulation is statutory or\n             non-statutory-domiciliary visits and picketing by the police\n             should be reduced to the clearest cases of danger to community\n             security, and there can be no routine follow-up at the end of a\n             conviction or release from prison in every case.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">                (viii) The above principles that emerge from various binding\n             precedents are only general principles. As seen from various\n             decided cases of this Court, opening of history sheet or rowdy\n             sheet can be justified only when it is proved before the Court by\n             the State that based on the relevant material the competent\n             police officer has applied mind with due care and considered all\n             aspects in the light of the law and then ordered opening of\n             history sheet or rowdy sheet or ordered continuation or retention\n             of the history sheet.

In W.P.No.19194 of 2012, learned single Judge of this Court\n\nin the judgment rendered on 24.08.2015 reviewed the entire case\n\nlaw on the subject.      The learned single Judge held that the\n\nrequirement to open a rowdy sheet would arise if a person is\n\ninvolved in more than two crimes and, therefore, held that opening\n\nrowdy sheet for involving in two crimes as tainted in law from the\n\ninception. In the case on hand also, petitioner is involved in only\n\ntwo crimes.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_27\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\">14.   As held in precedent decisions, PSO is non-statutory\n\ninstrument to guide police in discharge of their duties. It can not\n\ngive license to police to open rowdy sheet in a casual and\n\nmechanical manner. Opening of rowdy sheet is not as a matter of\n\ncourse whenever crimes are reported. Opening rowdy sheet against\n\npetitioner and continuing, in the facts of this case, cannot be\n\ntermed as in public interest. Petitioner&#x27;s right to life and liberty is\n\ninfringed by police without reasonable cause.     It is made in abuse\n\nof power and authority, is illegal and infraction of fundamental\n\nrights guaranteed to petitioner.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_29\">15.   The decision impugned in the Writ Petition to continue\n\nrowdy sheet is set aside. Writ Petition is accordingly allowed.\n\nRespondents 4 and 5 are directed to forthwith close the rowdy\n\nsheet and inform the petitioner accordingly. Pending miscellaneous\n\npetitions if any shall stand closed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_30\">                                           __________________________\n                                           JUSTICE P.NAVEEN RAO\nDate: 07.12.2020\nTvk/kkm\n                                                           PNR,J\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                                             WP No.18288 of 2020</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                          8</span>\n\n\n\n\n          HON&#x27;BLE SRI JUSTICE P.NAVEEN RAO\n\n\n\n\n           WRIT PETITION NO.18288 OF 2020\n\n                   Date: 07.12.2020\nTvk/kkm\n </p>","numcites":13,"numcitedby":1,"docsource":"Telangana High Court","citetid":162443093,"divtype":"judgments","relatedqs":[{"value":"right to privacy ","formInput":"right%20to%20privacy%20"},{"value":"opening rowdy sheet","formInput":"opening%20rowdy%20sheet"},{"value":"article 21","formInput":"article%2021"},{"value":"rowdy sheeter ","formInput":"rowdy%20sheeter%20"},{"value":"right to life","formInput":"right%20to%20life"},{"value":"rowdy sheet","formInput":"rowdy%20sheet"},{"value":"personal liberty","formInput":"personal%20liberty"},{"value":"history sheet","formInput":"history%20sheet"},{"value":"privacy","formInput":"privacy"},{"value":"history sheeter ","formInput":"history%20sheeter%20"},{"value":"Surveillance","formInput":"Surveillance"},{"value":"public order","formInput":"public%20order"},{"value":"surveillance by police","formInput":"surveillance%20by%20police"},{"value":"breach  citedby: 386021","formInput":"breach%20%20citedby%3A%20386021"},{"value":"\"article 21\"","formInput":"%22article%2021%22"},{"value":"\"public order is\"","formInput":"%22public%20order%20is%22"},{"value":"history","formInput":"history"},{"value":"Article 21  filter:  case laws","formInput":"Article%2021%20%20filter%3A%20%20case%20laws"},{"value":"p naveen rao","formInput":"p%20naveen%20rao"}],"cats":[{"value":"protection-of-life-and-liberty","formInput":"tag:protection-of-life-and-liberty"},{"value":"security-for-keeping-peace","formInput":"tag:security-for-keeping-peace"},{"value":"murder","formInput":"tag:murder"},{"value":"abetment","formInput":"tag:abetment"},{"value":"destruction-of-evidence","formInput":"tag:destruction-of-evidence"}],"courtcopy":true,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
