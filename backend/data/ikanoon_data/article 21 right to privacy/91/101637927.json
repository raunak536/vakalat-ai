In the\n\n       absence of any indication that the office of the Chief Justice of\n\n       India is a separate establishment with its own CPIO, it cannot be\n\n       canvassed that “the office of the CPIO of the Supreme Court is\n\n       different from the office of the CJI” (that is, the Chief Justice of\n\n       India).

Therefore, when <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_160\">Section 8</a>\n                 exempts certain information from being disclosed, it\n                 should not be considered to be a fetter on the right to\n                 information, but as an equally important provision\n                 protecting other public interests essential for the\n                 fulfilment and preservation of democratic ideals.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_88\">                 62.

The term “fiduciary relationship”\n                 is used to describe a situation or transaction where one\n                 person (beneficiary) places complete confidence in\n                 another person (fiduciary) in regard to his affairs,\n                 business or transaction(s). The term also refers to a\n                 person who holds a thing in trust for another\n                 (beneficiary). The fiduciary is expected to act in\n                 confidence and for the benefit and advantage of the\n                 beneficiary, and use good faith and fairness in dealing\n                 with the beneficiary or the things belonging to the\n                 beneficiary.

In this way, the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_180\">RTI Act</a> complements both\n\n       the right to information and the right to privacy and confidentiality.\n\n       Further, it moderates and regulates the conflict between the two\n\n       rights by applying the test of larger public interest or comparative\n\n       examination of public interest in disclosure of information with\n\n       possible harm and injury to the protected interests.\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_62\">Civil Appeal No. 10044 of 2010 &amp; Ors.

A\n                 consequence of this duty is that a fiduciary must make\n                 available to a customer all the information that is\n                 relevant to the customer’s affairs.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_96\">                 (iv) Duty of confidentiality — A fiduciary must only use\n                 information obtained in confidence and must not use it\n                 for his own advantage, or for the benefit of another\n                 person.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_68\">34.    Fiduciary relationships, regardless of whether they are formal,\n\n       informal, voluntary or involuntary, must satisfy the four conditions\n\n       for a relationship to classify as a fiduciary relationship. In each of\n\n       the four principles, the emphasis is on trust, reliance, the\n\n       fiduciary’s superior power or dominant position and corresponding\n\n       dependence of the beneficiary on the fiduciary which imposes\n\n       responsibility on the fiduciary to act in good faith and for the\n\n       benefit of and to protect the beneficiary and not oneself. <a href=\"/doc/1494553/\" id=\"a_183\">Section\n\n       8(1)(e)</a> is a legal acceptance that there are ethical or moral\n\n       relationships or duties in relationships that create rights and\n\n       obligations,      beyond         contractual,   routine   or   even   special\n\n       relationships with standard and typical rights and obligations.\n\n       Contractual or non-fiduciary relationships could require that the\n\n       party should protect and promote the interest of the other and not\n\n       cause harm or damage, but the fiduciary relationship casts a\n\n       positive obligation and demands that the fiduciary should protect\n\n       the beneficiary and not promote personal self-interest. A\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_65\">Civil Appeal No. 10044 of 2010 &amp; Ors.                                    Page 44 of 108</span>\n\f          fiduciary’s loyalty, duties and obligations are stricter than the\n\n          morals of the market place and it is not honesty alone, but the\n\n          punctilio of an honour which is the most sensitive standard of\n\n          behaviour which is applied {See – Opinion of Cardozo, J. in\n\n          Meinhard v.

Thus, the level of judicial scrutiny in cases\n\n          of fiduciary relationship is intense as the level of commitment and\n\n          loyalty expected is higher than non-fiduciary relationships.\n\n          Fiduciary relationship may arise because of the statute which\n\n          requires a fiduciary to act selflessly with integrity and fidelity and\n\n          the other party, that is the beneficiary, depends upon the wisdom\n\n          and confidence reposed in the fiduciary. A contractual, statutory\n\n          and possibly all relationships cover a broad field, but a fiduciary\n\n          relationship could exist, confined to a limited area or an act, as\n\n          relationships can have several facets. Thus, relationships can be\n\n          partly fiduciary and partly non-fiduciary with the former being\n\n          confined to a particular act or action which need not manifest itself\n\n          in entirety in the interaction and relationship between two parties.\n\n          What would distinguish non-fiduciary relationship from fiduciary\n\n          relationship or an act is the requirement of trust reposed, higher\n\n          standard of good faith and honesty required on the part of the\n\n          fiduciary with reference to a particular transaction(s) due to moral,\n\n\n17   (1928) 164 N.E. 545, 546\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_66\">Civil Appeal No. 10044 of 2010 &amp; Ors.

While previously information that could be considered personal\n\n         would have been protected only if it were exchanged in a\n\n         confidential relationship or considered confidential by nature,\n\n         significant developments in jurisprudence since the 1990’s have\n\n         posited the acceptance of privacy as a separate right and\n\n         something worthy of protection on its own as opposed to being\n\n         protected under an actionable claim for breach of confidentiality. A\n\n         claim to protect privacy is, in a sense, a claim for the preservation\n\n         of confidentiality of personal information. With progression of the\n\n         right to privacy, the underlying values of the law that protects\n\n         personal information came to be seen differently as the courts\n\n         recognised that unlike law of confidentiality that is based upon\n\n         duty of good faith, right to privacy focuses on the protection of\n\n         human autonomy and dignity by granting the right to control the\n\n         dissemination of information about one’s private life and the right\n\n         to the esteem and respect of other people (See - Sedley LJ\n\n         in Douglas v. Hello! Ltd22). In PJS v. News Group Newspapers\n\n         Ltd.23, the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom had drawn a\n\n\n22   (2001) QB 967\n23   (2016) UKSC 26\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_71\">Civil Appeal No. 10044 of 2010 &amp; Ors.                             Page 50 of 108</span>\n\f       distinction between the right to respect private and family life or\n\n       privacy and claims based upon confidentiality by observing that\n\n       the law extends greater protection to privacy rights than rights in\n\n       relation to confidential matters. In the former case, the claim for\n\n       misuse of private information can survive even when information\n\n       is in the public domain as its repetitive use itself leads to violation\n\n       of the said right. The right to privacy gets the benefit of both the\n\n       quantitative and the qualitative protection. The former refers to the\n\n       disclosure already made and what is yet undisclosed, whereas the\n\n       latter refers to the privateness of the material, invasion of which is\n\n       an illegal intrusion into the right to privacy. Claim for confidentiality\n\n       would generally fail when the information is in public domain. The\n\n       law of privacy is, therefore, not solely concerned with the\n\n       information, but more concerned with the intrusion and violation of\n\n       private rights. Citing an instance of how publishing of defamatory\n\n       material can be remedied by a trial establishing the falsity of such\n\n       material and award of damages, whereas invasion of privacy\n\n       cannot be similarly redressed, the Court had highlighted the\n\n       reason why truth or falsity of an allegation or information may be\n\n       irrelevant when it comes to invasion of privacy. Therefore, claims\n\n       for protection against invasion of private and family life do not\n\n       depend upon confidentiality alone.

If the right is to be held\n                    to be not attached to the person, then “we would not\n                    shield our account balances, income figures and\n                    personal telephone and address books from the public\n                    eye, but might instead go about with the information\n                    written on our ‘foreheads or our bumper stickers’.” He\n                    observes that the majority in Miller confused “privacy”\n                    with “secrecy” and that “even their notion of secrecy is\n                    a strange one, for a secret remains a secret even when\n                    shared with those whom one selects for one&#x27;s\n                    confidence”.

While physical\n\n       privacy enjoys constitutional recognition in <a href=\"/doc/1024002/\" id=\"a_198\">Article 19(1)(d)</a> and (e)\n\n       read with <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_199\">Article 21</a>, personal informational privacy is relatable to\n\n       <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_200\">Article 21</a> and right to privacy of choice is enshrined in <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_201\">Articles\n\n       19(1)(a)</a> to (c), 20(3), 21 and 25 of the Constitution. In the\n\n       concurring opinion, there is a reference to ‘The Right to Privacy’\n\n       by Samuel Warren and Louis D. Brandeis on an individual’s right\n\n       to control the dissemination of personal information and that an\n\n       individual has a right to limit access to such information/shield\n\n       such information from unwarranted access. Knowledge about a\n\n       person gives another power over that person, as personal data\n\n       collected is capable of effecting representations in his decision\n\n       making process and shaping behaviour which can have a\n\n       stultifying effect on the expression of dissent which is the\n\n       cornerstone of democracy. In the said concurring judgment, it has\n\n       been further held that the right to protection of reputation from\n\n       being unfairly harmed needs to be zealously guarded not only\n\n       against falsehood but also against certain truths by observing:</span>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_79\">Civil Appeal No. 10044 of 2010 &amp; Ors.

Read in this manner, what is stipulated by <a href=\"/doc/839514/\" id=\"a_229\">Section\n                    11(1)</a> is that when an information seeker files an\n                    application which relates to or has been supplied by\n                    third party, the PIO has to examine whether the said\n                    information is treated as confidential or can be treated\n                    as confidential by the third party. If the answer is in the\n                    possible sphere of affirmative or &quot;maybe yes&quot;, then the\n                    procedure prescribed in <a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_230\">Section 11</a> has to be followed\n                    for determining whether the larger public interest\n                    requires such disclosure. When information per se or\n                    ex facie cannot be regarded as confidential, then the\n                    procedure under <a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_231\">section 11</a> is not to be followed. All\n                    information relating to or furnished by a third party\n                    need not be confidential for various reasons including\n                    the factum that it is already in public domain or in\n                    circulation, right of third party is not affected or by law\n\n\n38   AIR 2012 Delhi 29\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_103\">Civil Appeal No. 10044 of 2010 &amp; Ors.                                     Page 68 of 108</span>\n\f                 is required to be disclosed etc. The aforesaid\n                 interpretation takes care of the difficulties visualised by\n                 the appellant like marks obtained in an examination, list\n                 of BPL families, etc. In such cases, normally plea of\n                 privacy or confidentiality does not arise as the said list\n                 has either been made public, available in the public\n                 domain or has been already circulated to various third\n                 parties. On the other hand, in case the word “or” is\n                 read as “and”, it may lead to difficulties and problems,\n                 including invasion of right of privacy/confidentiality of a\n                 third party. For example, a public authority may have in\n                 its records, medical reports or prescriptions relating to\n                 third person but which have not been supplied by the\n                 third person. If the interpretation given by the appellant\n                 is accepted then such information can be disclosed to\n                 the information seeker without following the procedure\n                 prescribed in <a href=\"/doc/839514/\" id=\"a_232\">Section 11(1)</a> as the information was not\n                 furnished or supplied by the third person. Such\n                 examples can be multiplied. Furthermore, the\n                 difficulties and anomalies pointed out can even arise\n                 when the word “or” is read as “and” in cases where the\n                 information is furnished by the third party. For example,\n                 for being enrolled as a BPL family, information may\n                 have been furnished by the third party who is in the list\n                 of BPL families. Therefore, the reasonable and proper\n                 manner of interpreting <a href=\"/doc/839514/\" id=\"a_233\">Section 11(1)</a> is to keep in mind\n                 the test stipulated by the proviso. It has to be examined\n                 whether information can be treated and regarded as\n                 being of confidential nature, if it relates to a third party\n                 or has been furnished by a third party. Read in this\n                 manner, when information relates to a third party and\n                 can be prima facie regarded and treated as\n                 confidential, the procedure under <a href=\"/doc/839514/\" id=\"a_234\">Section 11(1)</a> must\n                 be followed. Similarly, in case information has been\n                 provided by the third party and has been prima facie\n                 treated by the said third party as confidential, again the\n                 procedure prescribed under <a href=\"/doc/839514/\" id=\"a_235\">Section 11(1)</a> has to be\n                 followed.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_134\">                                    xx      xx            xx\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_135\">                 16. Thus, <a href=\"/doc/839514/\" id=\"a_236\">Section 11(1)</a> postulates two circumstances\n                 when the procedure has to be followed. Firstly when\n                 the information relates to a third party and can be\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_104\">Civil Appeal No. 10044 of 2010 &amp; Ors.

The second situation\n                 is when information is provided and given by a third\n                 party to a public authority and prima facie the third\n                 party who has provided information has treated and\n                 regarded the said information as confidential. The\n                 procedure given in <a href=\"/doc/839514/\" id=\"a_237\">Section 11(1)</a> applies to both\n                 cases.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_105\">61.    We would clarify that <a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_238\">Section 11</a> is not merely procedural but also\n\n       a substantive provision which applies when the PIO intends to\n\n       disclose information that relates to or has been supplied by a third\n\n       party and has been treated as confidential by that third party. It\n\n       requires the PIO to issue notice to the third party who may make\n\n       submission in writing or orally, which submission has to be kept in\n\n       view while taking a decision. Proviso to <a href=\"/doc/839514/\" id=\"a_239\">Section 11(1)</a> applies in all\n\n       cases except trade or commercial secrets protected by law.\n\n       Pertinently,      information including trade secrets,         intellectual\n\n       property rights, etc. are governed by clause (d) to sub-section (1)\n\n       of <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_240\">Section 8</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1053993/\" id=\"a_241\">Section 9</a> of the RTI Act. In all other cases where\n\n       the information relates to or has been supplied by the third party\n\n       and treated as confidential by that third party, disclosure in terms\n\n       of the proviso may be allowed where the public interest in\n\n       disclosure outweighs in importance any possible harm or injury to\n\n       the interest of the third party. Confidentiality is protected and\n\n       preserved in law because the public interest requires such\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_105\">Civil Appeal No. 10044 of 2010 &amp; Ors.                                 Page 70 of 108</span>\n\f       protection. It helps and promotes free communication without fear\n\n       of retaliation. However, public interest in protecting confidentiality\n\n       is subject to three well-known exceptions. The first exception\n\n       being a public interest in the disclosure of iniquity for there cannot\n\n       be any loss of confidentiality involving a wrongdoing. Secondly,\n\n       there cannot be any public interest when the public has been\n\n       misled. Thirdly, the principle of confidentiality does not apply when\n\n       the disclosure relates to matters of public concern, which\n\n       expression is vastly different from news value or news to satiate\n\n       public curiosity. Public concern relates to matters which are an\n\n       integral part of free speech and expression and entitlement of\n\n       everyone to truth and fair comment about it. There are certain\n\n       circumstances         where      the   public   interest   in   maintaining\n\n       confidentiality may be outweighed by the public interest in\n\n       disclosure and, thus, in common law, it may not be treated by the\n\n       courts as confidential information. These aspects would be\n\n       relevant under the proviso to <a href=\"/doc/839514/\" id=\"a_242\">Section 11(1)</a> of the RTI Act.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_106\">62.    Proviso to <a href=\"/doc/839514/\" id=\"a_243\">Section 11(1)</a> of the RTI Act is a statutory recognition of\n\n       three exceptions and more when it incorporates public interest\n\n       test. It states that information, otherwise treated confidential, can\n\n       be disclosed if the public interest in disclosure outweighs the\n\n       possible harm and injury to the interest of such a third party.

In some instances\n                   disclosure of confidential information entrusted to a\n                   servant of the Crown may result in a financial loss to\n                   the public. In other instances such disclosure may tend\n                   to harm the public interest by impeding the efficient\n                   attainment of proper governmental ends, and the\n                   revelation of defence or intelligence secrets certainly\n                   falls into that category. The Crown, however, as\n                   representing the nation as a whole, has no private life\n                   or personal feelings capable of being hurt by the\n                   disclosure of confidential information. In so far as the\n                   Crown acts to prevent such disclosure or to seek\n                   redress for it on confidentiality grounds, it must\n                   necessarily, in my opinion, be in a position to show that\n                   the disclosure is likely to damage or has damaged the\n                   public interest. How far the Crown has to go in order to\n                   show this must depend on the circumstances of each\n                   case. In a question with a Crown servant himself, or\n                   others acting as his agents, the general public interest\n                   in the preservation of confidentiality, and in\n                   encouraging other Crown servants to preserve it, may\n                   suffice.”\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_111\">64.       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"751534\" id=\"span_110\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1180101\" id=\"span_111\">In <a href=\"/doc/1180101/\" id=\"a_247\">R.K.

Though the court would not\n                 substitute its views to that of the executive on matters\n                 of policy, it is its undoubted power and duty to see that\n                 the executive exercises its power only for the purpose\n                 for which it is granted. Secrecy of the advice or opinion\n                 is by no means conclusive. Candour, frankness and\n                 confidentiality though are integral facets of the common\n                 genus i.e., efficient governmental functioning, per se by\n                 means conclusive but be kept in view in weighing the\n                 balancing act. Decided cases show that power often\n                 was exercised in excess thereof or for an ulterior\n                 purpose etc. Sometimes the public service reasons will\n                 be decisive of the issue, but they should never prevent\n                 the court from weighing them against the injury which\n                 would be suffered in the administration of justice if the\n                 document was not to be disclosed, and the likely injury\n                 to the cause of justice must also be assessed and\n                 weighed. Its weight will vary according to the nature of\n                 the proceedings in which disclosure is sought, level at\n                 which the matter was considered; the subject matter of\n                 consideration; the relevance of the documents and that\n                 degree of likelihood that the document will be of\n                 importance in the litigation. In striking the balance, the\n                 court may always, if it thinks it necessary, itself inspect\n                 the documents. It is, therefore the constitutional,\n                 legitimate and lawful power and duty of this Court to\n                 ensure that powers, constitutional, statutory or\n                 executive are exercised in accordance with the\n                 Constitution and the law.

Debating with\n\n        candour, the Court observed, is not equivalent to expression of\n\n        impropriety. The candidates, it was noticed, had undergone\n\n        gruelling scrutiny in the public interviews, and therefore disclosure\n\n        of deliberation would not act as a dampener for future candidates.\n\n        More importantly, the Constitutional Court had distinguished the\n\n        authority and power with the Courts under Rule 53 to access the\n\n        deliberation record, with the different right to access information\n\n        under the Promotion to Access to Information Act, 2000 (PAIA),\n\n        which was the basis of the minority judgment for rejection of\n\n        production of the JSC’s deliberation record.

The PAIA grants any person or busybody a right to access any\n\n       information without explaining whatsoever as to why she or he\n\n       requires the information. This had to be balanced, with the need to\n\n       incentivise people to furnish private information, where such\n\n       information is required for facilitating the government machinery,\n\n       and therefore, considerations of confidentiality are applied as the\n\n       person furnishing information must be made aware that the\n\n       information would not be unhesitatingly divulged to others,\n\n       including busybodies, for no particular reason. This facilitates the\n\n       exercise of power and performance of functions of the state\n\n       functionaries.        In court matters under Rule 53, concerns of\n\n       confidentiality could be addressed by imposing stringent and\n\n       restrictive conditions on the right to access information, including\n\n       furnishing of confidentiality undertakings for restraining the\n\n       divulgence of details to third parties.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_147\">83.

The 99th Constitution Amendment Act and the\n                 NJAC Act have not taken note of the privacy concerns of\n                 an individual. This is important because it was submitted\n                 by the learned Attorney General that the proceedings of\n                 NJAC will be completely transparent and any one can\n                 have access to information that is available with NJAC.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_156\">                 This is a rather sweeping generalisation which obviously\n                 does not take into account the privacy of a person who\n                 has been recommended for appointment, particularly as\n                 a Judge of the High Court or in the first instance as a\n                 Judge of the Supreme Court. The right to know is not a\n                 fundamental right but at best it is an implicit fundamental\n                 right and it is hedged in with the implicit fundamental\n                 right to privacy that all people enjoy. The balance\n                 between the two implied fundamental rights is difficult to\n                 maintain, but the 99th Constitution Amendment Act and\n                 the NJAC Act do not even attempt to consider, let alone\n                 achieve that balance.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_157\">                 954.

At this stage, it is worth recalling the\n                 words of Sir Ninian Stephen, a former Judge of the\n                 High Court of Australia who memorably said:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_184\">                 “[An] independent judiciary, although a formidable\n                 protector of individual liberty, is at the same time a very\n                 vulnerable institution, a fragile bastion indeed.”\n\n                 It is this fragile bastion that needs protection to maintain\n                 its independence and if this fragile bastion is subject to a\n                 challenge, constitutional protection is necessary.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_185\">                 714. The independence of the judiciary takes within its\n                 fold two broad concepts: (1) Independence of an\n                 individual Judge, that is, decisional independence; and\n                 (2) Independence of the judiciary as an institution or an\n                 organ of the State, that is, functional independence. In a\n                 lecture on Judicial Independence, Lord Phillips said:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_186\">                    “In order to be impartial a Judge must be\n                    independent; personally independent, that is free\n                    of personal pressures and institutionally\n                    independent, that is free of pressure from the\n                    State.”\n\n                                   xx          xx            xx\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_187\">                 726. Generally speaking, therefore, the independence\n                 of the judiciary is manifested in the ability of a Judge to\n                 take a decision independent of any external (or\n                 internal) pressure or fear of any external (or internal)\n                 pressure and that is “decisional independence”. It is\n                 also manifested in the ability of the institution to have\n                 “functional independence”. A comprehensive and\n                 composite definition of “independence of the judiciary”\n                 is elusive but it is easy to perceive.”\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_159\">Civil Appeal No. 10044 of 2010 &amp; Ors.                                 Page 103 of 108</span>\n\f                It is clear from the aforesaid quoted passages that the\n\n        independence of the judiciary refers to both decisional and\n\n        functional independence. There is reference to a report titled\n\n        ‘Judicial Independence: Law and Practice of Appointments to the\n\n        European Court of Human Rights’74 which had observed that\n\n        judges are not elected by the people (relevant in the context of\n\n        India and the United Kingdom) and, therefore, derive their\n\n        authority and legitimacy from their independence from political or\n\n        other interference.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_162\">88.     We have referred to the decisions and viewpoints to highlight the\n\n        contentious nature of the issue of transparency, accountability and\n\n        judicial independence with various arguments and counter-\n\n        arguments on both sides, each of which commands merit and\n\n        cannot be ignored. Therefore, it is necessary that the question of\n\n        judicial independence is accounted for in the balancing exercise. It\n\n        cannot be doubted and debated that the independence of the\n\n        judiciary is a matter of ennobled public concern and directly\n\n        relates to public welfare and would be one of the factors to be\n\n\n\n74Contributors: Professor Dr. Jutta Limbach, Professor Dr. Pedro Villalon, Roger Errera, The Rt Hon\nLord Lester of Herne Hill QC, Professor Dr. Tamara Morschakova, The Rt Hon Lord Justice Sedley,\nProfessor Dr. Andrzej Zoll. &lt;http://www.interights.org/document/142/index.html&gt;\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_160\">Civil Appeal No. 10044 of 2010 &amp; Ors.

Thus, when the public interest demands the disclosure of\n\n       information, judicial independence has to be kept in mind while\n\n       deciding the question of exercise of discretion. However, we\n\n       should not be understood to mean that the independence of the\n\n       judiciary can be achieved only by denial of access to information.\n\n       Independence in a given case may well demand openness and\n\n       transparency by furnishing the information. Reference to the\n\n       principle of judicial independence is not to undermine and avoid\n\n       accountability which is an aspect we perceive and believe has to\n\n       be taken into account while examining the public interest in favour\n\n       of disclosure of information.         Judicial independence and\n\n       accountability go hand in hand as accountability ensures, and is a\n\n       facet of judicial independence.        Further, while applying the\n\n       proportionality test, the type and nature of the information is a\n\n       relevant factor. Distinction must be drawn between the final\n\n       opinion or resolutions passed by the collegium with regard to\n\n       appointment/elevation and transfer of judges with observations\n\n       and indicative reasons and the inputs/data or details which the\n\n       collegium had examined. The rigour of public interest in divulging\n\n       the input details, data and particulars of the candidate would be\n\n       different from that of divulging and furnishing details of the output,\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_161\">Civil Appeal No. 10044 of 2010 &amp; Ors.                           Page 105 of 108</span>\n\f       that is the decision. In the former, public interest test would have\n\n       to be applied keeping in mind the fiduciary relationship (if it\n\n       arises), and also the invasion of the right to privacy and breach of\n\n       the duty of confidentiality owed to the candidate or the information\n\n       provider, resulting from the furnishing of such details and\n\n       particulars. The position represents a principled conflict between\n\n       various factors in favour of disclosure and those in favour of\n\n       withholding of information. Transparency and openness in judicial\n\n       appointments juxtaposed with confidentiality of deliberations\n\n       remain one of the most delicate and complex areas. Clearly, the\n\n       position is progressive as well as evolving as steps have been\n\n       taken to make the selection and appointment process more\n\n       transparent and open. Notably, there has been a change after\n\n       concerns were expressed on disclosure of the names and the\n\n       reasons for those who had not been approved. The position will\n\n       keep forging new paths by taking into consideration the\n\n       experiences of the past and the aspirations of the future.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_163\">               Questions referred to the Constitution Bench are accordingly\n\n       answered, observing that it is not possible to answer these\n\n       questions in absolute terms, and that in each case, the public\n\n       interest test would be applied to weigh the scales and on balance\n\n       determine whether information should be furnished or would be\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_162\">Civil Appeal No. 10044 of 2010 &amp; Ors.

Such disclosure would not,\n\n       in any way, impinge upon the personal information and right to\n\n       privacy of the judges. The fiduciary relationship rule in terms of\n\n       clause (e) to <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_309\">Section 8(1)</a> of the RTI Act is inapplicable.

Dr Subramaniam\n\n     Swamy</a>, (1996) 4 SCC 104, it was held as under:</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_188\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_188\">             16. We must have a clear conception of the\n             doctrine. It is well settled that the law permits\n             certain things to be done as a matter of\n             necessity which it would otherwise not\n             countenance on the touchstone of judicial\n             propriety. Stated differently, the doctrine of\n             necessity makes it imperative for the authority\n             to decide and considerations of judicial\n             propriety must yield. It is often invoked in\n             cases of bias where there is no other authority\n             or Judge to decide the issue. If the doctrine of\n             necessity is not allowed full play in certain\n             unavoidable situations, it would impede the\n             course of justice itself and the defaulting party\n             would benefit there from. Take the case of a\n             certain taxing statute which taxes certain\n             perquisites allowed to Judges. If the validity of\n             such a provision is challenged who but the\n             members of the judiciary must decide it. If all\n             the Judges are disqualified on the plea that\n             striking down of such a legislation would\n             benefit them, a stalemate situation may\n             develop. In such cases the doctrine of necessity\n             comes into play. If the choice is between\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_171\">                                    6</span>\n\f             allowing a biased person to act or to stifle the\n             action altogether, the choice must fall in favour\n             of the former as it is the only way to promote\n             decision-making. In the present case also if the\n             two Election Commissioners are able to reach\n             a unanimous decision, there is no need for the\n             Chief Election Commissioner to participate, if\n             not the doctrine of necessity may have to be\n             invoked.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_189\">10. In this light, appellants have to accept the decision of this Court\n\n     which is the final arbiter of any disputes in India and also the\n\n     highest court of constitutional matters.

The recognition of this\n\n      normative democratic ideal requires us to further expound upon\n\n      the optimum levels of accountability and transparency of efficient\n\n      operations of the government.

Firstly, the appellants have contended that the information are\n\n     not held with the Registry of the Supreme Court, rather the Chief\n\n     Justice of India is holding the aforesaid information concerning\n\n     the exchanges between Mr. Justice R. Reghupati and the then\n\n     Chief Justice of India. In this context, the term ‘held’ acquires\n\n     important position. The term ‘held’ usually connotes the power,\n\n     custody, or possession with the person. However, the mandate of\n\n     the Act requires this term to be interpreted wherein the\n\n     association between held and the authority needs to be taken into\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_180\">                                  13</span>\n\fconsideration while providing a meaning for the aforesaid term.\n\nAt this juncture, we need to observe the case of University of New\n\nCastle upon Tyne v. Information Commissioner and British\n\nUnion for Abolition of Vivisection, [2011] UKUT 185 AAC,\n\nwherein the upper tribunal has held as under –\n\n\n          “‘Hold’ is an ordinary English word. In\n          our judgment it is not used in some\n          technical sense in the Act. We do not\n          consider that it is appropriate to define\n          its meaning by reference to concepts\n          such as legal possession or bailment, or\n          by using phrases taken from court rules\n          concerning the obligation to give\n          disclosure of documents in litigation.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_209\">          Sophisticated legal analysis of its\n          meaning is not required or appropriate.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_210\">          However, it is necessary to observe that\n          ‘holding’ is not a purely physical\n          concept, and it has to be understood\n          with the purpose of the Act in mind.</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_211\">          <a href=\"/doc/1979161/\" id=\"a_343\">Section 3(2)(b)</a> illustrates this: an\n          authority      cannot     evade       the\n          requirements of the Act by having its\n          information held on its behalf by some\n          other person who is not a public\n          authority. Conversely, we consider that\n          s.1 would not apply merely because\n          information is contained in a document\n          that happens to be physically on the\n          authority’s premises: there must be an\n          appropriate connection between the\n          information and the authority, so that it\n          can be properly said that the\n          information is held by the authority. For\n          example, an employee of the authority\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_181\">                             14</span>\n\f                         may have his own personal information\n                         on a document in his pocket while at\n                         work, or in the drawer of his office desk;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_212\">                         that does not mean that the information\n                         is held by the authority.”\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_213\">21. From the aforesaid it can be concluded that a similar\n\n          interpretation can be provided for term ‘held’ as occurring under\n\n          <a href=\"/doc/13329432/\" id=\"a_344\">Section 2(j)</a> of the Act. Therefore, in view of the same the term\n\n          ‘held’ does not include following information –\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_214\">                    1. That is, without request or arrangement, sent to or\n                    deposited with a public authority which does not hold itself\n                    out as willing to receive it and which does not\n                    subsequently use it;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_215\">                    2. That is accidentally left with a public authority;\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_216\">                    3. That just passes through a public authority;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_217\">                    4. That ‘belongs’ to an employee or officer of a public\n                    authority but which is brought by that employee or officer\n                    onto the public authority’s premises.1\n\n          Having clarified the aforesaid aspect we are of the opinion that the\n\n          nature of information in relation to the authority concerned\n\n          requires to be seen. The fact that the information sought in the\n\n          instant matter is in custody with the Chief Justice of India as he\n\n          is the administrative head of the Supreme Court, squarely require\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_182\">1</span>\n    Phillip Coppel, Information Rights Law and Practice (4 th Edn.

At the cost of repetition we note that the exemption of right to\n\n     information for confidential information is covered under <a href=\"/doc/1838023/\" id=\"a_348\">Section\n\n     8(1)(d)</a>, exemption from right to information under a fiduciary\n\n     relationship is covered under <a href=\"/doc/1494553/\" id=\"a_349\">Section 8(1)(e)</a> and the exemption\n\n     from private information is contained under <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_350\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the\n\n     RTI Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_224\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_225\">25. The first contention raised by the appellants is that the aforesaid\n\n     information is confidential, therefore the same is covered under\n\n     the exemption as provided under <a href=\"/doc/1838023/\" id=\"a_351\">Section 8(1)(d)</a> of the RTI Act.\n\n     The aforesaid exemption originates from a long time of judge made\n\n     law concerning breach of confidence (which are recently termed\n\n     as misuse of private information).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_226\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_227\">26. Under the classic breach of confidence action, three requirements\n\n     were necessary for bringing an action under this head. These\n\n     conditions are clearly mentioned in the opinion of Megarry, J.,\n\n     in Coco vs. Clark, [1968] FSR 415; wherein, the conditions\n\n     are first, the information itself, i.e. ‘information is required to have\n\n     necessary quality about confidence of the same’; second, ‘the\n\n     information must have been imparted in circumstances importing\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_186\">                                     17</span>\n\f    an obligation of confidence’; third, ‘there must be unauthorized\n\n    use of information which will be detriment to the party\n\n    communicating’.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_228\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_229\">27. Breach of confidence was not an absolute right and public\n\n    interest, incorporated from long time under the common law\n\n    jurisprudence. This defence of public interest can be traced to\n\n    initial case of Gartside v. Outram, (1856) 26 LJ Ch (NS) 113,\n\n    wherein it was held that there is no confidence as to disclosure in\n\n    iniquity. This iniquity was later expanded by Lord Denning\n\n    in Fraser v. Evans, [1969] 1 QB 349, wherein the iniquity was\n\n    referred as merely as an example of ‘justice cause or excuse’ for a\n\n    breach of confidence. This iniquity was widened further in Initial\n\n    Service v. Putterill, [1968] 1 QB 396, wherein it was held that\n\n    iniquity covers any misconduct of nature that it ought to be\n\n    disclosed to others in the public interest. In this line of precedents\n\n    Thomas Ungoed, J., in Beloff v. Pressdram, [1973] 1 All ER 24,\n\n    noted that iniquity would cover ‘any matter, carried out or\n\n    contemplated, in breach of country’s security or in breach of law\n\n    including statutory duty, fraud or otherwise destructive of the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_187\">                                   18</span>\n\f     country or its people and doubtless other misdeeds of similar\n\n     gravity.’\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_230\">28. Eventually the language of iniquity was shaken and discourse on\n\n     public interest took over as a defence for breach of confidence [See\n\n     Lion Laboratories v. Evans, [1985] QB 526]. It would be\n\n     necessary to quote Lord Goff in Her Majesty’s Attorney General\n\n     v. The Observer Ltd. &amp; Ors., [1991] AC 109, wherein he noted\n\n     that “it is now clear that the principle [of iniquity] extends to\n\n     matters of which disclosure is required in public interest”.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_231\">29. The aforesaid expansion from the rule of iniquity to public interest\n\n     defence has not caught the attention of Australian courts wherein,\n\n     Justice Gummow, in Corrs Pavey Whiting and Byrne v.\n\n     Collector of Customs, (1987) 14 FCR 434 and Smith Kline and\n\n     French Laboratories [Australia] Ltd. v. Department of\n\n     Community Services and Health, (1990) 22 FCR 73, reasoned\n\n     that public interest was “picturesque if somewhat imprecise” and\n\n     “not so much a rule of law as an invitation to judicial idiosyncrasy\n\n     by deciding each case on ad-hoc basis as to whether, on the facts\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_188\">                                   19</span>\n\f     overall, it is better to respect or to override the obligation of\n\n     confidence”.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_232\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_233\">30. Even in England there has been a shift of reasoning from an\n\n     absolute public interest defence to balancing of public interest. At\n\n     this   point   we   may   observe   the   case   of Woodward      v.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_234\">     Hutchins,[1977] 1 WLR 760, wherein it was observed “It is a\n\n     question of balancing the public interest in maintaining the\n\n     confidence against the public interest in knowing the truth”.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_235\">31. <a href=\"/doc/1838023/\" id=\"a_352\">Section 8(1)(d)</a> of the RTI Act has limited the action of defence of\n\n     confidentiality to only commercial information, intellectual\n\n     property rights and those which are concerned with maintaining\n\n     the competitive superiority. Therefore, aforesaid section is only\n\n     relatable to breach of confidence of commercial information as\n\n     classically developed. Although there are examples wherein\n\n     commercial confidentiality are also expanded to other types of\n\n     breach of confidential information, however, under <a href=\"/doc/1838023/\" id=\"a_353\">Section 8(1)(d)</a>\n\n     does not take into its fold such breach of confidential information\n\n     actions.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_236\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_189\">                                   20</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_237\">\f32. Coming to other types of confidentiality, we need to note that the\n\n     confidentiality   cannot   be    only   restricted   to   commercial\n\n     confidentiality, rather needs to extend to other types of\n\n     confidentialities as well. [Duchess of Argyll v. Duke of Argyll,\n\n     1967 Ch 302] Under the RTI Scheme such other confidential\n\n     information are taken care under <a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_354\">Section 11</a> of the RTI Act. The\n\n     language and purport under <a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_355\">Section 11</a> extends to all types of\n\n     confidentialities, inclusive of both commercial and other types of\n\n     confidentialities. The purport of this Section is that an\n\n     opportunity should be provided to third party, who treats the\n\n     information as confidential. The ‘test of balancing public interest’\n\n     needs to be applied in cases of confidential information other than\n\n     commercial information as well, under <a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_356\">Section 11</a> of the RTI Act,\n\n     as discussed. In this light, the concerned third parties need to be\n\n     heard and thereafter the authorities are required to pass order as\n\n     indicated herein.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_238\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_239\">33. Further, the appellants have contended that the information\n\n     sought herein relating to the third party are covered under\n\n     exemptions as provided in <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_357\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the RTI Act i.e. private\n\n     information.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_240\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_190\">                                     21</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_241\">\f34. The development from breach of confidence to misuse of private\n\n     information/privacy claim was gradual. There was shift from the\n\n     focus on relationship to whether the information itself had a\n\n     requisite confidential quality [refer to Her Majesty’s Attorney\n\n     General case (supra)]. This shift in focus resulted in the evolution\n\n     of misuse of private information or privacy claim, from its\n\n     predecessor of confidentiality. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"226484\" id=\"span_191\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/226484/\" id=\"a_358\">Campbell v. M.G.N.</a>,\n\n     [2004] UKHL 22, wherein the breach of misuse of private\n\n     information evolved as cause of action. The modification which\n\n     happened in the new cause of action is that the initial confidential\n\n     relationship was not material, which was earlier required under\n\n     the breach of confidence action. The use of term confidential\n\n     information was replaced with more natural descriptive term\n\n     information in private. The change from breach of confidence\n\n     which was an action of equity, to misuse of private information,\n\n     which was a tort provided more structural definitiveness and\n\n     reduced the discretionary aspect.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_242\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_243\">35. The purport of the <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_359\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the RTI Act is to balance\n\n     privacy with public interest. Under the provision a two steps test\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_192\">                                   22</span>\n\f    could be identified wherein the first step was: (i) whether there is\n\n    a reasonable expectation of privacy, and (ii) whether on an\n\n    ultimate balancing analysis, does privacy give way to freedom of\n\n    expression? We should acknowledge that these two tests are very\n\n    difficult to be kept separate analytically.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_244\">\n\nFIRST STEP\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_245\">36. The first step for the adjudicating authority is to ascertain\n\n    whether the information is private and whether the information\n\n    relating the concerned party has a reasonable expectation of\n\n    privacy. In Murray v. Express Newspaper plc, [2009] Ch 481, it\n\n    was held as under\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_194\">             “As we see it, the question whether there is a\n             reasonable expectation of privacy is a broad one,\n             which takes account of all the circumstances of the\n             case. They include the attributes of the claimant,\n             the nature of the activity in which the claimant was\n             engaged, the place at which it was happening, the\n             nature and purpose of the intrusion, the absence\n             of consent and whether it was known or could be\n             inferred, the effect on the claimant and the\n             circumstances in which and the purposes for which\n             the information came into the hands of the\n             publisher.”\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_193\">                                   23</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_246\">\f37. From the aforesaid discussion we can note that there are certain\n\n     factors which needs to be considered before concluding whether\n\n     there was a reasonable expectation of privacy of the person\n\n     concerned. These non-exhaustive factors are;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_247\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_248\">             1. The nature of information.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_249\">             2. Impact on private life.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_250\">             3. Improper conduct.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_251\">             4. Criminality\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_252\">             5. Place where the activity occurred or the information\n             was found.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_253\">             6. Attributes of claimants such as being a public figure, a\n             minor etc and their reputation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_254\">             7. Absence of consent.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_255\">             8. Circumstances and purposes for which the information\n             came into the hands of the publishers.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_256\">             9. Effect on the claimant.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_257\">             10. Intrusion’s nature and purpose.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_258\">\n     These non-exhaustive factors are to be considered in order to\n\n     come to a conclusion whether the information sought is private or\n\n     does the persons has a reasonable expectations of privacy. In\n\n     certain cases we may conclude that there could be certain\n\n     information which are inherently private and are presumptively\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_194\">                                   24</span>\n\f      protected under the privacy rights. These informations include\n\n      gender, age and sexual preferences etc. These instances need to\n\n      be kept in mind while assessing the first requirement under the\n\n      aforesaid test.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_259\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_260\">38.   If the information is strictly covered under the aforesaid\n\n      formulation, then the person is exempted from the right to\n\n      information unless ‘the public interest test’ requires to trump the\n\n      same.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_261\">\nSECOND STEP\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_262\">39.   Having ascertained whether the information is private or not, a\n\n      judge is required to adopt a balancing test to note whether the\n\n      public interest justifies discloser of such information under\n\n      <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_360\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the RTI Act. The term ‘larger public interest’\n\n      needs to be understood in light of the above discussion which\n\n      points that a ‘balancing test’ needs to be incorporated to see the\n\n      appropriateness of discloser. There are certain basic principles\n\n      which we need to keep in mind while balancing the rights which\n\n      are relevant herein.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_263\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_195\">                                   25</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_264\">\f40.   That the right to information and right to privacy are at an equal\n\n      footing. There is no requirement to take an a priori view that one\n\n      right trumps other. Although there are American cases, which\n\n      have taken the view that the freedom of speech and expression\n\n      trumps all other rights in every case. However, in India we cannot\n\n      accord any such priority to the rights.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_265\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_266\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"91938676\" id=\"span_196\">41. The contextual balancing involves ‘proportionality test’. [See <a href=\"/doc/91938676/\" id=\"a_361\">K\n\n      S Puttaswamy v. Union of India</a>, (2017) 10 SCC 1]. The test is\n\n      to see whether the release of information would be necessary,\n\n      depends on the information seeker showing the ‘pressing social\n\n      need’ or ‘compelling requirement for upholding the democratic\n\n      values’. We can easily conclude that the exemption of public\n\n      interest as occurring under <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_362\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> requires a balancing\n\n      test to be adopted. We need to distinguish two separate concepts\n\n      i.e. “interest of the public” and “something in the public interest.”\n\n      Therefore, the material distinction between the aforesaid concepts\n\n      concern those matters which affect political, moral and material\n\n      welfare of the public need to be distinguished from those for\n\n      public entertainment, curiosity or amusement. Under <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_363\">Section\n\n      8(1)(j)</a> of the RTI Act requires us to hold that only the former is an\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_197\">                                    26</span>\n\f      exception to the exemption.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"91938676\" id=\"span_198\">Although we must note that the\n\n      majority opinion in <a href=\"/doc/91938676/\" id=\"a_364\">K S Puttaswamy</a> (supra) has held that the\n\n      data privacy is part of the right to privacy, however, we need to\n\n      note that the concept of data protection is still developing\n\n      [refer Google   Spain     v.        AEPD,    C/131/12;      Bavarian\n\n      Lager v Commission, [2007] ECR II-4523]. As we are not\n\n      concerned with the aforesaid aspects, we need not indulge any\n\n      more than to state that there is an urgent requirement for\n\n      integrating the principles of data protection into the right to\n\n      information jurisprudence.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_267\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_268\">42.   Coming to the aspect of transparency, judicial independence and\n\n      the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_365\">RTI Act</a>, we need to note that there needs to be a balance\n\n      between the three equally important concepts. The whole bulwark\n\n      of preserving our Constitution, is trusted upon judiciary, when\n\n      other branches have not been able to do so. As a shield, the\n\n      judicial independence is the basis with which judiciary has\n\n      maintained its trust reposed by the citizens. In light of the same,\n\n      the judiciary needs to be protected from attempts to breach its\n\n      independence.    Such    interference       requires   calibration   of\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_199\">                                     27</span>\n\f      appropriate amount of transparency in consonance with judicial\n\n      independence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_269\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_270\">43.   It must be kept in the mind that the transparency cannot be\n\n      allowed to run to its absolute, considering the fact that efficiency\n\n      is equally important principle to be taken into fold. We may note\n\n      that right to information should not be allowed to be used as a\n\n      tool of surveillance to scuttle effective functioning of judiciary.\n\n      While applying the second step the concerned authority needs to\n\n      balance these considerations as well.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_271\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_272\">44.

The respondent, in an application dated 23\n\nJanuary 2009 sought copies of the correspondence exchanged between\n\nconstitutional authorities together with file notings, relating to the appointment of\n\nJustice H L Dattu, Justice A K Ganguly and Justice R M Lodha (superseding the\n\nseniority of Justice A P Shah, Justice A K Patnaik and Justice V K Gupta). The\n\nappellant declined to provide the information sought in the application on the\n\nground that the Registry of the Supreme Court does not deal with matters\n\npertaining to the appointment of judges, and appointments of judges to the higher\n\njudiciary are made by the President of India, according to procedure prescribed\n\nby law.

The\n\nappellant declined to transfer the RTI application to the CPIOs of the High Courts\n\non the ground that when the respondent filed the RTI application, he was aware\n\nthat the information with respect to the declaration of assets by the judges of the\n\nHigh Court was available with the High Courts which formed distinct public\n\nauthorities. On 6 January 2009, the CIC held in the second appeal that the\n\ninformation concerning the judges of the Supreme Court was available with its\n\nRegistry and that the appellant represented the Supreme Court as a public\n\nauthority.

The office of the Chief Justice of India is not\n\ndistinct from the Supreme Court of India. The Supreme Court is constituted by\n\nvirtue of the Constitution and consists of judges, of which the Chief Justice is the\n\nhead. This however, does not mean that the Supreme Court and the Chief\n\nJustice are two separate ‗public authorities‘ within the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_443\">RTI Act</a>.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_343\">14.    The term information under <a href=\"/doc/1516599/\" id=\"a_444\">Section 2(f)</a> has been defined broadly to\n\ninclude ―any material in any form‖. The word ‗including‘ denotes the intention of\n\nthe Parliament to provide a non-exhaustive list of materials that fall within the\n\nambit of the sub-clause. The sub-clause includes information relating to any\n\nprivate body ―which can be accessed by a public authority under any law for the\n\ntime being in force‖. The import of this phrase is that information relating to a\n\nthird party is included only where the requisite pre-conditions of any law in force\n\nto access such information is satisfied. The right sought to be exercised and\n\ninformation asked for should fall within the scope of ‗information‘ and ‗right to\n\ninformation‘ as defined under the Act. The information sought must be in\n\nexistence and must be held or under the control of the public authority.\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_243\">                                         17</span>\n\f                                                                                                     PART D\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_344\">15.     <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_445\">Section 8(1)</a> begins with a non-obstante phrase ―Notwithstanding anything\n\ncontained in this Act‖.

Section 2219 contains a non-obstance clause and stipulates that the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_449\">RTI\n\nAct</a> has an overriding effect over laws. The import of this provision is to impart\n\npriority to the salient objectives of the Act and ensure that where information is\n\nheld by or is under the control of a public authority, such information must be\n\nfurnished to the applicant notwithstanding any prohibition in any other law in\n\nforce at that time.

Relevant to the present controversy, is the question whether the decision\n\nof this Court in <a href=\"/doc/112850760/\" id=\"a_453\">S P Gupta v Union of India20</a> is a binding precedent on the\n\nissues raised. Mr Prashant Bhushan, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the\n\nrespondent contended that the points for determination that arise in the present\n\ncase have been answered by the seven judge Bench in S P Gupta where this\n\nCourt ordered the disclosure of the correspondence between the Chief Justice of\n\nIndia, the Chief Justice of Delhi and the Law Minister which concerned the non-\n\nappointment of an additional judge for a full term of two years. Counsel\n\ncontended that this Court held that the public interest in disclosure outweighed\n\nthe potential harm resulting from disclosure and that a free and open democratic\n\nsociety mandated the disclosure of correspondences concerning the appointment\n\nprocess of judges.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_348\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_349\">18.       Opposing the submission, Mr K K Venugopal, learned Attorney General for\n\nIndia appearing on behalf of the appellant, urged that the decision of this Court in\n\nS P Gupta was based on a factually distinguishable situation. The Court <a href=\"/doc/112850760/\" id=\"a_454\">in that\n\ncase</a> was concerned with the disclosure of the correspondence concerning the\n\nappointment process for the purpose of adjudicating the case before it. Moreover\n\nthe judge whose appointment was in issue was a party to the case. The court did\n\nnot address the potential harm to public interest by the disclosure of\n\ncorrespondence in all circumstances. The Attorney General contended that the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_247\">20</span>\n     (1982) 2 SCR 365\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_248\">                                          19</span>\n\f                                                                            PART E\n\n\ndecision assessed the right to know in a passing observation and contrary to the\n\nsubmission of the respondent, it established a restriction on the disclosure of\n\npersonal information.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_350\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_351\">19.    In S P Gupta, this Court was concerned with two issues: (i) the initial\n\nappointment of additional judges and their reappointment on the expiry of their\n\nterms; and (ii) the transfer of High Court judges and the Chief Justices of the High\n\nCourts. Among the issues involved in the proceedings, one concerned the\n\ndisclosure of the correspondence exchanged between the Chief Justice of India,\n\nthe Chief Justice of Delhi and the Law Minister concerning the decision to grant\n\nan extension in the tenure to Justice O N Vohra and Justice S N Kumar as\n\nadditional judges of the Delhi High Court by a period of three months. It was\n\ncontended that Justice O N Vohra should have been appointed as a permanent\n\njudge and that Justice S N Kumar should have been reappointed as an additional\n\njudge for the complete tenure of two years upon the expiry of their initial tenure.\n\nDuring the course of the proceedings, their terms expired and a decision was\n\ncommunicated by the Central Government to not renew their terms. An\n\napplication was filed to contend that the withholding of the re-appointment was\n\nmala fide and unconstitutional. Both former judges were impleaded as\n\nrespondents. While Justice O N Vohra did not appear in the proceedings, Justice\n\nS N Kumar appeared through counsel and contended that the decision of the\n\nCentral Government to not reappoint him for a complete term of two years was\n\nvitiated since it was reached without full and effective consultation with the Chief\n\nJustice of India.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_352\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_249\">                                        20</span>\n\f                                                                                                            PART E\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_353\">20.      The government resisted the disclosure of the correspondence and urged\n\nthat as it formed a part of the advice tendered by the Council of Ministers to the\n\nPresident of India, the court was precluded from ordering disclosure by virtue of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/635602/\" id=\"a_455\">Article 74(2)21</a> of the Constitution. It was also contended that the correspondence\n\nrelated to the ‗affairs of the state‘ and its disclosure was precluded by virtue of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_456\">Section 12322</a> of the Indian Evidence Act 1872.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_354\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_355\">21.      An interim order dated 16 October 1981 ordered the disclosure of the\n\ncorrespondence to the Court. In its final judgment dated 30 December 1981, the\n\nCourt, by a majority, rejected the contention of the Central Government and\n\nupheld the disclosure of the correspondence exchanged between the Chief\n\nJustice of India, the Chief Justice of Delhi and the Law Minister concerning the\n\ndecision to not continue Justice S N Kumar as an additional Judge of the Delhi\n\nHigh Court for another full term.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_356\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_357\">22.      Mr K K Venugopal, learned Attorney General for the Union of India sought\n\nto distinguish the decision in S P Gupta by contending that the order of\n\ndisclosure was made in the specific context of <a href=\"/doc/208203/\" id=\"a_457\">Sections 123</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_458\">16223</a> of the\n\nIndian Evidence Act and in respect of judicial proceedings to which Justice S N\n\nKumar was a party. Hence he urged that the decision does not establish the duty\n\nto disclose the correspondence in all circumstances. Justice S N Kumar had\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_250\">21</span>\n   ―The question whether any, and if so what, advice was tendered by Ministers to the President shall not be\ninquired into in any court.‖\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_251\">22</span>\n    ―123.

The balancing of\n\ninterests <a href=\"/doc/112850760/\" id=\"a_459\">in that case</a> was between the public harm resulting from disclosure and\n\nthe public interest in the administration of justice (by securing complete justice for\n\nthe litigant before the court) which, it is urged, is materially different from the\n\npresent case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_358\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_359\">23.   In S P Gupta, this Court, by an interim order directed the disclosure of the\n\nfile notings only in respect of the non-renewal of the term of Justice S N Kumar.\n\nJustice O N Vohra had chosen to not appear in or participate in the proceedings\n\nbefore the court. As no relief was sought by the latter before the Court, the Court\n\nheld that the correspondence pertaining to him was not relevant to the\n\ncontroversy. Consequently, the Union of India was not required to disclose it.\n\nJustice PN Bhagwati (as he then was) noted the comparably distinct role of\n\nJustice S N Kumar in the proceedings in the following terms:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_217\">             ―58. That takes us to the case of S.N. Kumar which stands on\n             a totally different footing, because S.N. Kumar has appeared\n             in the writ petition, filed an affidavit supporting the writ petition\n             and contested, bitterly and vehemently, the decision of the\n             Central Government not to continue him as an Additional\n             Judge for a further term. Since S.N. Kumar has claimed relief\n             from the Court in regard to his continuance as an Additional\n             Judge, an issue is squarely joined between the petitioners\n             and S.N. Kumar on the one hand and the Union of India on\n             the other which requires to be determined for the purpose of\n             deciding whether relief as claimed in the writ petition can be\n             granted to S.N. Kumar.‖\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_254\">                                                22</span>\n\f                                                                                PART E\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_360\">24.   In its final judgment, the Court first rejected the contention that the\n\ncorrespondence formed part of the advice tendered to the President by the\n\nCouncil of Ministers. The Court noted that while the advice tendered by the\n\nCouncil of Ministers to the President is information protected under <a href=\"/doc/635602/\" id=\"a_460\">Article 74(2)</a>,\n\nthe principal question was whether the correspondence between the Chief\n\nJustice of India, Chief Justice of the Delhi High Court and the Law Minister\n\nformed part of the advice tendered by the Council of Ministers to the President so\n\nas to preclude its disclosure by virtue of <a href=\"/doc/635602/\" id=\"a_461\">Article 74(2).</a> The Court rejected this\n\ncontention and held that any advice tendered by the Council of Ministers would\n\nbe based on the views expressed by the two Chief Justices and their views would\n\nnot form part of the advice tendered. In this view, the material on the basis of\n\nwhich the Council of Ministers formed a view and subsequently tendered the\n\nsame to the President would not constitute advice protected under <a href=\"/doc/635602/\" id=\"a_462\">Article 74(2).</a>\n\nJustice Bhagwati held:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_361\">             ―61…The       advice    is given      by the       Council    of\n             Ministers after consultation with the Chief Justice of the High\n             Court and the Chief Justice of India. The two Chief Justices\n             are consulted on ―full and identical facts‖ and their views are\n             obtained and it is after considering those views that the\n             Council of Ministers arrives at its decision and tenders its\n             advice to the President. The views expressed by the two\n             Chief Justices precede the formation of the advice and merely\n             because they are referred to in the advice which is ultimately\n             tendered by the Council of Ministers, they do not necessarily\n             become part of the advice. What is protected against\n             disclosure under clause (2) or <a href=\"/doc/127060/\" id=\"a_463\">Article 74</a> is only the advice\n             tendered by the Council of Ministers…But the material on\n             which the reasoning of the Council of Ministers is based and\n             the advice is given cannot be said to form part of the advice.‖\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_362\">25.   The Court then proceeded to the claim against disclosure under <a href=\"/doc/208203/\" id=\"a_464\">Section\n\n123</a> of the Indian Evidence Act. It held that where protection from disclosure is\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_255\">                                             23</span>\n\f                                                                                  PART E\n\n\nsought under Section 123 on the ground that the correspondence relates to the\n\naffairs of the state, the court, by virtue of Section 162, is called upon to carry out\n\na balancing task between ―the detriment to the public interest on the\n\nadministrative or executive side which would result from the disclosure of the\n\ndocument against the detriment to the public interest on the judicial side which\n\nwould result from non-disclosure of the document though relevant to the\n\nproceeding‖. It held that the court balances the competing aspects of public\n\ninterest and decides which should prevail in the particular case before it. A claim\n\nfor non-disclosure, in this view, would be sustainable where the disclosure of the\n\ndocument would be injurious to the public interest to a greater degree than the\n\nharm caused to the administration of justice by non-disclosure. Analysing the\n\nclaim in the context of Section 123, Justice Bhagwati noted:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_218\">             ―73. We have already pointed out that whenever an objection\n             to the disclosure of a document under Section 123 is raised,\n             two questions fall for the determination of the court, namely,\n             whether the document relates to affairs of State and whether\n             its disclosure would, in the particular case before the court, be\n             injurious to public interest. The court in reaching its\n             decision on these two questions has to balance two\n             competing aspects of public interest, because the\n             document being one relating to affairs of State, its\n             disclosure would cause some injury to the interest of the\n             State or the proper functioning of the public service and\n             on the other hand if it is not disclosed, the nondisclosure\n             would thwart the administration of justice by keeping\n             back from the court a material document…The court has\n             to decide which aspect of the public interest predominates or\n             in other words, whether the public interest which requires that\n             the document should not be produced, outweighs the public\n             interest that a court of justice in performing its function should\n             not be denied access to relevant evidence.‖\n                                                          (Emphasis supplied)\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_256\">                                              24</span>\n\f                                                                              PART E\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_219\">26.    The Court held that the nature of the proceeding in which the disclosure is\n\nsought, the relevance of the document and the degree of importance that the\n\ndocument holds in the litigation are relevant factors in the balancing process. If\n\nthe correspondence alone would furnish evidence relevant to adjudicating the\n\ndispute before the court, it would be inappropriate to ‗exclude these documents\n\nwhich constitute the only evidence, if at all, for establishing this charge, by saying\n\nthat the disclosure of these documents would impair the efficient functioning of\n\nthe judicial institution.‘ The Court held thus:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_220\">              ―82. …Apart from these documents, there would be no\n              other documentary evidence available to the petitioner to\n              establish that there was no full and effective consultation\n              or that the decision of the Central Government was\n              based on irrelevant considerations … It is only through\n              these documents that the petitioner can, if at all, hope to\n              show that there was no full and effective consultation by the\n              Central Government with the Chief Justice of the High Court,\n              the State Government and the Chief Justice of India or that\n              the decision of the Central Government was mala fide or\n              based on irrelevant grounds and therefore, to accord\n              immunity against disclosure to these documents would be\n              tantamount to summarily throwing out the challenge against\n              the discontinuance of the Additional Judge…The harm that\n              would be caused to the public interest in justice by the\n              non-disclosure of these documents would in the\n              circumstances far outweigh the injury which may\n              possibly be caused by their disclosure, because the non-\n              disclosure would almost inevitably result in the dismissal\n              of the writ petition and consequent denial of justice even\n              though the claim of the petitioner may be true and just.‖\n                                                       (Emphasis supplied)\n\nThe Court held that the potential injury caused by disclosure is outweighed by the\n\npublic interest in justice as the non-disclosure of documents relevant to decide\n\nthe controversy would inevitably lead to the dismissal of the writ petition.

The balancing exercise was between the public harm\n\nresulting from a disclosure of documents relating to the affairs of the state and\n\nthe public interest in the administration of justice. The public interest in the\n\nadministration of justice pertained to the disposal of the case instituted before the\n\ncourt in which the judge was a party.

The Court addressed the contention that the reason for protecting a certain\n\nclass of documents is that they concern decision making at the highest level of\n\ngovernment and only complete freedom from public gaze will enable freedom of\n\nexpression and candour amongst government functionaries. In this view, public\n\nscrutiny was contended to adversely affect the ability of the participants in the\n\ndecision-making process to express their opinion in a free and frank manner. The\n\nCourt, however, rejected the contention that candour and frankness justify the\n\ngrant of complete immunity against disclosures. Justice PN Bhagwati (as he then\n\nwas) addressed the argument founded on candour in the following terms:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_225\">             ―71…The candour argument has also not prevailed with\n             judges.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_226\">             The candour argument has also not prevailed with Judges\n             and jurists in the United States and it is interesting to note\n             what Raoul Berger while speaking about the immunity\n             claimed by President Nixon against the demand for disclosure\n             of the Watergate Tapes, says in his book Executive\n             Privilege”: A Constitutional Myth at page 264:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_227\">                    ―Candid interchange‖ is yet another pretext for\n                    doubtful secrecy. It will not explain Mr. Nixon&#x27;s\n                    claim of blanket immunity for members of his\n                    White House staff on the basis of mere\n                    membership without more; it will not justify\n                    Kleindienst&#x27;s assertion of immunity from\n                    congressional inquiry for two and one-half\n                    million federal employees.

While the Court noted that candour may be a relevant factor to prevent\n\ndisclosure in some circumstances, it expressly rejects its weight as a relevant\n\nfactor when it comes to constitutional functionaries such as the Chief Justice of\n\nIndia and the Chief Justices of the High Courts. Constitutional functionaries are\n\nbound to the oath of their office to discharge their duties in a fair manner in\n\naccordance with the principles enshrined in the Constitution. It cannot be\n\ncountenanced that public gaze or subsequent disclosure will detract an individual\n\nfrom discharging their duty in an effective manner true to the dignity and ethic\n\nassociated with their office.

In this view, the court is not required to assess the effects of the\n\ndisclosure of correspondence in a particular case, as all correspondence of such\n\nnature belongs to a special class which is exempt from disclosure.

He held that participatory democracy is\n\npremised on the availability of information about the functioning of the\n\ngovernment. The right to know as a ―pillar of a democratic state‖ imputes positive\n\ncontent to democracy and ensures that democracy does not remain static but\n\nbecomes a ―continuous process‖.

The above provisions are indicative of the intention of the founders of the\n\nConstitution to create a strong foundation to secure the independence of the\n\njudiciary. This also marked a strong departure from the ‗pleasure doctrine‘ under\n\nthe pre-constitutional colonial framework. <a href=\"/doc/93056159/\" id=\"a_481\">Under the Government of India Act,\n\n1935</a> the judges of the High Court held office during the pleasure of the Crown.\n\nThrough <a href=\"/doc/259647/\" id=\"a_482\">Article 217(1)</a> of the Constitution of India, tenure at the pleasure of the\n\nCrown was substituted with a fixed tenure subject to limited exceptions. Justice\n\nSrikrishna (speaking in non-judicial capacity) elucidates upon the importance of\n\nthis tradition in the following words:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_243\">                 ―A judge of the High Court or Supreme Court is thus not\n                 removable from office except for proved misbehaviour or\n                 incapacity during his tenure of office. The very obviation of\n                 the pleasure doctrine as controlling the tenure of office of a\n                 judge of the High Court or the Supreme Court is explicit of the\n                 intention of the founding fathers to insulate the judges of the\n                 superior courts from the pleasure of the executive. The\n                 several Articles embedded in the Constitution ensure that a\n                 judge is fully independent and capable of rendering justice not\n                 only between citizens and citizens but also between citizens\n                 and the State, without let, hindrance, or interference by\n                 anyone in the State polity. This kind of insulation or immunity\n                 from the pleasure of the executive is essential in view of the\n                 fact that the Constitution has guaranteed several fundamental\n                 rights to the citizens and persons and also empowered the\n                 High Courts and Supreme Court under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_483\">Article 226</a> and <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_484\">32</a> to\n                 render justice against acts of the State.‖30\n\n\n\nIt becomes evident that judicial independence is secured through security over\n\njudicial tenure.

Therefore, he believes that\n\nif judges are free to disregard such ends in their decision making, judicial\n\nindependence serves no purpose. He notes thus:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_250\">                ―Most     thoughtful    scholars     recognize   that   judicial\n                independence is an instrumental value-a means to achieve\n                other ends.

Lorne Sossin argues that transparency is necessary to ensure the public\n\nperception of the judiciary as independent. In the context of judicial\n\nappointments, he believes that appointments may happen on a proper, well-\n\njustified, substantive understanding of judicial ‗merit‘. However, in order for the\n\nsame to be truly independent, they must include within themselves the\n\ntransparency of the criteria and openness of the process. He notes that:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_251\">                  ―What matters most in a democracy, I would suggest, is not\n                  the precise criteria for merit but the transparency of the\n                  criteria, and the authenticity of the reasons for choosing one\n                  individual over another. Merit, in other words, is as much\n                  about process as substance.‖ 36\n\n\nHe then goes on to address how the transparency of criteria and the process is a\n\nlogical extension of the judicial appointment being ‗meritorious‘, and that doing so\n\nwould remove the ‗arbitrariness‘ of the process, leading to upholding of rule of\n\nlaw:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_252\">                  ―We often frame our concern with the rule of law as one\n                  designed to prevent &quot;arbitrary&quot; decisions.

The balance between transparency and confidentiality\n                  is very delicate and if some sensitive information about a\n                  particular person is made public, it can have a far-reaching\n                  impact on his/her reputation and dignity. The 99th\n                  Constitution Amendment Act and the NJAC Act have not\n                  taken note of the privacy concerns of an individual. This is\n                  important because it was submitted by the learned Attorney\n                  General that the proceedings of NJAC will be completely\n                  transparent and any one can have access to information that\n                  is available with NJAC. This is a rather sweeping\n                  generalisation which obviously does not take into account the\n                  privacy of a person who has been recommended for\n                  appointment, particularly as a Judge of the High Court or in\n                  the first instance as a Judge of the Supreme Court. The right\n                  to know is not a fundamental right but at best it is an implicit\n                  fundamental right and it is hedged in with the implicit\n                  fundamental right to privacy that all people enjoy. The\n                  balance between the two implied fundamental rights is difficult\n                  to maintain, but the 99th Constitution Amendment Act and the\n                  NJAC Act do not even attempt to consider, let alone achieve\n                  that balance.‖\n\n\n\nNone of these failings of the specific framework envisaged by the 99th\n\nConstitutional Amendment Act however can be interpreted as a denial of the\n\nimportance of disclosure, transparency and accountability in the context of\n\njudicial appointments or of its constitutionality.

Judicial independence is defined by the existence of conditions which\n\nenable a judge to decide objectively, without succumbing to pressures and\n\ninfluences which detract from the course of justice. To be independent a judge\n\nmust have the ability to decide ‗without fear or favour, affection or ill will‘. The\n\nConstitution creates conditions to secure the independence of judges by setting\n\nout provisions to govern appointments, tenure and conditions of service. These\n\nare provisions through which the conditions necessary to secure judicial\n\nindependence are engrafted as mandatory institutional requirements. These are\n\nintrinsic elements of our constitutional design. But constitutional design must be\n\nrealised through the actual working of its functionaries. Mechanisms which\n\nfacilitate independence are hence a crucial link in ensuring that constitutional\n\ndesign translates into the realisation of judicial independence.

On 21 November 1993, the then Chief Justice of India constituted a\n\nCommittee to draft and circulate a statement on the values that must be reflected\n\nin judicial life. In December 1999, the Conference of Chief Justices of all High\n\nCourts resolved and adopted the Restatement of Values of Judicial Life.

The statement, apart\n\nfrom mentioning 16 values of judicial life concludes that the values enumerated\n\nare not exhaustive but illustrative of what is expected of a judge.

Judicial accountability also stems from the principle that the entrustment\n\nand exercise of power in a constitutional democracy is not unfettered. The\n\nConstitution confers upon judges with the power to dispense justice, which is a\n\nfoundational value in the Preamble to the Constitution.

Adjudicators in robes are human and may be pre-disposed to the failings\n\nthat are inherently human. But the law demands that they must aspire to a\n\nstandard of behaviour that does not condone those failings of a human persona\n\nin the discharge of judicial duties.

To equate the actions of an individual which have no nexus with the\n\ndischarge of official duties as a judge with the institution may have dangerous\n\nportents. The shield of the institution cannot be entitled to protect those actions\n\nfrom scrutiny. The institution cannot be called upon to insulate and protect a\n\njudge from actions which have no bearing on the discharge of official duty. It is\n\nfor this reason that judicial accountability is an inherent component of the justice\n\ndelivery system. Accountability is expected to animate the day to day functioning\n\nof the courts. Judges are required to issue reasoned orders after affording an\n\nopportunity to both sides of a dispute to present their case. Judicial ethic requires\n\nthat a judge ought to recuse herself from hearing a case where there is a\n\npotential conflict of interest. These illustration norms serve to further the\n\ndemocratic ideal that no constitutional functionary is above the rule of law.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_406\">55.   In the view explored above, judicial accountability traces itself from both\n\nthe oath of office and the nature of the judicial power itself. In a broader sense\n\nhowever, there is a significant public interest in ensuring the smooth and efficient\n\nfunctioning of the justice delivery system, consistent with the requirements of\n\njustice in individual cases. The legitimacy of the institution which depends on\n\npublic trust is a function of an assurance that the judiciary and the people that\n\nwork it are free from bias and partiality. Mark Tushnet explores the idea of judicial\n\naccountability in the following terms:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_266\">             ―Under prevailing understandings in liberal democracies, law\n             is a human artefact, so accountability ‗to law‘ must involve\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_306\">                                           51</span>\n\f                                                                                                           PART F\n\n\n                  accountability to someone. Roughly, ‗political accountability‘\n                  refers to accountability to contemporaneous power-holders as\n                  representatives of today‘s people, whereas ‗accountability\n                  to law‘ refers to accountability to the people and their\n                  representatives in the more distant past. Accountability\n                  to law is a form of indirect accountability to the people in\n                  the past, taking its route through their enactments of\n                  law.45\n\n                                                                     (Emphasis supplied)\n\n\nIn this view, accountability is not confined to elected posts. The creation of the\n\nlegal system founded on constitutional precept marked a break from its colonial\n\npast. An independent judiciary is the guardian and final arbiter of the text and\n\nspirit of the Constitution. To ensure this, the Constitution envisages a system of\n\nchecks and balances. <a href=\"/doc/41081345/\" id=\"a_494\">Article 124(4)46</a> of the Constitution stipulates that a judge of\n\nthe Supreme Court may be removed by an order of the President on the ground\n\nof proven misbehavior or incapacity.

Judicial independence does not mean the insulation of judges from the\n\nrule of law. In a constitutional democracy committed to the rule of law and to the\n\nequality of its citizens, it cannot be countenanced that judges are above the law.\n\nThe notion of a responsible judiciary furthers the ideal for which an independent\n\njudiciary was envisaged. It is the exercise of the decision making authority\n\nguaranteed by judicial independence in a just and responsible manner, true to\n\nthe ethos of judicial office that sub-serves the founding vision of the judiciary.\n\nProfessor Stephen Burbank has characterized judicial independence and\n\naccountability as &quot;different sides of the same coin‖.48Professor Charles Gardner\n\nhas stated that:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_268\">                    ―Judicial accountability is yin to the judicial independence\n                    yang. Although some trumpet judicial accountability as if it\n                    were an end in itself, accountability-like independence-is\n                    better characterized as an instrumental value that promotes\n                    three discrete ends: the rule of law, public confidence in the\n                    courts, and institutional responsibility.‖49\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_311\">48</span>\n     Stephen Burbank, The Past and Present of Judicial Independence, California Law Review (1999).\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_312\">49</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_269\">     Charles Gardner, Rescuing Judicial Accountability from the Realm of Political Rhetoric (2006), p .916\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_313\">                                                         53</span>\n\f                                                                            PART F\n\n\nHence, independence and accountability are mutually reinforcing concepts.

The executive in a cabinet form of government in accountable to the\n\nlegislature. Ministers of the government are elected members of the legislature.\n\nCollectively, the government is accountable to the legislature as an institution\n\nand through the legislature to the people. Unlike the elected representatives of\n\nthe people, judges of the district and higher judiciary are not elected. The\n\naccountability which the political process exacts from members of the legislature\n\nis hence distinct from the accountability of judges who are accountable to the\n\ntrust which is vested in them as independent decision makers. Making them\n\naccountable in the discharge of that trust does not dilute their independence. The\n\nindependence of judges is designed to protect them from the pressures of the\n\nexecutive and the legislature and of the organised interests in society which may\n\ndetract judges from discharging the trust as dispassionate adjudicators. Scrutiny\n\nand transparency, properly understood are not placed in an antithesis to\n\nindependence. They create conditions where judges are protected against\n\nunwholesome     influences.   Scrutiny and    transparency are     allies   of   the\n\nconscientious because they are powerful instruments to guard against influences\n\nwhich threaten to suborn the judicial conscience.

The\n                  term also refers to a person who holds a thing in trust for\n                  another (beneficiary). The fiduciary is expected to act in\n                  confidence and for the benefit and advantage of the\n                  beneficiary, and use good faith and fairness in dealing with\n                  the beneficiary or the things belonging to the beneficiary.

A rebuttable presumption arises out of the\n                 inherent purpose of the relationship that one party has a duty\n                 to act in the best interests of the other party. The second,\n                 slightly different use of fiduciary exists where fiduciary\n                 obligations, though not innate to a given relationship, arise as\n                 a matter of fact out of the specific circumstances of that\n                 particular relationship. In such a case the question to ask is\n                 whether, given all the surrounding circumstances, one party\n                 could reasonably have expected that the other party would\n                 act in the former&#x27;s best interests with respect to the subject\n                 matter at issue. Discretion, influence, vulnerability and trust\n                 are non-exhaustive examples of evidentiary factors to be\n                 considered in making this determination. Outside the\n                 established categories of fiduciary relationships, what is\n                 required is evidence of a mutual understanding that one party\n                 has relinquished its own self-interest and agreed to act solely\n                 on behalf of the other party. In relation to the advisory\n                 context, then, there must be something more than a simple\n                 undertaking by one party to provide information and execute\n                 orders for the other for a relationship to be enforced as\n                 fiduciary.‖\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_419\">64.

The words ―held by‖ or ―under\n\nthe control of‖ under <a href=\"/doc/13329432/\" id=\"a_510\">Section 2(j)</a> of the RTI Act will include not only information\n\nunder the legal control of the public authority but also all such information which\n\nis otherwise received or used or consciously retained by the public authority while\n\nexercising functions in its official capacity. The 1997 resolution on declaration of\n\njudge‘s assets as adopted on 7 May 1997 states:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_282\">             ―RESOLVED FURTHER THAT every Judge should make a\n             declaration of all his/her assets in the form of real estate or\n             investments (held by him/her in his/her own name or in the\n             name of his/her spouse or any person dependent on him/her)\n             within a reasonable time of assuming office and in the case of\n             sitting Judges within a reasonable time of adoption of this\n             Resolution and thereafter whenever any acquisition of a\n             substantial nature is made, it shall be disclosed within a\n             reasonable time. The declaration so made should be to the\n             Chief Justice of the Court. The Chief Justice should make a\n             similar declaration for the purpose of the record.

The Chief Justice of India in exercising his official functions in accordance\n\nwith the 1997 resolution while holding asset information of other judges does not\n\nact for and on behalf of other judges of the Supreme Court.

The information is required by the mandate of the\n\nresolution dated 7 May 1997 passed by all the then sitting judges of the Supreme\n\nCourt and it cannot be said that such information is being provided in any\n\npersonal capacity. The Chief Justice of India merely holds the information in\n\naccordance with the official functions and not in any fiduciary capacity. The\n\njudges of the Supreme Court, including the Chief Justice of India occupy a\n\nconstitutional office. There exists no set hierarchies between the judges and they\n\nenjoy the same judicial powers and immunities. The judges who disclose their\n\nassets cannot be said to be vulnerable to and dependent on the Chief Justice of\n\nIndia. In these circumstances, it cannot be held that asset information shared\n\nwith the Chief Justice of India, by the judges of the Supreme Court, are held by\n\nhim in a fiduciary capacity, which if revealed, would result in breach of fiduciary\n\nduty. Therefore, the argument that the information sought is held in a fiduciary\n\ncapacity is inapplicable and cannot be used to prevent the information from being\n\nmade public.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_428\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_429\">70.     While we have not accepted the argument of the appellant regarding the\n\nexistence of the fiduciary relationship between the Chief Justice of India and the\n\njudges, it is relevant to point out the application of the fiduciary principle to public\n\ninstitutions where judges hold citizens‘ interests in public trust, guided by\n\nfiduciary standards.73 A Judge‘s public fiduciary obligation towards the citizen\n\nincludes a duty of loyalty, duty of care and the cluster comprising the duties of\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_350\">73</span>\n   Robert G.

In order to facilitate effective governance, the government or ‗public\n\nauthority‘ must be empowered to efficiently coordinate diverse activities and at\n\nthe same time be constrained to ensure that it does not override the freedoms of\n\nthose it serves. In explaining the system of checks and balances in the American\n\nConstitution, James Madison noted:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_283\">                   ―If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If\n                   angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal\n                   controls on government would be necessary. In framing a\n                   government which is to be administered by men over\n                   men, the great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable\n                   the government to control the governed; and in the next\n                   place oblige it to control itself. A dependence on the\n                   people is, no doubt, the primary control on the government;\n                   but experience has taught mankind the necessity of auxiliary\n                   precautions.‖78\n                                                             (Emphasis supplied)\n\n\nOur Constitution institutes and operationalises the functions of government. It is\n\nnecessary to empower the government to operationalise the public functions of\n\nthe state and ensure the governance of the public lives of citizens. However, the\n\nframers of our Constitution recognised that this act of empowerment also carried\n\ncertain associated risks, that no government of people is infallible and that in\n\naddition to democratic controls, certain additional checks and balances on\n\ngovernmental power are necessary. Part III of the Constitution represents a\n\ncrucial aspect of the constitutional scheme by which governmental power is\n\nrestricted, and the government is obligated to respect the rights and freedoms of\n\ncitizens.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_357\">78</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_284\">     James Madison, Federalist No 51 (1788)\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_358\">                                                  65</span>\n\f                                                                                PART H\n\n\n\nScheme of <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_518\">Sections 8</a> and <a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_519\">11</a>\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_435\">73.   <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_520\">The RTI Act</a> was enacted in furtherance of the principles found in Part III of\n\nthe Constitution. <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_521\">The RTI Act</a> operationalises the disclosure of information held\n\nby ‗public authorities‘ in order to reduce the asymmetry of information between\n\nindividual citizens and the state apparatus. <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_522\">The RTI Act</a> facilities transparency in\n\nthe decisions of public authorities, the accountability of public officials for any\n\nmisconduct or illegality and empowers individuals to bring to light matters of\n\npublic interest. <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_523\">The RTI Act</a> has provided a powerful instrument to citizens: to\n\nindividuals engaged in advocacy and journalism.

Thus, the exemption\n\nunder clause (d) is not absolute but is qualified and cannot be invoked where\n\nthere exists a ―larger public interest‖.

Where disclosure of ‗third party\n\ninformation‘ is sought, and such information has been prima facie treated as\n\nconfidential by the third party in question, the procedure under <a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_551\">Section 11</a> of the\n\nRTI Act is mandatory. The Information Officer shall, within five days of receiving\n\nthe request for ‗third party information‘ notify the relevant third party to whom the\n\ninformation relates or which had supplied it. The notice shall invite the third party\n\nto submit reasons (in writing or orally) as to whether or not the information sought\n\nshould be disclosed. <a href=\"/doc/1567161/\" id=\"a_552\">Section 11(2)</a> provides the third party with a right to make a\n\nrepresentation against the proposed disclosure within ten days of receiving the\n\nnotice. The provision expressly mandates the Information Officer to take into\n\nconsideration the objections of the third party when making a decision with\n\nrespect to disclosure or non-disclosure of the information. It encapsulates the\n\nfundamental idea that a party whose personal information is sought to be\n\ndisclosed is afforded the opportunity to contest disclosure. The proviso to sub\n\nsection (1) of <a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_553\">Section 11</a> permits disclosure where the ―public interest‖ in\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_364\">                                            71</span>\n\f                                                                           PART H\n\n\ndisclosure ―outweighs‖ any possible harms in disclosure highlighted by the third\n\nparty.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_443\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_444\">78.        <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_554\">Sections 8</a> and <a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_555\">11</a> must be read together. Other than in a case where the\n\ninformation applicant seeks the disclosure of information which relates to the\n\ninformation applicant herself, information sought that falls under the category of\n\n―personal information‖ within the meaning of clause (j) of <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_556\">Section 8(1)</a> is also\n\n―third party information‖ within the ambit of <a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_557\">Section 11</a>.

The two provisions create a substantive\n\nsystem of checks and balances which seek to balance the right of the information\n\napplicant to receive information with the right of the third party to prevent the\n\ndisclosure of personal information by permitting the latter to contest the proposed\n\ndisclosure.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_445\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_446\">79.        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1923225\" id=\"span_365\">In <a href=\"/doc/1923225/\" id=\"a_561\">Arvind Kejriwal v Central Public Information Officer79</a> it was\n\ncontended that the procedure for notifying the third party and inviting objections\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_562\">Section 11</a> only applied to situations where the information sought was\n\ndirectly supplied by the third party, and not to situations where the information\n\n‗related to‘ the third party but was not supplied by it.

Similarly, in case information has been provided by\n             the third party and has been prima facie treated by the said\n             third party as confidential, again the procedure under <a href=\"/doc/839514/\" id=\"a_565\">Section\n             11(1)</a> has to be followed.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_306\">             …\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_307\">             15. <a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_566\">Section 11</a> also ensures that the principles of natural\n             justice are complied with.

A third party may\n             have reasons, grounds and explanations as to why the\n             information should not be furnished, which may not be in\n             the knowledge of the PIO/appellate authorities or\n             available in the records. The information seeker is not\n             required to give any reason why he has made an application\n             for information. There may be facts, causes or reasons\n             unknown to the PIO or the appellant authority which may\n             justify and require denial of information.

No democratic\n                Government can survive without accountability and the\n                basic postulate of accountability is that the people\n                should have information about the functioning of the\n                Government.

Privacy\nalso connotes a right to be left alone. Privacy safeguards\nindividual autonomy and recognises the ability of the\nindividual to control vital aspects of his or her life.\nPersonal choices governing a way of life are intrinsic to\nprivacy. Privacy protects heterogeneity and recognises\nthe plurality and diversity of our culture. While the\nlegitimate expectation of privacy may vary from the intimate\nzone to the private zone and from the private to the public\narenas, it is important to underscore that privacy is not lost or\nsurrendered merely because the individual is in a public\nplace. Privacy attaches to the person since it is an essential\nfacet of the dignity of the human being.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_460\">…\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_461\">325. Like other rights which form part of the fundamental\nfreedoms protected by Part III, including the right to life\nand personal liberty under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_604\">Article 21</a>, privacy is not an\nabsolute right. A law which encroaches upon privacy will\nhave to withstand the touchstone of permissible\nrestrictions on fundamental rights. In the context of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_605\">Article\n21</a> an invasion of privacy must be justified on the basis of a\nlaw which stipulates a procedure which is fair, just and\nreasonable.

The\n\nconstitutional protection of privacy encompasses not merely personal intimacies\n\nbut also extends to decisional and informational autonomy.

However, where\n\nthere exists a ‗public interest‘ in the disclosure of the information sought, the test\n\nto be applied by the Information Officer is different. The Information Officer must\n\nevaluate whether the ―larger public interest‖ justifies the disclosure of the\n\ninformation notwithstanding the fact that the information is ―personal information‖.\n\nIn doing so, the Information Officer must balance the privacy interest of the\n\nindividual whose personal information will be disclosed with the right to\n\ninformation of the public to know the information sought. The substantive content\n\nof the terms ―personal information‖ and ―public interest‖ must be informed by the\n\nconstitutional standards applicable to the ‗right to know‘ and the ‗right to privacy‘\n\nas disclosure and non-disclosure under the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_633\">RTI Act</a> directly implicate these\n\nconstitutional rights.

There is no bright line which can be drawn between what\n                    is private and what is not. Use of the term &quot;public&quot; is often a\n                    convenient method of contrast, but there is a large area in\n                    between what is necessarily public and what is necessarily\n                    private. An activity is not private simply because it is not done\n                    in public. It does not suffice to make an act private that,\n                    because it occurs on private property, it has such measure of\n                    protection from the public gaze as the characteristics of the\n                    property, the nature of the activity, the locality, and the\n                    disposition of the property owner combine to afford. Certain\n                    kinds of information about a person, such as information\n                    relating to health, personal relationships, or finances,\n                    may be easy to identify as private; as may certain kinds\n                    of activity, which a reasonable person, applying\n                    contemporary standards of morals and behaviour, would\n                    understand to be meant to be unobserved.

That simple fact has\n                  been obscured by the concession properly made on her\n                  behalf that the newspaper&#x27;s countervailing freedom of\n                  expression did serve to justify the publication of some of\n                  this information.

We have also taken note of\n                  the fact that it was conceded before the learned Single Judge\n                  by the learned counsel for the appellant herein that no larger\n                  public interest is involved in seeking the details of the medical\n                  facilities availed by the individual Judges.

The right to information and the need for transparency in the case of\n\nelected officials is grounded in the democratic need to facilitate better decision\n\nmaking by the public. Transparency and the right to information directly\n\ncontribute to the ability of citizens to monitor and make more informed decisions\n\nwith respect to the conduct of elected officials. Where the misconduct of an\n\nelected representative is exposed to the public, citizens can choose not to vote\n\nfor the person at the next poll. In this manner, the democratic process coupled\n\nwith the right to information facilitates better administration and provides powerful\n\nincentives for good public decision making. In the case of judges, citizens do not\n\npossess a direct agency relationship.

In common law countries, public interest has always been understood to\n\noperate as an interest independent to that of the State. Public interest operates\n\nequally against the State as it does against non-State actors. This is of\n\nsignificance in the context of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_654\">RTI Act</a> as the right to information seeks to bring\n\nabout disclosure of information previously held exclusively by the State. Public\n\ninterest therefore operates as a standalone viewpoint independent of whether the\n\ninterest of the State favours disclosure or non-disclosure. At its core, the\n\nobjective test for ‗public interest‘ is far broader than democratic decision making\n\nand takes into consideration both shared conceptions of the common good in\n\nsociety at any given point and yet recognises that such conceptions are always\n\nthe product of contestation and disagreement, necessitating a robust set of\n\nviewpoints to facilitate the self-fulfilment of the individual and the search for truth.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_488\">100.

Limiting the term ‗public interest‘ to information that allows\n\nindividuals to make better public choices with respect to public officials fails to\n\ntake into consideration the powerful benefits that the dissemination of information\n\nheld by public authorities may have on the development of discourse, private\n\ndecision making and the nourishment of the individual.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_489\">101.

However, over the years several authorities have\n\ngiven shape to the concept of public interest and provided indicative factors that\n\nweigh in favour of the disclosure of information. In an article titled ―Freedom of\n\ninformation and the public interest: the Commonwealth experience‖99 the\n\nauthors lay down several factors that, when found to exist in any given case,\n\nwould weigh in favour of disclosure.

The public interest in disclosure\n\nextends to information which informs political debate and the organisation of\n\n―economic, social and political life‖. There also exists public interest in information\n\nwhich is ―intellectual or educational‖ and furthers the development of the\n\nindividual.

The opinion of Baroness Hale indicates a priority of interests in the\n\ndetermination of whether speech is in the ‗public interest‘ and is deserving of\n\nprotection. However, this Court should caution against such an approach. The\n\nfreedom of expression protects a broad range of ideas, including those that\n\n‗offend, shock and disturb‘. In deciding whether information should be disclosed\n\nin the public interest, it is not for the Court to sit in judgement of society and\n\nmake a determination on whether society would be ‗better off‘ or ‗worse off‘ if the\n\ninformation is disclosed. In the prescient words of Justice Tugendhat: ―It is not for\n\nthe judge to express personal views on such matters, still less to impose\n\nwhatever personal views he might have.‖ 101 It is well established that ‗public\n\ninterest‘ does not amount to what the public may find interesting.

The expression ―public interest‖ has to be\n                   understood in its true connotation so as to give complete\n                   meaning to the relevant provisions of the Act. The\n                   expression ―public interest‖ must be viewed in its strict sense\n                   with all its exceptions so as to justify denial of a statutory\n                   exemption in terms of the Act.

The Court in Bihar Public Service Commission observed that\n\nthe existence of certain exemptions from disclosure under clause (1) of <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_660\">Section 8</a>\n\nwould lead to a narrow reading of the phrase ―public interest‖.

Merely because the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_663\">RTI Act</a> contain certain\n\nrestrictions on the disclosure of information cannot lead to a conclusion that the\n\nphrase ―public interest‖ under the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_664\">RTI Act</a> must be construed narrowly.

I should take this a little further on one point. <a href=\"/doc/1266611/\" id=\"a_682\">Article 8(1)</a>\n                  recognises the need to respect private and family life.\n                  <a href=\"/doc/1444915/\" id=\"a_683\">Article 8(2)</a> recognises there are occasions when intrusion\n                  into private and family life may be justified. One of these is\n                  where the intrusion is necessary for the protection of the\n                  rights and freedoms of others. <a href=\"/doc/664727/\" id=\"a_684\">Article 10(1)</a> recognises the\n                  importance of freedom of expression. But <a href=\"/doc/202193/\" id=\"a_685\">article 10(2)</a>, like\n                  <a href=\"/doc/1444915/\" id=\"a_686\">article 8(2)</a>, recognises there are occasions when protection\n                  of the rights of others may make it necessary for freedom of\n                  expression to give way. When both these articles are\n                  engaged a difficult question of proportionality may arise.\n                  This question is distinct from the initial question of\n                  whether the published information engaged <a href=\"/doc/691208/\" id=\"a_687\">article 8</a> at all\n                  by being within the sphere of the complainant&#x27;s private\n                  or family life.‖\n                                                                (Emphasis supplied)\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_442\">106</span>\n      [2004] UKHL 22\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_443\">107</span>\n      ―ECHR‖\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_444\">                                                   105</span>\n\f                                                                                     PART H\n\n\nThe first question of significance is whether the right to privacy of the person\n\nwhose information is sought is engaged. This approach was subsequently\n\napplied by the Court of Appeal in HRH Prince of Wales v Associated\n\nNewspapers Ltd108. The text of clause (j) of clause (1) of <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_688\">Section 8</a> also\n\narticulates this threshold. For clause (j) to be engaged at the first instance, the\n\ninformation sought must constitute ―personal information‖. This is an inquiry\n\nindependent to the question of how the privacy interest should be balanced with\n\nthe free speech interest.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_506\">111. Where the information sought is ―personal information‖ the court must next\n\nbalance the interest in disclosure or dissemination with the privacy interest at\n\nstake. Baroness Hale in her opinion in Campbell stated:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_365\">                  ―137. It should be emphasised that the ‗reasonable\n                  expectation of privacy‘ is a threshold test which brings the\n                  balancing exercise into play. It is not the end of the story.\n                  Once the information is identified as ‗private‘ in this way, the\n                  court must balance the claimant‘s interest in keeping the\n                  information private against the countervailing interest of the\n                  recipient in publishing it. Very often, it can be expected that\n                  the countervailing rights of the recipient will prevail.\n                  …\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_366\">                  140. The application of the proportionality test is more\n                  straightforward when only one Convention right is in play: the\n                  question then is whether the private right claimed offers\n                  sufficient justification for the degree of interference with the\n                  fundamental right. It is much less straightforward when\n                  two Convention rights are in play, and the proportionality\n                  of interfering with one has to be balanced against the\n                  proportionality of restricting the other. As each is a\n                  fundamental right, there is evidently a ―pressing social\n                  need‖ to protect it.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_367\">                  141. Both parties accepted the basic approach of the Court of\n                  Appeal in In re S [2003] 3 WLR 1425, 1451-1452, at paras 54\n                  to 60. This involves looking first at the comparative\n                  importance of the actual rights being claimed in the\n                  individual case; then at the justifications for interfering\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_445\">108</span>\n      [2006] EWHA Civ 1776\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_446\">                                                  106</span>\n\f                                                                               PART H\n\n\n             with or restricting each of those rights; and applying the\n             proportionality test to each. The parties in this case differed\n             about whether the trial judge or the Court of Appeal had done\n             this, the appellant arguing that the Court of Appeal had\n             assumed primacy for the <a href=\"/doc/492977/\" id=\"a_689\">Article 10</a> right while the respondent\n             argued that the trial judge had assumed primacy for the\n             <a href=\"/doc/691208/\" id=\"a_690\">Article 8</a> right.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_507\">                                                       (Emphasis supplied)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_508\">112. Once the information sought has been identified as ―personal information‖\n\nthe Information Officer must identify the actual rights being claimed in the\n\nindividual case. In setting out the substantive content of ‗public interest‘ and\n\n‗privacy‘ various facets of these concepts have been set out. In any given case,\n\nthe Information Officer must identify the precise interests weighing in favour of\n\n‗public interest‘ disclosure, and those interests weighing in favour of ‗privacy‘ and\n\nnon-disclosure. The Information Officer must then examine the justifications for\n\nrestricting each right and whether they are countenanced under the scheme of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_691\">RTI Act</a> and in law generally. The ground of confidentiality simpliciter is not a\n\nground to restrict the right to information under the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_692\">RTI Act</a> or <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_693\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of\n\nthe Constitution. Lastly, the Information Officer must employ the principle of\n\nproportionality. As observed by Baroness Hale, both the right to privacy and the\n\nright to information are legitimate aims. In applying the principle of proportionality,\n\nthe Information Officer must ensure that the abridgement of a right is not\n\ndisproportionate to the legitimate aim sought to be achieved by enforcing the\n\ncountervailing right.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_509\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_510\">113. Take the example of where an information applicant sought the disclosure\n\nof how many leaves were taken by a public employee and the reasons for such\n\nleave. The need to ensure accountability of public employees is of clear public\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_447\">                                            107</span>\n\f                                                                               PART H\n\n\ninterest in favour of disclosure. The reasons for the leave may also include\n\nmedical information with respect to the public employee, creating a clear privacy\n\ninterest in favour of non-disclosure. It is insufficient to state that the privacy\n\ninterest in medical records is extremely high and therefore the outcome should\n\nbe blanket non-disclosure. The principle of proportionality may necessitate that\n\nthe number of and reasons for the leaves be disclosed and the medical reasons\n\nfor the leave be omitted. This would ensure that the interest in accountability is\n\nonly abridged to the extent necessary to protect the legitimate aim of the privacy\n\nof the public employee.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_511\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_512\">114. Having adverted to the analytical test to be applied by the Information\n\nOfficers in balancing the two interests, it is also worth setting out certain factors\n\nthat should not be considered in such a balancing. Section 11B of the Australian\n\nFreedom of Information Act 1982 lays down certain ‗Irrelevant factors‘ that\n\nshould not be considered in determining whether to disclose information. Section\n\n11B is as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_368\">             ―…Irrelevant factors\n             (4) The following factors must not be taken into account in\n             deciding whether access to the document would, on balance,\n             be contrary to the public interest:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_369\">             (a) access to the document could result in embarrassment to\n             the Commonwealth Government, or cause a loss of\n             confidence in the Commonwealth Government;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_370\">             (b) access to the document could result in any person\n             misinterpreting or misunderstanding the document;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_371\">             (c) the author of the document was (or is) of high seniority in\n             the agency to which the request for access to the document\n             was made;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_372\">             (d) access to the document could result in confusion or\n             unnecessary debate.‖\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_448\">                                            108</span>\n\f                                                                             PART I\n\n\nThe factors set out above are not relevant or permissible restrictions on the right\n\nto information and should not be considered in determining whether or not to\n\ndisclose information under the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_694\">RTI Act</a>. Clause (2) of <a href=\"/doc/1910806/\" id=\"a_695\">Section 6</a> of the RTI Act\n\nprovides that an information applicant need not provide any reason as to why the\n\ninformation is sought. It would not be open for an Information Officer to deny the\n\ndisclosure of information on the ground that the information would lead to\n\nconfusion, embarrassment or unnecessary debate in the public sphere. By\n\nenumerating the grounds on which information may be exempted from the\n\ngeneral obligation to disclose, clause (1) of <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_696\">Section 8</a> negates the notion that\n\ninformation may be withheld on the sole ground of confidentiality.\n</blockquote>\n\n<pre id=\"pre_8\">I     Conclusion\n\n\n115.

The collegium owes its\n\nbirth to judicial interpretation. In significant respects, the collegium is a victim of\n\nits own birth – pangs.        Bereft of information pertaining to both the criteria\n\ngoverning the selection and appointment of judges to the higher judiciary and the\n\napplication of those criteria in individual cases, citizens have engaged the\n\nconstitutional right to information, facilitated by the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_702\">RTI Act</a>.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_377\">If the content of the right and the enforcement of the statute are to possess a\n\nmeaningful dimension in their application to the judiciary – as it must, certain\n\nsteps are necessary. Foremost among them is that the basis for the selection and\n\nappointment of judges to the higher judiciary must be defined and placed in the\n\npublic realm. This is the procedure which is followed in making appointments but\n\nalso in terms of the substantive norms which are adopted while making judicial\n\nappointments. There can be no denying the fact that there is a vital element of\n\npublic interest in knowing about the norms which are taken into consideration in\n\nselecting candidates for higher judicial officer and making judicial appointments.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_378\">Knowledge is a powerful instrument which secures consistency in application and\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_451\">                                             111</span>\n\f                                                                               PART J\n\n\ngenerates the confidence that is essential to the sanctity of the process of judicial\n\nappointments.

However, what needs to be emphasised is that the\n\n  substantive standards which are borne in mind must be formulated and placed\n\n  in the public realm as a measure that would promote confidence in the\n\n  appointments process. Due publicity to the norms which have been\n\n  formulated and are applied would foster a degree of transparency and\n\n  promote accountability in decision making at all levels within the judiciary and\n\n  the government. The norms may also spell out the criteria followed for\n\n  assessing the judges of the district judiciary for higher judicial office.
