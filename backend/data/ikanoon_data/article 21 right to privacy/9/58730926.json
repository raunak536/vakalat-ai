These appeals are directed against order dated 2.7.2009 by  which  the\nDivision Bench of the Delhi High Court allowed the writ  petition  filed  by\nNAZ  Foundation  –  respondent  No.1  herein,  by  way  of  Public  Interest\nLitigation (PIL) challenging the constitutional validity of <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_1\">Section  377</a>  of\nthe Indian Penal Code, 1860 (<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_2\">IPC</a>) in the following terms:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">      “We declare that <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 377</a> IPC, insofar it  criminalises  consensual\n      sexual acts of adults in private, is violative of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_4\">Articles 21</a><a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_5\">, 14</a>  and\n      <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_6\">15</a> of the  Constitution.  The  provisions  of  <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_7\">Section  377</a>  IPC  will\n      continue to govern non-consensual penile non-vaginal  sex  and  penile\n      non-vaginal sex involving minors. By &#x27;adult&#x27; we mean everyone  who  is\n      18 years of age and above. A person below 18 would be presumed not  to\n      be able to consent to a sexual act. This clarification will hold till,\n      of course, Parliament chooses to  amend  the  law  to  effectuate  the\n      recommendation of the Law Commission of  India  in  its  172nd  Report\n      which we believe removes a  great  deal  of  confusion.  Secondly,  we\n      clarify that our  judgment  will  not  result  in  the  re-opening  of\n      criminal cases involving <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 377</a> IPC that  have  already  attained\n      finality.”\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">3.    The Background facts:\n</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">(i)   Respondent No.1 is a Non-Governmental  Organisation  (NGO)  registered\nunder the <a href=\"/doc/1700055/\" id=\"a_9\">Societies Registration Act, 1860</a>  which  works  in  the  field  of\nHIV/AIDS intervention and prevention.  Its work has  focussed  on  targeting\n‘men who have sex with men’ (MSM) or homosexuals or gays in consonance  with\nthe integrationist policy. Alleging that  its  efforts  have  been  severely\nimpaired by the discriminatory  attitudes  exhibited  by  State  authorities\ntowards sexual minorities, MSM, lesbians  and  transgender  individuals  and\nthat unless self respect and dignity is restored to these sexual  minorities\nby doing away with discriminatory laws such as <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 377</a> IPC it  will  not\nbe possible to prevent HIV/AIDS, NAZ Foundation filed  WP(C)  No.  7455/2001\nbefore the Delhi High Court impleading  the  Government  of  NCT  of  Delhi;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_5\">Commissioner of Police, Delhi; Delhi State Aids  Control  Society;  National\nAids Control Organisation (NACO) and Union  of  India  through  Ministry  of\nHome Affairs and Ministry of Health &amp; Family Welfare  and prayed  for  grant\nof a declaration that <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 377</a> IPC to the extent it is applicable to  and\npenalises sexual acts in private between consenting adults is  violative  of\n<a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_12\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_13\">, 15</a><a href=\"/doc/1142233/\" id=\"a_14\">, 19(1)(a)-(d)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_15\">21</a> of the  Constitution.  Respondent  No.1\nfurther prayed for grant of a permanent  injunction  restraining  Government\nof NCT of Delhi  and  Commissioner  of  Police,  Delhi  from  enforcing  the\nprovisions of <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 377</a> IPC in respect of sexual acts in  private  between\nconsenting adults.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_6\">(ii)  Respondent No.1 pleaded that the thrust  of  <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_17\">Section  377</a>  IPC  is  to\npenalise sexual acts which are “against  the  order  of  nature”;  that  the\nprovision  is  based  on  traditional  Judeo-Christian  moral  and   ethical\nstandards and is being used  to  legitimise  discrimination  against  sexual\nminorities;  that  <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_18\">Section  377</a>  IPC  does  not   enjoy   justification   in\ncontemporary Indian society  and  that  the  section’s  historic  and  moral\nunderpinning do not resonate with the historically  held  values  in  Indian\nsociety concerning sexual  relations.  Respondent  No.1  relied  upon  172nd\nReport of the Law Commission which had recommended deletion of  Section  377\nand pleaded that notwithstanding the recent  prosecutorial  use  of  <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_19\">Section\n377</a> IPC, the same is detrimental to people’s  lives  and  an  impediment  to\npublic health due to its direct impact on the  lives  of  homosexuals;  that\nthe section serves as a weapon for police abuse in the  form  of  detention,\nquestioning, extortion, harassment, forced sex, payment of hush money;  that\nthe section perpetuates negative and  discriminatory  beliefs  towards  same\nsex relations and sexual minorities in general; and  that  as  a  result  of\nthat it drives gay men and MSM and sexual minorities  generally  underground\nwhich cripples HIV/AIDS prevention methods. According  to  respondent  No.1,\nSection  377  is  used  predominantly  against  homosexual  conduct  as   it\ncriminalises  activity  practiced  more  often  by  men  or  women  who  are\nhomosexually active. The evidence that  refutes  the  assumption  that  non-\nprocreative  sexual  acts  are  unnatural  includes   socio-scientific   and\nanthropological evidence and also the natural presence of  homosexuality  in\nsociety at large.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_7\">(iii) That private, consensual sexual  relations  are  protected  under  the\nright to liberty under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_20\">Article 21</a> under the privacy and  dignity  claim.  It\nwas further pleaded that <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 377</a> IPC is not a valid  law  because  there\nexists no compelling  State  interest  to  justify  the  curtailment  of  an\nimportant  fundamental  freedom;  that  <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_22\">Section  377</a>  IPC  insofar   as   it\ncriminalises consensual, non-procreative sexual  relations  is  unreasonable\nand arbitrary and therefore violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_23\">Article 14.</a>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_8\">(iv)  Another plea taken by respondent No.1 was that Section 377  creates  a\nclassification between “natural” (penile-vaginal) and  “unnatural”  (penile-\nnon-vaginal)  penetrative  sexual  acts.  The   legislative   objective   of\npenalising unnatural acts has no  rational  nexus  with  the  classification\nbetween natural (procreative) and unnatural  (non-procreative)  sexual  acts\nand is thus violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_24\">Article 14.</a>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_9\">4.    By an order dated 2.9.2004, the  Division  Bench  of  the  High  Court\ndismissed the writ petition  by  observing  that  no  cause  of  action  has\naccrued to respondent No.1 and purely academic issues cannot be examined  by\nthe Court. The review petition filed by respondent No.1 was  also  dismissed\nby the High Court vide order dated 3.11.2004.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_10\">5.    Respondent No.1 challenged both the  orders  in  SLP  (C)  Nos.  7217-\n7218/2005, which were converted to Civil Appeal  No.  952/2006.  This  Court\nallowed the appeal vide order dated 3.2.2006 and remitted the writ  petition\nfor fresh decision by the High Court.  The relevant portions of  that  order\nare reproduced below:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">      “The challenge in the writ petition before the High Court was  to  the\n      constitutional validity of <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 377</a> of the Indian Penal Code, 1860.\n       The High Court, without examining  that  issue,  dismissed  the  writ\n      petition by the impugned order observing that  there  is  no  case  of\n      action in favour of the appellant as the petition cannot be  filed  to\n      test the validity of the Legislation  and,  therefore,  it  cannot  be\n      entertained to examine the academic challenge to the constitutionality\n      of the provision.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">      The learned Additional Solicitor General, if we may  say  so,  rightly\n      submits that the matter requires examination and is not  of  a  nature\n      which ought to have been dismissed on  the  ground  afore-stated.   We\n      may, however, note that the appeal is  being  strenuously  opposed  by\n      Respondent No.6. We are, however, not examining the  issue  on  merits\n      but are of the view that the matter does require consideration and  is\n      not of a nature which could have been dismissed on the  ground  afore-\n      stated. In this view, we set aside the impugned judgment and order  of\n      the High Court and remit Writ Petition (C) No.7455  of  2001  for  its\n      fresh decision by the High Court.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_11\">6.    NACO and the Health Ministry had filed  counter  in  the  form  of  an\naffidavit of Shri M.L. Soni, Under Secretary to  the  Government  of  India,\nMinistry of Health &amp; Family Welfare, National AIDS Control Organisation.  He\noutlined the  strategy  adopted  by  NACO  for  prevention  and  control  of\nHIV/AIDS in India which includes identification of high risk groups and  the\nprovision of necessary tools and  information  for  protection  and  medical\ncare. The deponent averred that National  Sentinel  Surveillance  Data  2005\nestimated that HIV prevalence in “men who have sex with  men”  (MSM)  is  8%\nwhile in general population it is lesser than 1%.   The  MSM  population  is\nestimated at 25 lacs as of January 2006. Shri Soni  also  stated  that  NACO\nhas developed programmes for undertaking targeted  interventions  among  MSM\npopulation and that for prevention of  HIV/AIDS  there  is  a  need  for  an\nenabling environment where  people  indulging  in  risky  behaviour  may  be\nencouraged not to conceal information so that they are provided with  access\nto NACO services.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_12\">7.    On behalf of the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of  India,  Shri\nVenu Gopal, Director (Judicial) filed an affidavit and pleaded that  Section\n377 does not suffer from any  constitutional  infirmity.   Shri  Venu  Gopal\nfurther pleaded that an unlawful act cannot be rendered  legitimate  because\nthe person to whose detriment it acts consents to it; that Section  377  has\nbeen applied only on complaint of a victim and there  are  no  instances  of\narbitrary use or application in situations where the terms  of  the  section\ndo not naturally extend to <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 377</a> IPC; that  <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_27\">Section  377</a>  IPC  is  not\nviolative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_28\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_29\">21</a> of the Constitution. According to Shri  Venu\nGopal, <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 377</a> IPC provides a punishment for unnatural sexual  offences,\ncarnal intercourse against the  order  of  nature  and  does  not  make  any\ndistinction between procreative and non-procreative sex.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_13\">8.    Joint Action Council Kannur and Shri B.P. Singhal,  who  were  allowed\nto act as interveners, opposed the prayer made  in  the  writ  petition  and\nsupported the stand taken  by  the  Government.  Another  intervener,  i.e.,\nVoices Against 377, supported the prayer of respondent  No.1  that   Section\n377 should be struck down on the ground of unconstitutionality.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_14\"> 9.   The Division Bench  of  the  High  Court  extensively  considered  the\ncontentions of the parties and declared that  Section  377,  insofar  as  it\ncriminalises consensual sexual acts of adults in  private  is  violative  of\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_31\">Articles 21</a><a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_32\">, 14</a>  and  <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_33\">15</a>  of  the  Constitution.   While  dealing  with  the\nquestion relating to violation of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_34\">Article 21</a>, the High  Court  outlined  the\nenlarged scope of the right to life and liberty which  also  includes  right\nto protection of one’s dignity, autonomy and  privacy,  the  Division  Bench\nreferred to Indian and foreign judgements, the literature and  international\nunderstanding (Yogyakarta Principles) relating to sexuality  as  a  form  of\nidentity and the global trends in the  protection  of  privacy  and  dignity\nrights of homosexuals and held:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">      “The sphere of privacy  allows  persons  to  develop  human  relations\n      without interference from the outside community or from the State. The\n      exercise of autonomy enables an individual to attain fulfilment,  grow\n      in self-esteem, build relationships of his or her  choice  and  fulfil\n      all  legitimate  goals  that  he  or  she  may  set.  In  the   Indian\n      Constitution, the right to live with dignity and the right of  privacy\n      both are recognised as dimensions  of  <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_35\">Article  21.</a>  <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_36\">Section  377</a>  IPC\n      denies a person&#x27;s dignity and criminalises his or  her  core  identity\n      solely on account of his or her sexuality and thus violates <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_37\">Article 21</a>\n      of the Constitution. As it stands, <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 377</a> IPC denies a gay person\n      a right to full personhood which is implicit in notion of  life  under\n      <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_39\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">      The criminalisation of homosexuality condemns in perpetuity a  sizable\n      section of society and forces them to live their lives in  the  shadow\n      of  harassment,  exploitation,  humiliation,   cruel   and   degrading\n      treatment  at  the  hands  of  the  law  enforcement  machinery.   The\n      Government of India estimates the MSM number at around  25  lacs.  The\n      number of lesbians and transgender is said to be several lacs as well.\n      This vast majority  (borrowing  the  language  of  the  South  African\n      Constitutional Court) is denied “moral full citizenship”. <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_40\">Section  377</a>\n      IPC grossly violates their right to privacy and  liberty  embodied  in\n      <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_41\">Article 21</a> insofar as it criminalises consensual sexual  acts  between\n      adults in private. These fundamental rights had their  roots  deep  in\n      the struggle for independence and, as pointed out by Granville  Austin\n      in “The Indian Constitution – Cornerstone of  A  Nation”,  “they  were\n      included in the Constitution in the hope and expectation that one  day\n      the tree of true liberty would  bloom  in  India”.  In  the  words  of\n      Justice V.R. Krishna Iyer these rights are cardinal to a decent  human\n      order and protected by constitutional armour. The spirit of Man is  at\n      the root of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_42\">Article 21</a>, absent liberty, other freedoms are frozen.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">      A  number  of  documents,  affidavits  and  authoritative  reports  of\n      independent agencies and even judgments of various  courts  have  been\n      brought on record to demonstrate the widespread abuse of  <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_43\">Section  377</a>\n      IPC for brutalizing MSM and gay community persons,  some  of  them  of\n      very recent vintage. If the penal clause is not being enforced against\n      homosexuals engaged in consensual acts within privacy, it only implies\n      that this provision is not deemed  essential  for  the  protection  of\n      morals or  public  health  vis-a-vis  said  section  of  society.  The\n      provision, from this perspective,  should  fail  the  “reasonableness”\n      test.”\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"3119797\" id=\"span_1\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"436241\" id=\"span_2\">10.

The  Minister  of  Justice,  South\nAfrican Constitutional Court 1999 (1)  SA  6,  the  words  of  Dr.  Ambedkar\nquoting Grotius while moving the Draft  Constitution,  Granville  Austin  in\nhis treatise “The Indian  Constitution  –  Cornerstone  of  A  Nation”,  the\nWolfenden Committee Report,  172nd  Law  Commission  of  India  Report,  the\naddress of the Solicitor  General  of  India  before  United  Nations  Human\nRights Council, the opinion of Justice Michael Kirby, former  Judge  of  the\nAustralian High Court and observed:</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">      “Thus popular morality or public disapproval of certain acts is not  a\n      valid justification for restriction of the  fundamental  rights  under\n      <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_46\">Article 21.</a>  Popular  morality,  as  distinct  from  a  constitutional\n      morality derived from constitutional values, is based on shifting  and\n      subjecting notions of right  and  wrong.  If  there  is  any  type  of\n      “morality” that can pass the test of  compelling  state  interest,  it\n      must be “constitutional” morality and not public morality.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">      The argument of the learned ASG that  public  morality  of  homosexual\n      conduct might open floodgates of delinquent behaviour is  not  founded\n      upon any substantive material,  even  from  such  jurisdictions  where\n      sodomy laws have been abolished. Insofar as basis of this argument  is\n      concerned, as pointed out by Wolfenden Committee, it is often no  more\n      than  the  expression  of  revulsion  against  what  is  regarded   as\n      unnatural, sinful or disgusting. Moral indignation, howsoever  strong,\n      is not a valid basis for overriding individuals’ fundamental rights of\n      dignity and privacy. In our scheme of things, constitutional  morality\n      must outweigh the argument of public  morality,  even  if  it  be  the\n      majoritarian view. In Indian context, the latest report (172nd) of Law\n      Commission on the subject instead shows heightened  realization  about\n      urgent need to follow global trends on the issue of  sexual  offences.\n      In fact, the admitted case of Union of India that <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_47\">Section 377</a> IPC  has\n      generally been used in cases of  sexual  abuse  or  child  abuse,  and\n      conversely that it has hardly ever been used in  cases  of  consenting\n      adults, shows that criminalization of adult same- sex conduct does not\n      serve any  public  interest.  The  compelling  state  interest  rather\n      demands  that  public  health  measures  are   strengthened   by   de-\n      criminalization of such activity, so that they can be  identified  and\n      better focused upon.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">      For the above reasons we are unable to accept the stand of  the  Union\n      of India that there is a need for retention  of  <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_48\">Section  377</a>  IPC  to\n      cover consensual sexual acts between adults in private on  the  ground\n      of public morality.”\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_16\">11.   The High Court then  considered  the  plea  of  respondent  No.1  that\nSection 377 is violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_49\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution, referred to  the\ntests  of  permissible  classification   as   also   the   requirements   of\nreasonableness and non-arbitrariness as laid down by  this  Court  and  held\nthat the classification created  by  <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_50\">Section  377</a>  IPC  does  not  bear  any\nrational nexus to the objective sought to  be  achieved.   The  observations\nmade by the High Court on this issue are extracted below:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">      “It is clear that <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_51\">Section 377</a>  IPC,  whatever  its  present  pragmatic\n      application, was not enacted keeping in mind instances of child sexual\n      abuse or to fill the  lacuna  in  a  rape  law.  It  was  based  on  a\n      conception of sexual morality specific to  Victorian  era  drawing  on\n      notions of carnality and  sinfulness.  In  any  way,  the  legislative\n      object of protecting women and children has no bearing  in  regard  to\n      consensual  sexual  acts  between  adults  in  private.   The   second\n      legislative purpose elucidated is that  <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_52\">Section  377</a>  IPC  serves  the\n      cause of public health by criminalizing the homosexual  behaviour.  As\n      already held,  this  purported  legislative  purpose  is  in  complete\n      contrast to the averments in NACO&#x27;s affidavit. NACO  has  specifically\n      stated that enforcement of <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_53\">Section 377</a> IPC  adversely  contributes  to\n      pushing the infliction underground, make  risky  sexual  practices  go\n      unnoticed and unaddressed.  <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_54\">Section  377</a>  IPC  thus  hampers  HIV/AIDS\n      prevention efforts. Lastly, as held earlier,  it  is  not  within  the\n      constitutional competence of  the  State  to  invade  the  privacy  of\n      citizen’s lives or regulate conduct to  which  the  citizen  alone  is\n      concerned solely on the basis of public morals. The criminalization of\n      private sexual relations between consenting adults absent any evidence\n      of serious harm deems the provision&#x27;s  objective  both  arbitrary  and\n      unreasonable. The state interest “must be legitimate and relevant” for\n      the legislation to be non-arbitrary and must be proportionate  towards\n      achieving the state interest. If the objective is  irrational,  unjust\n      and unfair,  necessarily  classification  will  have  to  be  held  as\n      unreasonable. The nature of the provision of <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_55\">Section 377</a> IPC  and  its\n      purpose is to criminalise private conduct of consenting  adults  which\n      causes no harm to anyone  else.  It  has  no  other  purpose  than  to\n      criminalise conduct which fails to conform with the moral or religious\n      views of a section of society. The discrimination severely affects the\n      rights and interests of homosexuals and deeply impairs their dignity.”\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">12.   The High Court took note of the Declaration of Principles of  Equality\nissued by the Equal  Rights  Trust  in  April,  2008.  It  referred  to  the\njudgments in The National Coalition for Gay  and  Lesbian  Equality  v.  The\nMinister of Justice, Lawrence v. Texas, Romer v  Evans,  Vriend  v.  Alberta\nand held:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">      “<a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_56\">Section 377</a> IPC is facially neutral and  it  apparently  targets  not\n      identities but acts, but in its operation  it  does  end  up  unfairly\n      targeting a particular community. The fact is that these  sexual  acts\n      which are criminalised are associated more closely with one  class  of\n      persons, namely, the homosexuals as a class. <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_57\">Section 377</a> IPC  has  the\n      effect of viewing all gay men as criminals. When everything associated\n      with homosexuality is treated as bent, queer, repugnant, the whole gay\n      and lesbian community is marked with deviance and perversity. They are\n      subject to extensive prejudice because what they are or what they  are\n      perceived to be, not because of what they do. The  result  is  that  a\n      significant  group  of  the  population  is,  because  of  its  sexual\n      nonconformity, persecuted,  marginalised  and  turned  in  on  itself.\n      [Sachs, J. in The National Coalition for Gay and Lesbian  Equality  v.\n      The Minister of Justice, para 108].\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"845216\" id=\"span_3\">13.   The High  Court  also  discussed  the  case  of  <a href=\"/doc/845216/\" id=\"a_58\">Anuj  Garg  v.  Hotel\nAssociation of India</a> in detail and  made  reference  to  the  principles  of\nstrict  scrutiny  and  proportionality   review   as   borrowed   from   the\njurisprudence of the US Supreme Court, the Canadian and European Courts  and\nproceeded to observe:</span>\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">      “On a harmonious construction of the two judgments, the Supreme  Court\n      must be interpreted to have laid down that the  principle  of  &#x27;strict\n      scrutiny&#x27; would not apply to affirmative action  under  <a href=\"/doc/5282155/\" id=\"a_59\">Article  15(5)</a>\n      but a measure that disadvantages a vulnerable  group  defined  on  the\n      basis of a characteristic that relates to personal  autonomy  must  be\n      subject to strict scrutiny.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">      Thus personal autonomy is inherent in the grounds mentioned in Article\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1363234\" id=\"span_4\">15. The grounds that are not specified in <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_60\">Article 15</a> but are analogous\n      to those specified therein, will be those which have the potential  to\n      impair the personal autonomy of an individual. This view  was  earlier\n      indicated in <a href=\"/doc/1363234/\" id=\"a_61\">Indra Sawhney v. Union of India</a>, (1992) Supp. 3 SCC 217….</span>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_19\">      As held in Anuj Garg, if a law discriminates on any of the  prohibited\n      grounds, it needs to be tested  not  merely  against  “reasonableness”\n      under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_62\">Article 14</a> but be subject to  “strict  scrutiny”.  The  impugned\n      provision  in  <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_63\">Section  377</a>  IPC  criminalises  the  acts  of   sexual\n      minorities particularly men who have sex with  men  and  gay  men.  It\n      disproportionately impacts them solely on the basis  of  their  sexual\n      orientation. The provision runs counter to the  constitutional  values\n      and the notion  of  human  dignity  which  is  considered  to  be  the\n      cornerstone of our Constitution. <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_64\">Section 377</a> IPC in its application to\n      sexual acts of consenting adults in privacy discriminates a section of\n      people solely on the ground  of  their  sexual  orientation  which  is\n      analogous to prohibited ground of sex. A provision of law branding one\n      section of people as  criminal  based  wholly  on  the  State’s  moral\n      disapproval of that class goes  counter  to  the  equality  guaranteed\n      under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_65\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_66\">15</a> under any standard of review.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"78536\" id=\"span_5\">A constitutional provision must be construed,  not  in  a  narrow  and\n      constricted sense,  but  in  a  wide  and  liberal  manner  so  as  to\n      anticipate and take account of changing  conditions  and  purposes  so\n      that the constitutional provision does not get atrophied or fossilized\n      but remains flexible enough  to  meet  the  newly  emerging  problems.\n      [<a href=\"/doc/78536/\" id=\"a_67\">Francis Coralie Mullin v.

Finally, the High Court elaborated  upon  the  scope  of  the  Court’s\npower to declare a statutory provision invalid, referred  to  the  judgments\nin <a href=\"/doc/554839/\" id=\"a_68\">State  of  Madras  v.

Ltd.  v.\nReserve Bank of India, (1992) 2 SCC 343 and held:</span></span></span>\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">      “It is true that the courts should ordinarily defer to the  wisdom  of\n      the legislature while exercising  the  power  of  judicial  review  of\n      legislation. But it  is  equally  well  settled  that  the  degree  of\n      deference to be given to the legislature is dependent on  the  subject\n      matter under  consideration.  When  matters  of  “high  constitutional\n      importance” such as constitutionally entrenched  human  rights  –  are\n      under consideration, the courts are obliged in discharging  their  own\n      sovereign jurisdiction, to give considerably  less  deference  to  the\n      legislature than would otherwise be the case.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">      In the present case, the two constitutional rights  relied  upon  i.e.\n      &#x27;right to personal liberty&#x27; and &#x27;right to  equality&#x27;  are  fundamental\n      human rights which belong to individuals simply  by  virtue  of  their\n      humanity, independent of any  utilitarian  consideration.  A  Bill  of\n      Rights does not &#x27;confer&#x27; fundamental human rights. It  confirms  their\n      existence and accords them protection.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">      After the conclusion of oral hearing, learned ASG  filed  his  written\n      submissions in which he claimed that the courts have only to interpret\n      the law as it is and  have  no  power  to  declare  the  law  invalid.\n      According to him, therefore, if we were to agree with the  petitioner,\n      we could  only  make  recommendation  to  Parliament  and  it  is  for\n      Parliament to amend the law. We are constrained to  observe  that  the\n      submission of learned ASG reflects rather poorly on his  understanding\n      of the constitutional scheme. It is a  fundamental  principle  of  our\n      constitutional scheme that every organ of the State,  every  authority\n      under the Constitution  derives  its  power  or  authority  under  the\n      Constitution and has to act within the limits of powers. The judiciary\n      is constituted as the ultimate interpreter of the Constitution and  to\n      it is assigned the delicate task of determining what is the extent and\n      scope of the power conferred on each branch of  government,  what  are\n      the limits on the exercise of such power under  the  Constitution  and\n      whether any action of any branch transgresses such limits. The role of\n      the judiciary is to protect the fundamental rights. A modern democracy\n      while based on the principle of majority  rule  implicitly  recognizes\n      the need to protect the fundamental rights of those who may dissent or\n      deviate from the majoritarian view. It is the job of the judiciary  to\n      balance the principles ensuring that the government on  the  basis  of\n      number does not override fundamental rights. After the enunciation  of\n      the basic structure doctrine, full judicial review is an integral part\n      of the constitutional scheme. To quote the words of Krishna  Iyer,  J.\n      “... The compulsion of constitutional humanism and the  assumption  of\n      full faith in life and liberty cannot be so futile or fragmentary that\n      any transient legislative majority in tantrums against any minority by\n      three quick  readings  of  a  Bill  with  the  requisite  quorum,  can\n      prescribe  any  unreasonable  modality  and  thereby   sterilise   the\n      grandiloquent mandate.”\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_22\">15.

Shri  Amarendra  Sharan\nmade the following arguments:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">16.2  That the High Court committed serious error by declaring  <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_74\">Section  377</a>\nIPC as violative of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_75\">Articles 21</a><a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_76\">, 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_77\">15</a> of the  Constitution  insofar  as\nit criminalises consensual sexual  acts  of  adults  in  private  completely\nignoring that the writ petition filed by respondent  no.1  did  not  contain\nfoundational facts necessary for pronouncing  upon  constitutionality  of  a\nstatutory provision.  Learned counsel extensively referred to the  averments\ncontained in the writ petition to show that respondent no.1 had  not  placed\nany tangible material before the High Court to show  that  Section  377  had\nbeen used for prosecution of homosexuals as a class and that few  affidavits\nand unverified reports of some NGOs relied upon  by  respondent  no.1  could\nnot supply basis  for  recording  a  finding  that  homosexuals  were  being\nsingled out for a discriminatory treatment.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">16.3  The statistics incorporated in the affidavit filed on behalf  of  NACO\nwere wholly insufficient for  recording  a  finding  that  <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_78\">Section  377</a>  IPC\nadversely affected control of HIV/AIDS amongst the homosexual community  and\nthat decriminalization will reduce the number of such cases.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">16.4  The High Court is not at all right in observing that <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_79\">Section  377</a>  IPC\nobstructs personality development of  homosexuals  or  affects  their  self-\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\">esteem because that observation is solely based on the reports  prepared  by\nthe academicians and such reports could not be relied upon for  grant  of  a\ndeclaration that the section impugned in the writ petition was violative  of\n<a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_80\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_81\">15</a> of the Constitution.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"993382\" id=\"span_9\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"28818832\" id=\"span_10\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1273177\" id=\"span_11\">In  support  of  these  arguments,\nlearned  counsel  relied  upon  the  judgments  in  <a href=\"/doc/1273177/\" id=\"a_82\">Southern   Petrochemical\nIndustries  v.

They  pointed  out  that  the  section\nimpugned in the writ  petition  includes  the  acts  of  carnal  intercourse\nbetween man and man, man and woman and woman and woman  and  submitted  that\nno Constitutional right vests in a person to indulge in  an  activity  which\nhas the propensity to cause harm and any  act  which  has  the  capacity  to\ncause harm to  others  cannot  be  validated.   They  emphasized  that  anal\nintercourse between two homosexuals is a high risk activity,  which  exposes\nboth the participating homosexuals to the risk of HIV/AIDS and this  becomes\neven grave in case  of  a  male  bisexual  having  intercourse  with  female\npartner who may not even be aware of the activity of her partner and is  yet\nexposed to high risk of HIV/AIDS.  They argued that  <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_86\">Section  377</a>  IPC  does\nnot violate the right to privacy and dignity guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_87\">Article 21</a>  of\nthe Constitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_27\">16.6  That the impugned order  does  not  discuss  the  concept  of  “carnal\nintercourse against the order of nature” and does not  adequately  show  how\nthe section violates the right  to  privacy  and  that  also  the  right  to\nprivacy can be curtailed by following due process of law  and  the  <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_88\">Code  of\nCriminal Procedure</a> prescribes a fair procedure,  which  is  required  to  be\nfollowed before any person charged of committing an  offence  under  <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_89\">Section\n377</a> IPC can be punished.  The right to privacy does not  include  the  right\nto commit any offence  as  defined  under  <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_90\">Section  377</a>  IPC  or  any  other\nsection.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_28\">16.7  That the legislature has treated carnal intercourse against the  order\nof nature as an offence and  the  High  Court  has  not  given  reasons  for\nreading down the section. The presumption  of  constitutionality  is  strong\nand the right claimed should have been directly  violated  by  the  statute.\nIndirect  violation  is  not  sufficient  for  declaring  <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_91\">Section  377</a>   IPC\nviolative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_92\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_93\">, 15</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_94\">21</a> of the Constitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_29\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"43475503\" id=\"span_12\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1857950\" id=\"span_13\">16.8  That <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_95\">Article 21</a> provides  that  the  right  to  life  and  liberty  is\nsubject to procedure prescribed by law.

In Khanu v. Emperor AIR 1925 (Sind),  it was  held  that  the\nmetaphor  ‘intercourse’  refers  to  sexual  relations  between  persons  of\ndifferent sexes where the ‘visiting member’  has  to  be  enveloped  by  the\nrecipient  organization  and   submitted   that   carnal   intercourse   was\ncriminalized because such acts have the tendency to lead to unmanliness  and\nlead to persons not being useful in society.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_31\">16.10 Relying upon the dictionary meanings of the  words  ‘penetration’  and\n‘carnal’, Shri Sharan submitted that any insertion into the  body  with  the\naim of satisfying unnatural lust would constitute carnal intercourse.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_32\">16.11       Assailing the finding of the High Court  that  <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_100\">Section  377</a>  IPC\nviolates <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_101\">Article 14</a>, Shri Sharan submitted that the section does not  create\na clause and applies to both  man  and  woman  if  they  indulge  in  carnal\nintercourse against the order of  nature.   Learned  senior  counsel  argued\nthat if the view expressed by  the  High  Court  is  taken  to  its  logical\nconclusion, any provision could be declared to be violative of  <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_102\">Article  14.</a>\nShri Sharan further argued that no class was targeted  by  <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_103\">Section  377</a>  IPC\nand no classification had been made and, therefore, the finding of the  High\nCourt that  this  law  offended  <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_104\">Article  14</a>  as  it  targets  a  particular\ncommunity known as homosexuals or gays is without any basis.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_33\">16.12       Shri K. Radhakrishnan,  learned  senior  counsel  appearing  for\nintervener in I.A. No.7 – Trust God Missionaries  argued  that  <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_105\">Section  377</a>\nIPC was enacted by the legislature to protect social values and morals.   He\nreferred to Black’s Law Dictionary to show that ‘order of nature’  has  been\ndefined as something pure, as distinguished from artificial  and  contrived.\nHe argued that the basic feature of nature involved organs,  each  of  which\nhad an appropriate place. Every organ in the human  body  has  a  designated\nfunction assigned by nature. The organs work in tandem and are not  expected\nto be abused. If it is abused, it goes against nature. The  code  of  nature\nis inviolable. Sex and food are regulated in society. What  is  pre-ordained\nby nature has to be protected, and man  has  an  obligation  to  nature.  He\nquoted a Sanskrit phrase which translated to “you are dust and  go  back  to\ndust”.  Learned  senior  counsel  concluded  by  emphasising  that  if   the\ndeclaration made  by  the  High  Court  is  approved,  then  India’s  social\nstructure and the institution of marriage  will  be  detrimentally  affected\nand young persons will be tempted towards homosexual activities.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_34\">16.13       Shri V. Giri, learned senior counsel  argued  that  <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_106\">Section  377</a>\nIPC does not classify people into groups but it only describes  an  offence.\nHe submitted that the High Court  made  two  wrong  assumptions:  one,  that\nsexual orientation is immutable and two,  that  sexual  orientation  can  be\nnaturally demonstrated only in a way as contemplated  in  <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_107\">Section  377</a>  IPC.\nLearned senior counsel submitted that what has been criminalized by  <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_108\">Section\n377</a> IPC is just the  act,  independent  of  the  sex  of  people  or  sexual\norientation.  Shri Giri further submitted that sufficient  evidence  is  not\navailable to  support   the  statement  that  <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_109\">Section  377</a>  IPC  helps  with\nHIV/AIDS prevention. He referred to the scientific study  conducted  by  the\nNational Institute of Health on behavioral patterns  and  AIDS  which  shows\nthat HIV/AIDS is higher among MSM.  Learned counsel submitted that same  sex\nis more harmful to public health than opposite sex.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_35\">16.14        Shri  Huzefa  Ahmadi  submitted  that  the  right   to   sexual\norientation can always be restricted  on  the  principles  of  morality  and\nhealth. He referred to the constitutional assembly debates on <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_110\">Article 15</a>  to\nshow that the inclusion of sexual orientation in  the  term  ‘sex’  was  not\ncontemplated by the founding fathers.  Shri  Ahmadi  also  referred  to  the\ndissenting opinion given by Justice Scalia and Justice  Thomas  in  Lawrence\nv. Texas wherein  it  was  stated  that  promotion  of  majoritarian  sexual\nmorality was  a  legitimate  state  interest.   Shri  Ahmadi  stressed  that\nCourts, by their very nature, should not undertake the task of  legislating.\nHe submitted that the Delhi High Court was not clear if it was severing  the\nlaw, or reading it down. He argued that if the language of the  section  was\nplain, there was no possibility of severing or reading it down.  He  further\nargued that, irrespective of the Union Government’s stand, so  long  as  the\nlaw stands on the statute book, there was a  constitutional  presumption  in\nits favour.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_36\">16.15       Shri Purshottaman Mulloli submitted that the data  presented  by\nNACO was fraudulent and manufactured and the disparities and  contradictions\nwere apparent.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_37\">16.16       Shri Sushil Kumar Jain argued that the High  Court  was  not  at\nall justified in  striking down <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_111\">Section 377</a> IPC on the specious  grounds  of\nviolation  of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_112\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_113\">, 15</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_114\">21</a> of the Constitution and submitted  that\nthe matter should have been left to Parliament  to  decide  as  to  what  is\nmoral and what is immoral and whether the  section  in  question  should  be\nretained in the statute book.  Shri Jain emphasized  that  mere  possibility\nof abuse of any particular provision cannot be a  ground  for  declaring  it\nunconstitutional.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_38\">16.17        Shri  Praveen  Aggarwal  argued  that  all  fundamental  rights\noperate in a square of reasonable  restrictions.   There  is  censorship  in\ncase of Freedom of Speech and Expression.  High percentage of  AIDS  amongst\nhomosexuals shows that the act in dispute covered under <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_115\">Section 377</a>  IPC  is\na social evil and, therefore, the restriction on it is reasonable.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_39\">17.         Shri F.S. Nariman, Senior Advocate  appearing  for  Minna  Saran\nand  others  (parents  of  Lesbian  Gay  Bisexual  and  Transgender   (LGBT)\nchildren), led arguments on behalf of the learned counsel who supported  the\norder of the High Court.  Shri Nariman referred to the  legislative  history\nof the statutes enacted in Britain including Clauses  361  and  362  of  the\nDraft Penal Code, 1837 which preceded the enactment of <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_116\">Section  377</a>  IPC  in\nits present form and made the following arguments:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">17.1        Interpretation of Section 377 is  not  in  consonance  with  the\nscheme of the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_117\">IPC</a>, with established principles of  interpretation  and  with\nthe changing nature of society.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">17.2         That  Section  377  punishes  whoever  voluntarily  has  carnal\nintercourse against the  order  of  nature.  This  would  render  liable  to\npunishment- (a) Any person who has intercourse  with  his  wife  other  than\npenile - vaginal intercourse; (b) Any person  who  has  intercourse  with  a\nwoman without using a contraceptive.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">17.3        When the same act is committed by 2 consenting  males,  and  not\none, it cannot be regarded as an offence  when-  (i)  The  act  is  done  in\nprivate; (ii) The act is not in the nature of sexual assault,  causing  harm\nto one of the two individuals  indulging  in  it;  and  (iii)  No  force  or\ncoercion is used since there is mutual consent.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">17.4        Section 377 must be read in light of  constitutional  provisions\nwhich include the “right to be let alone”. The  difference  between  obscene\nacts in private and public is statutorily recognized in <a href=\"/doc/594493/\" id=\"a_118\">Section 294</a> IPC.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">17.5        The phraseology of Section 377 (‘Carnal intercourse against  the\norder of nature’) is quaint and archaic, it should be given a meaning  which\nreflects the era when it was enacted. (1860)\n\n17.6        Section  377  should  be  interpreted  in  the  context  of  its\nplacement in  the  <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_119\">IPC</a>  as  criminalizing  an  act  in  some  way  adversely\naffecting the human body and not an act which is an offence  against  morals\nas dealt with in Chapter XIV. The language of Section 377  is  qua  harm  of\nadverse affection to the body which is the  context  in  which  the  section\nappears. It would have to be associated with sexual assault.  It  is  placed\nat the end of the Chapter XVI (Of Offences affecting  the  human  body)  and\nnot in Chapter  XIV  (Of  Offences  affecting  the  Public  Health,  Safety,\nConvenience, Decency and Morals).\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1866681\" id=\"span_14\">17.7         Chapter   Headings  and  sub  headings  provide  a   guide   to\ninterpreting the scope and ambit of Section 377.

Shri  Shyam  Divan,   learned   senior   counsel   representing\nrespondent No.11-Voices Against 377, made the following arguments:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1879676\" id=\"span_17\">18.1        Section 377 is ultra vires <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_124\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_125\">, 15</a><a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_126\">, 19(1)(a)</a> and  <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_127\">21</a>  of\nthe Constitution inasmuch as it violates the dignity and personhood  of  the\nLGBT community. Sexual rights and sexuality are a part of human  rights  and\nare guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_128\">Article  21.</a>  It  is  scientifically  established  that\nconsensual same sex conduct is not  “against  the  order  of  nature”.  LGBT\npersons do not seek any special rights. They  merely  seek  their  right  to\nequality of not to be criminalized for being who they are. Our  Constitution\ndoes not deny any citizen the right  to  fully  develop  relationships  with\nother persons of the same gender by casting a shadow of criminality on  such\nsexual relationships. Justice Vivian Bose in <a href=\"/doc/1879676/\" id=\"a_129\">Krishna  v.

This Court has developed  great  human  rights\njurisprudence in  cases  concerning  under  trials,  scavengers  and  bonded\nlabourers to interpret the notion of ‘dignity’. The  Delhi  High  Court  has\nexercised its jurisdiction to separate out the offending portion of  <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_130\">Section\n377</a> IPC.  Shri Divan also referred to the  legislative  history  of  <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_131\">Section\n377</a>   IPC  and  argued  that  this  provision   perpetuates   violation   of\nfundamental rights of LGBT persons.  Shri Divan referred to  the  incidents,\nwhich took place at Lucknow (2002 and  2006),  Bangalore  (2004  and  2006),\nDelhi (2006), Chennai (2006), Goa (2007), and Aligarh (2011) to  bring  home\nthe point that LGBT persons have been targeted by the police  with  impunity\nand the judiciary at the grass  route  level  has  been  extremely  slow  to\nrecognize  harassment  suffered  by  the  victims.   He  also  relied   upon\n‘Homosexuality:  A Dilemma in Discourse, Corsini  Concise  Encyclopaedia  of\nPsychology and Behavioural Science’, articles written by Prof. Upendra  Baxi\nand Prof. S.P. Sathe, 172nd Report of the  Law  Commission  which  contained\nrecommendation for deleting <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_132\">Section 377</a> IPC and argued that Section 377  has\nbeen  rightly  declared  unconstitutional  because  it  infringes  right  to\nprivacy and right to dignity.  He relied upon  the  statement  made  by  the\nAttorney General on 22.3.2012 that the Government of  India  does  not  find\nany legal error in the order of the High Court and accepts the  same.   Shri\nDivan further argued that <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_133\">Section 377</a> IPC targets LGBT persons  as  a  class\nand is, therefore, violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_134\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_135\">15</a> of the Constitution.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_43\">19.

The  issue  is\ntherefore whether protection of  the  privacy  is  available  to  consenting\nadults who may indulge in “carnal intercourse against the order of nature”.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">19.4        Section 377  does  not  fulfil  the  just  fair  and  reasonable\ncriteria of substantive due process now read into <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_137\">Article 21.</a>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">19.5        Criminalisation impairs health services for  gay  men  and  thus\nviolates their right to health under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_138\">Article 21.</a>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_38\">19.6        Section 377 is vague and seeks  to  introduce  a  classification\nwhich is not based on rational criteria and the object it seeks  to  advance\nis not a legitimate state object.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_39\">19.7        The history of unnatural offences against the  order  of  nature\nand their enforcement in India during the Mogul time, British time and  post\nindependence, shows that the concept  was  introduced  by  the  British  and\nthere was no law criminalising such acts in India.

It  impacts  them\ndisproportionately as a class especially because it restricts  only  certain\nforms of sexual intercourse that heterosexual persons can  indulge  in.  The\nexpression of homosexual  orientation  which  is  an  innate  and  immutable\ncharacteristic of homosexual persons is criminalised  by  Section  377.  The\nsection ends up criminalising identity and not mere acts as  it  is  usually\nhomosexual or  transgender  persons  who  are  associated  with  the  sexual\npractices proscribed under Section 377 (relied  on  National  Coalition  for\nGay and Lesbian Equality v.

Emperor).\nWhile  the  privacy  of  heterosexual  relations,  especially  marriage  are\nclothed in  legitimacy,  homosexual  relations  are  subjected  to  societal\ndisapproval and scrutiny. The section has  been  interpreted  to  limit  its\napplication to same sex sexual acts (Govindrajulu,  in  re,  (1886)  1  Weir\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_47\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1600938\" id=\"span_18\">382. <a href=\"/doc/1600938/\" id=\"a_139\">Grace Jayamani v.

Sexual intimacy is a core  aspect  of  human  experience  and  is\nimportant to mental health, psychological well being and social  adjustment.\nBy criminalising sexual acts engaged in by homosexual men, they  are  denied\nthis  fundamental  human  experience  while   the   same   is   allowed   to\nheterosexuals. The section exposed homosexual  persons  to  disproportionate\nrisk of prosecution and harassment.

Those who have revealed their  orientation  are  faced  with  shock,\ndenial and rejection  and  some  are  even  pressurised  through  abuse  and\nmarriage to cure themselves. They  are  subjected  to  conversion  therapies\nsuch as electro-convulsive  therapy  although  homosexuality  is  no  longer\nconsidered a disease or a mental disorder but an alternate variant of  human\nsexuality and an immutable characteristic which cannot  be  changed.

The Govt. has committed to addressing the  needs\nof those at the  greatest  risk  of  HIV  including  MSM  and  transgendered\npersons. The risk of contracting HIV through unprotected penile anal sex  is\nhigher than through penile vaginal sex. The HIV prevalence in  MSM  is  7.3%\nwhich is disproportionately higher than in that of  the  general  population\nwhich is less than 0.5%. The prevalence continues to  rise  in  many  States\nand this is because of the stigmatisation  of  the  MSM  population  due  to\nwhich  they  are  not  provided  with  sexual  health   services   including\nprevention services such as condoms. Due to pressure, some  MSM  also  marry\nwomen thus acting as a bridge population. Criminalisation  increases  stigma\nand discrimination and acts as  a  barrier  to  HIV  prevention  programmes.\nSection 377 thwarts health services by preventing collection  of  HIV  data,\nimpeding dissemination  of  information,  forcing  harassment,  threats  and\nclosure upon organisations who work with MSM, preventing supply  of  condoms\nas it is seen as aiding  an  offence;  limits  access  to  health  services,\ndriving  the  community  underground;  prevents  disclosure   of   symptoms;\nincreases sexual violence and harassment against the community; and  creates\nan absence of safe spaces leading to risky sex.

From excluding oral  sex  to  now\nincluding oral sex, anal sex and penetration into artificial  orifices  such\nas folded palms or between thighs by terming them  as  imitative  actors  or\nacts of sexual perversity, the scope has been so broadened that there is  no\nreasonable idea of what acts are prohibited.

This becomes clear when <a href=\"/doc/1952106/\" id=\"a_180\">Article 15(2)</a> is applied  to\ntransgendered  persons  who  identify  as  a  third  gender.  For   example,\nGovernment of India has introduced an option for “others” in the sex  column\nof the  passport  application  form.  This  can  be  achieved  only  if  the\nexpression “sex” is read to be broader than the binary  norm  of  biological\nsex as man or woman. The Constitution is a living  document  and  the  Court\ncan  breathe  content  into  rights.  The  underlying  purpose  against  sex\ndiscrimination is to prevent differential treatment for the reasons  of  non\nconformity with normal or natural sexual or gender roles. Sex relations  are\nintricately tied to gender stereotypes. Accordingly  discrimination  on  the\nground of sex necessarily includes discrimination on  the  basis  of  sexual\norientation. Like gender discrimination,  discrimination  on  the  basis  of\nsexual orientation is directed against an immutable and core  characteristic\nof human personality. Even international law recognises  sexual  orientation\nas being included in the ground “sex”. The  determination  of  impact  of  a\nlegislation must be taken in a contextual manner  taking  into  account  the\ncontent, purpose, characteristics and circumstances of the law. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1964375\" id=\"span_40\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"208970\" id=\"span_41\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"845216\" id=\"span_42\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"102852\" id=\"span_43\">Section  377\ndoes not take into account the differences in individuals in terms of  their\nsexual orientation and makes sexual practices  relevant  to  and  associated\nwith a class of homosexual persons criminal. It criminalises acts which  are\nnormal sexual expressions for homosexual men because they can  only  indulge\nin penetrative acts which are penile non vaginal.  Distinction  based  on  a\nprohibited ground cannot be allowed regardless of how  laudable  the  object\nis.

Shri Ashok Desai, learned senior counsel, who appeared for  Shri\nShyam Benegal argued that <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_185\">Section  377</a>  IPC,  which  is  a  pre-Constitution\nstatute, should be interpreted in a manner which may  ensure  protection  of\nfreedom and dignity of the individuals.  He submitted that the Court  should\nalso take cognizance of changing values and  temporal  reasonableness  of  a\nstatute.  Shri Desai emphasized that the attitude of  the  society  is  fast\nchanging and the acts which were treated as  offence  should  no  longer  be\nmade punitive.  He referred to medical literature to show that sexuality  is\na human condition and argued that it should not be regarded as  a  depravity\nor a sin or a crime.  Learned senior  counsel  submitted  that  in  view  of\n<a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_186\">Section 377</a> IPC which stigmatized homosexuality, not  only  homosexuals  but\ntheir  families  face  stigma  and  discrimination.   He  referred  to   the\nrecommendations made by 172nd Law Commission  Report  for  deleting  <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_187\">Section\n377</a> IPC, the survey conducted by Outlook Magazine giving the  statistics  of\nthe  persons  who  indulged  in  different  sexual  practices,  the  support\nextended by the eminent persons including Swami Agnivesh, Soli  J.

Learned  senior  counsel  further  argued\nthat  <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_189\">Section  377</a>  IPC,  which  applies  to  same  sex  relations   between\nconsenting adults violates the constitutional guarantee  of  equality  under\n<a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_190\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_191\">15</a> and the High Court rightly applied Yogyakarta  principles\nfor de-criminalisation of the section challenged in the writ petition  filed\nby respondent No.1.  He supported the High Court’s decision  to  invoke  the\nprinciple of severability.  Shri Ram Jethmalani, Senior  Advocate,  who  did\nnot argue the  case,  but  filed  written  submissions  also  supported  the\nimpugned order and argued that the High Court did not commit  any  error  by\ndeclaring <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_192\">Section 377</a> IPC as violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_193\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_194\">,  15</a>  and  <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_195\">21</a>  of  the\nConstitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_59\">21.

The learned Attorney General submitted  that  the\ndeclaration granted by the High Court may not result in deletion of  <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_197\">Section\n377</a> IPC from the statute book, but a proviso  would  have  to  be  added  to\nclarify that nothing contained therein shall apply to  any  sexual  activity\nbetween the two consenting adults  in  private.

Shri  P.P.

Learned\nAdditional  Solicitor  General  submitted  that   the   legislature,   which\nrepresents the will of the people has decided not to delete and  it  is  not\nfor the Court to  import the extra-ordinary  moral  values  and  thrust  the\nsame  upon  the  society.   He  emphasized  that  even  after  60  years  of\nindependence, Parliament has not  thought  it  proper  to  delete  or  amend\n<a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_199\">Section 377</a> IPC and there is no warrant for the High Court to have  declared\nthe provision as ultra vires Articles 14,15 and 21 of the Constitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_61\">23.

Every legislation enacted by Parliament or State  Legislature  carries\nwith it a presumption of constitutionality.  This is founded on the  premise\nthat the  legislature,  being  a  representative  body  of  the  people  and\naccountable to them is aware of their needs and acts in their best  interest\nwithin the confines of the Constitution. There is nothing  to  suggest  that\nthis principle would not apply to pre-Constitutional laws  which  have  been\nadopted by the  Parliament  and  used  with  or  without  amendment.  If  no\namendment is made to a particular law it may represent a decision  that  the\nLegislature has taken to leave the law as it is  and  this  decision  is  no\ndifferent from a decision to amend and change the law or enact  a  new  law.\nIn light of this, both pre and post Constitutional laws  are  manifestations\nof the will of the people of India through the Parliament and  are  presumed\nto be constitutional.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_108\">29.   The doctrine of severability  and  the  practice  of  reading  down  a\nstatute both arise out of the principle of presumption of  constitutionality\nand are specifically recognized in <a href=\"/doc/134715/\" id=\"a_233\">Article 13</a> which renders the  law,  which\nis pre-Constitutional to be void only to the extent  of  inconsistency  with\nthe Constitution. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"99090701\" id=\"span_48\">In <a href=\"/doc/99090701/\" id=\"a_234\">R.M.D. Chamarbaugwalla v. The Union of India (UOI</a>)  AIR\n1957 SC 628, a Constitution  Bench  of  this  Court  noted  several  earlier\njudgments on the issue of severability and observed as follows:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_54\">      “The doctrine of severability rests, as will presently be shown, on  a\n      presumed intention of the legislature that if  a  part  of  a  statute\n      turns out to be void, that should not affect the validity of the  rest\n      of it, and that that intention is to be ascertained from the terms  of\n      the statute. It is the  true  nature  of  the  subject-matter  of  the\n      legislation that is the determining factor, and while a classification\n      made in the statute might go far to support a conclusion in favour  of\n      severability, the absence of it does not necessarily preclude it.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_55\">      When a statute is in part void, it will be  enforced  as  regards  the\n      rest, if that is severable from what is invalid. It is immaterial  for\n      the purpose of this rule whether the invalidity of the statute  arises\n      by reason of its subject-matter being outside the  competence  of  the\n      legislature or by reason of its provisions contravening constitutional\n      prohibitions.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_56\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"99090701\" id=\"span_49\">26. That being the position in law, it is now  necessary  to  consider\n      whether the impugned provisions are severable in their application  to\n      competitions of a gambling character,  assuming  of  course  that  the\n      definition of &#x27;prize competition&#x27; in<a href=\"/doc/994266/\" id=\"a_235\"> s. 2(d)</a> is wide enough to include\n      also competitions involving skill to a substantial degree. It will  be\n      useful for the determination of this  question  to  refer  to  certain\n      rules of construction <a href=\"/doc/99090701/\" id=\"a_236\">laid down by</a>  the  American  Courts,  where  the\n      question of severability has been  the  subject  of  consideration  in\n      numerous authorities. They may be summarised as follows:</span>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_57\">      1. In determining whether the valid parts of a statute  are  separable\n      from the invalid parts thereof, it is the intention of the legislature\n      that is the determining factor. The test to be applied is whether  the\n      legislature would have enacted the valid part if it had known that the\n      rest of the statute was invalid. Vide Corpus Juris Secundum, Vol.  82,\n      p. 156; Sutherland on Statutory Construction, Vol. 2, pp. 176-177.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_58\">      2. If the valid and invalid provisions are so  inextricably  mixed  up\n      that they cannot be separated from one another, then the invalidity of\n      a portion must result in the invalidity of the Act in its entirety. On\n      the other hand, if they  are  so  distinct  and  separate  that  after\n      striking out what is invalid, what remains is  in  itself  a  complete\n      code independent of the rest, then it will be  upheld  notwithstanding\n      that the rest has become unenforceable. Vide  Cooley&#x27;s  Constitutional\n      Limitations,  Vol.  1  at   pp.   360-361;   Crawford   on   Statutory\n      Construction, pp. 217-218.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_59\">      3. Even when the provisions which are valid are distinct and  separate\n      from those which are invalid, if they all form part of a single scheme\n      which is intended to be operative as a whole, then also the invalidity\n      of a part will result in the failure of the whole.  Vide  Crawford  on\n      Statutory Construction, pp. 218-219.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_60\">      4. Likewise, when the  valid  and  invalid  parts  of  a  statute  are\n      independent and do not form part of a scheme but what  is  left  after\n      omitting the invalid portion is so thin and  truncated  as  to  be  in\n      substance different from what it  was  when  it  emerged  out  of  the\n      legislature, then also it will be rejected in its entirety.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_61\">      5. The separability of the valid and invalid provisions of  a  statute\n      does not depend on whether the law is enacted in the same  section  or\n      different sections; (Vide Cooley&#x27;s Constitutional Limitations, Vol. 1,\n      pp. 361-362); it is not the form, but the substance of the matter that\n      is material, and that has to be ascertained on an examination  of  the\n      Act as a whole and of the setting of the relevant provisions therein.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_62\">      6. If after the invalid portion is  expunged  from  the  statute  what\n      remains  cannot   be   enforced   without   making   alterations   and\n      modifications therein, then the whole of it must  be  struck  down  as\n      void, as otherwise  it  will  amount  to  judicial  legislation.  Vide\n      Sutherland on Statutory Construction, Vol. 2, p. 194.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_63\">      7.  In  determining  the  legislative  intent  on  the   question   of\n      separability, it will be legitimate to take into account  the  history\n      of the legislation, its object, the title and the preamble to it. Vide\n      Sutherland on Statutory Construction, Vol. 2, pp. 177-178.”\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_109\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"19607639\" id=\"span_50\">30.   Another significant canon of  determination  of  constitutionality  is\nthat the Courts would be reluctant to declare a law invalid or  ultra  vires\non  account   of   unconstitutionality.   The   Courts   would   accept   an\ninterpretation, which would be in favour of  constitutionality  rather  than\nthe one which would render  the  law  unconstitutional.  Declaring  the  law\nunconstitutional is one of the last resorts taken by the Courts. The  Courts\nwould preferably put  into  service  the  principle  of  &#x27;reading  down&#x27;  or\n&#x27;reading into&#x27; the provision to make it effective, workable and  ensure  the\nattainment of the object of the Act.

Some  of\nthe observations made in that judgment are extracted below:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_64\">      “66. If from the impugned memoranda the event of being in service  and\n      retiring subsequent to specified date is severed, all pensioners would\n      be governed by the liberalised pension scheme. The pension  will  have\n      to be recomputed in accordance with the provisions of the  liberalised\n      pension  scheme  as  salaries  were  required  to  be  recomputed   in\n      accordance with the recommendation of the  Third  Pay  Commission  but\n      becoming operative from the specified date. It does  therefore  appear\n      that  the  reading  down  of  impugned  memoranda  by   severing   the\n      objectionable portion would not render the liberalised pension  scheme\n      vague, unenforceable or unworkable.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_65\">      67. In reading down the  memoranda,  is  this  Court  legislating?  Of\n      course &#x27;not&#x27; When we delete basis of classification  as  violative  of\n      <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_240\">Article 14</a>, we merely  set  at  naught  the  unconstitutional  portion\n      retaining the constitutional portion.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_66\">      68. We may now deal with the last submission of the  learned  Attorney\n      General on the point. Said the learned Attorney-General that principle\n      of severability cannot be applied to augment the class  and  to  adopt\n      his words &#x27;severance always cuts down the scope, never  enlarges  it&#x27;.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_111\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"758129\" id=\"span_52\">We are not sure whether there is  any  principle  which  inhibits  the\n      Court from striking down an unconstitutional  part  of  a  legislative\n      action which may have the tendency to enlarge the width  and  coverage\n      of the measure. Whenever classification is held  to  be  impermissible\n      and the measure can  be  retained  by  removing  the  unconstitutional\n      portion of classification, by striking down words of  limitation,  the\n      resultant effect may be of enlarging the class. In such  a  situation,\n      the Court can strike down the words of  limitation  in  an  enactment.\n      That is what is called  reading  down  the  measure.  We  know  of  no\n      principle that &#x27;severance&#x27; limits the scope  of  legislation  and  can\n      never enlarge it.”\n\n\n\n\n      The basis of the practice of reading down was succinctly <a href=\"/doc/148308793/\" id=\"a_241\">laid down  in</a>\n<a href=\"/doc/758129/\" id=\"a_242\">Commissioner of Sales Tax, Madhya Pradesh, Indore and Ors.  v.

For sustaining the presumption  of  constitutionality  the\n      Court may take into consideration matters of common knowledge, matters\n      of common report, the history of the times and may assume every  state\n      of facts which can be conceived it must always be  presumed  that  the\n      Legislature understands and correctly appreciates the need of its  own\n      people and that discrimination, if any, is based on adequate  grounds.\n      It is well settled that courts will be justified in giving  a  liberal\n      interpretation  to  the  section  in  order  to  avoid  constitutional\n      invalidity. These principles have given rise to rule of  reading  down\n      the section if it becomes necessary to  uphold  the  validity  of  the\n      sections.”\n\n      In <a href=\"/doc/1215719/\" id=\"a_243\">Minerva Mills Ltd. and Ors.  v.

The learned Attorney General and the  learned  Solicitor  General\n      strongly impressed upon us that <a href=\"/doc/198382/\" id=\"a_244\">Article 31C</a> should be read down so  as\n      to save it from the challenge of  unconstitutionality.  It  was  urged\n      that it would be legitimate to read into that Article  the  intendment\n      that only such laws  would  be  immunised  from  the  challenge  under\n      <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_245\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_246\">19</a> as do not damage or destroy the basic structure  of\n      the Constitution. The principle of reading down the  provisions  of  a\n      law for the purpose of saving it from a  constitutional  challenge  is\n      well-known. But we find it impossible to accept the contention of  the\n      learned Counsel in this behalf because, to do so will involve a  gross\n      distortion of the principle of reading down, depriving  that  doctrine\n      of  its  only  or  true  rationale  when  words  of  width  are   used\n      inadvertently. The device of reading down is not to be resorted to  in\n      order to save the susceptibilities of the law makers,  nor  indeed  to\n      imagine a law of one&#x27;s liking to have been passed. One must  at  least\n      take the Parliament at its word  when,  especially,  it  undertakes  a\n      constitutional amendment.”\n\n\n\n      This was further clarified in <a href=\"/doc/268805/\" id=\"a_247\">Delhi Transport  Corporation  v.  D.T.C.\nMazdoor Congress and  Ors.</a>  1991  Supp  (1)  SCC  600.   In  his  concurring\nopinion, Ray, J. observed:</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_69\">      “On a proper consideration of the cases cited hereinbefore as well  as\n      the observations of Seervai in his book &#x27;Constitutional Law of  India&#x27;\n      and also the meaning that has been given  in  the  Australian  Federal\n      Constitutional Law by Coin Howard, it is clear and apparent that where\n      any term has been used in the Act which per se  seems  to  be  without\n      jurisdiction but can be read down in order to make it constitutionally\n      valid by separating and excluding the part  which  is  invalid  or  by\n      interpreting  the  word  in  such  a  fashion  in  order  to  make  it\n      constitutionally valid and  within  jurisdiction  of  the  legislature\n      which passed the said enactment by reading down the provisions of  the\n      Act. This, however, does not under any circumstances mean  that  where\n      the plain and literal meaning that follows from a bare reading of  the\n      provisions of the Act, Rule or Regulation that it  confers  arbitrary,\n      uncancalised, unbridled, unrestricted power to terminate the  services\n      of a permanent employee without recording any reasons for the same and\n      without adhering to the principles of  natural  justice  and  equality\n      before the law as envisaged in <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_248\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution,  cannot\n      be read down to save the said provision from constitutional invalidity\n      by bringing or adding words in the said  legislation  such  as  saying\n      that it implies that reasons for the order of termination have  to  be\n      recorded. In  interpreting  the  provisions  of  an  Act,  it  is  not\n      permissible where the plain language of the provision  gives  a  clear\n      and unambiguous  meaning  can  be  interpreted  by  reading  down  and\n      presuming certain expressions in order to save it from  constitutional\n      invalidity.”\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_112\">31.   From the above  noted  judgments,  the  following  principles  can  be\nculled out:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_70\">(i)   The High Court and Supreme Court of India are empowered to declare  as\n      void  any  law,  whether  enacted  prior  to  the  enactment  of   the\n      Constitution or after. Such power can be exercised to  the  extent  of\n      inconsistency with the Constitution/contravention of Part III.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_71\">(ii)  There is a presumption of constitutionality in  favour  of  all  laws,\n      including pre-Constitutional laws as the Parliament, in  its  capacity\n      as the representative of the people, is deemed to act for the  benefit\n      of the people in light of their  needs  and  the  constraints  of  the\n      Constitution.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_72\"> iii) The doctrine of severability seeks to ensure that only  that  portion\n      of the law which is unconstitutional is so declared and the remainder\n      is saved. This doctrine should be applied keeping in mind the  scheme\n      and purpose of the law and  the  intention  of  the  Legislature  and\n      should be avoided where the two portions are inextricably mixed  with\n      one another.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_73\">  iv) The court can resort to reading down a law in order to save  it  from\n      being rendered unconstitutional. But while doing so, it cannot change\n      the essence of the law and create a new law which in its  opinion  is\n      more desirable.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_113\">32.   Applying the afore-stated principles to the case in hand, we deem  it\nproper to observe that while the High Court and this Court are empowered to\nreview the constitutionality of <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_249\">Section 377</a> IPC and strike it down  to  the\nextent of its inconsistency with the Constitution, self restraint  must  be\nexercised  and  the  analysis  must  be  guided  by  the   presumption   of\nconstitutionality. After the  adoption  of  the  <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_250\">IPC</a>  in  1950,  around  30\namendments have been made to the statute, the most  recent  being  in  2013\nwhich specifically deals with sexual offences, a category to which  <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_251\">Section\n377</a> IPC belongs. The 172nd Law Commission Report  specifically  recommended\ndeletion of that section and the issue has repeatedly come up  for  debate.\nHowever, the Legislature has chosen not to amend the  law  or  revisit  it.\nThis shows that Parliament, which is undisputedly the  representative  body\nof the people of India has not thought it proper to delete  the  provision.\nSuch a conclusion is further strengthened by  the  fact  that  despite  the\ndecision of the Union of India to not challenge in appeal the order of  the\nDelhi High Court, the Parliament has not made any  amendment  in  the  law.\nWhile this does not make the law immune from constitutional  challenge,  it\nmust nonetheless guide our understanding of  character,  scope,  ambit  and\nimport.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_114\">33.   It is, therefore, apposite to say that unless a clear  constitutional\nviolation is proved, this Court is not  empowered  to  strike  down  a  law\nmerely by virtue of its falling  into  disuse  or  the  perception  of  the\nsociety having changed as regards the legitimacy of  its  purpose  and  its\nneed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_115\">34.

He  therefore  voluntarily  did\nthe act in question by putting his male organ in the mouth of  the  boy  and\nthere was also seminal discharge and the  boy  had  to  vomit  it  out.  The\nquestion that  arose  for  consideration  therein  was  as  to  whether  the\ninsertion of the male organ by the second accused into the  orifice  of  the\nmouth of the boy amounted to an offence under <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_270\">Section 377</a> IPC.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_134\">      The act was the actual replacement  of  desire  of  coitus  and  would\namount to an offence punishable under Section 377.

But, at the same  time\nit could be said without any hesitation of contradiction  that  the  orifice\nof  mouth  is  not,  according  to  nature,  meant  for  sexual  or   carnal\nintercourse. Viewing from that aspect, it could be said  that  this  act  of\nputting a  male-organ  in  the  mouth  of  a  victim  for  the  purposes  of\nsatisfying sexual appetite would be an act  of  carnal  intercourse  against\nthe order of nature.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_137\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"910305\" id=\"span_61\">In <a href=\"/doc/910305/\" id=\"a_271\">State of Kerala v.

The counsel of  the  respondents  contends  (in\n      this argument the Public Prosecutor also supports him) that sexual act\n      between the thighs is  not  intercourse.  The  argument  is  that  for\n      intercourse there must be encirclement of the male organ by the  organ\n      visited; and that in the case of sexual act between the thighs,  there\n      is no possibility of penetration.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_115\">      19.

Here  also  there  is  the  temporary\n      visitation of one organism by a member of the other organization,  for\n      certain clearly defined and limited objects. The primary object of the\n      visiting organization is to obtain euphoria by means of  a  detent  of\n      the  nerves  consequent  on  the  sexual  crisis.

In intercourse between the  thighs,\n      the visiting male  organ  is  enveloped  at  least  partially  by  the\n      organism visited, the thighs: the thighs are kept together and tight.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_120\">      20. Then about penetration. The word &#x27;penetrate&#x27; means in the  concise\n      Oxford Dictionary &#x27;find access into or through,  pass  through.&#x27;  When\n      the male organ is inserted between the thighs kept together and tight,\n      is there no penetration? The word &#x27;insert&#x27; means place, fit,  thrust.&#x27;\n      Therefore, if the male organ is &#x27;inserted&#x27;  or  &#x27;thrust&#x27;  between  the\n      thighs, there is &#x27;penetration&#x27; to constitute unnatural offence.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_121\">      21. Unnatural offence is defined in Section 377  of  the  Penal  Code;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_138\">      whoever voluntarily has carnal intercourse against the order of nature\n      with any man, woman or animal commits unnatural offence.  The  act  of\n      committing  intercourse  between  the  thighs  is  carnal  intercourse\n      against the order  of  nature.  Therefore  committing  intercourse  by\n      inserting the male organ between the thighs of another is an unnatural\n      offence. In this connection, it may be noted that the act  in  Section\n      376 is &quot;sexual intercourse&quot; and the  act  in  Section  377  is  carnal\n      intercourse against the order of nature.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_139\">      22. The position in English law on this question has been  brought  to\n      my notice. The old decision of Rex v. Samuel Jacobs (1817) Russ  &amp;  Ry\n      381 CCE lays down that penetration through the mouth does  not  amount\n      to the offence of sodomy under  English  law.  The  counsel  therefore\n      argues that sexual intercourse between the thighs cannot  also  be  an\n      offence under Section 377 of the Penal Code. In Sirkar v. Gula Mythien\n      Pillai Chaithu Maho. mathu 1908 TLR Vol XIV Appendix 43 a  Full  Bench\n      of the Travancore High Court held that having connection with a person\n      in the mouth was an offence under Section 377 of the Penal Code. In  a\n      short judgment, the learned Judges held that  it  was  unnecessary  to\n      refer to English Statute Law and English text  books  which  proceeded\n      upon an interpretation of the words sodomy,  buggery  and  bestiality;\n      and that the words used in the Penal Code were very aim pie  and  died\n      enough to include all acts against the order of nature. My view on the\n      question is also that the words of Section 377  are  simple  and  wide\n      enough to include any carnal intercourse again tithe order  of  nature\n      within its ambit. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1880919\" id=\"span_62\">Committing intercourse between the thighs of another\n      is carnal intercourse against the order of nature.”\n\n\n\n\nIn <a href=\"/doc/1880919/\" id=\"a_272\">Fazal Rab Choudhary v.

Other authorities, however, have  taken  a  contrary\n      view, holding that the words used in the statute are  limited  by  the\n      common law definition of the crime where  the  words  of  the  statute\n      themselves are not explicit as to what shall be included.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_128\">      It is competent for the legislature  to  declare  that  the  doing  of\n      certain acts shall constitute the  crime  against  nature  even-though\n      they would not have constituted that crime  at  common  law,  and  the\n      statutory crime against nature  is  not  necessarily  limited  to  the\n      common law crime of sodomy, but  in  imposing  a  punishment  for  the\n      common law crime it is not necessary for the legislature to specify in\n      the statute the particular acts which shall constitute the crime.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_129\">      Under statutes providing that whoever has  carnal  copulation  with  a\n      beast, or in any opening  of  the  body,  except  sexual  parts,  with\n      another being, shall be guilty of sodomy, it has been  held  that  the\n      act of cunnilingus is not a crime, but that taking the male sex  organ\n      into the mouth is sodomy. On the other hand, under such a  statute  it\n      has been held that the crime of sodomy cannot be committed unless  the\n      sexual organ of accused is involved, but there is  also  authority  to\n      the contrary. Under a statute defining sodomy as the carnal  knowledge\n      and connection against the order of nature by man with man, or in  the\n      same unnatural manner with woman, it has  been  held  that  the  crime\n      cannot be committed by woman with woman.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_130\">      A statute providing that any  person  who  shall  commit  any  act  or\n      practice of  sexual  perversity,  either  with  mankind  or  beast  on\n      conviction shall be punished, is not limited  to  instances  involving\n      carnal copulation, but is restricted to cases involving the sex  organ\n      of at least one of the parties. The term &#x27;sexual perversity&#x27; does  not\n      refer to every physical contact by a male with the body of the  female\n      with intent to  cause  sexual  satisfaction  to  the  actor,  but  the\n      condemnation of the statute is limited to unnatural conduct  performed\n      for the purpose of accomplish; abnormal sexual  satisfaction  for  the\n      actor. Under a statute providing that any person participating in  the\n      act or copulating the mouth of one person with  the  sexual  organ  of\n      another is guilty of the offence a person is guilty of  violating  the\n      statute when he has placed his mouth on the genital organ of  another,\n      and the offence may be committed by two persons of opposite sex.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_131\">      11. Though there is no statutory definition of &#x27;sodomy&#x27;,  Section  377\n      is comprehensive to engulf any act like the alleged act. View  similar\n      to mine was expressed in Lohana Vasantlal Devchand  and  Ors.  v.  The\n      State : AIR 1963 Guj 252 and in Khanu&#x27;s case (supra). The  orifice  of\n      the mouth is not, according to nature,  meant  for  sexual  or  carnal\n      intercourse. &#x27;Intercourse&#x27; may be defined as mutual frequent action by\n      members  of  independent  organisation.  Commercial   intercourse   is\n      therefore referred  to;  emphasis  is  made  on  the  reciprocity.  By\n      metaphor the word &#x27;intercourse&#x27; like the word &#x27;commerce&#x27; is applied to\n      the  relations  of  the  sexes.  Here  also  there  is  the  temporary\n      visitation of one organism by a member of the other organisation,  for\n      certain clearly defined and limited objects. The primary object of the\n      visiting organisation is to obtain euphoria by means of  a  detent  of\n      the  nerves  consequent  on  the  sexual  crisis.  But  there  is   no\n      intercourse unless the visiting member is enveloped at least partially\n      by the visited organism, for intercourse connotes reciprocity, and  in\n      this view it would seem  that  sin  of  Gomorrah  is  no  less  carnal\n      intercourse  than  the  sin  of  sodomy.  These  aspects   have   been\n      illuminatingly highlighted in Khanu&#x27;s case (supra).\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_132\">      12. In Stroud&#x27;s Judicial Dictionary, the word &#x27;buggery&#x27; is said to  be\n      synonymous with sodomy. In K.  J.  Ayer&#x27;s  Manual  of  Law  Terms  and\n      Phrases (as Judicially Expounded), the meaning of the word &#x27;sodomy&#x27; is\n      stated to be a carnal knowledge committed against the order of  Nature\n      by a man with a man or in the same unnatural manner with a  woman,  or\n      by a man or woman in any manner with a beast. This is called  buggery.\n      As observed in Lohan Vasantlal Devchand&#x27;s case (supra), sodomy will be\n      a species and unnatural offence will be a generis. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1843411\" id=\"span_65\">In that view of the\n      matter, there can be no scope for any doubt that the act complained of\n      in punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_280\">Sec. 377</a>, IPC.”\n\n\n      Similar views were expressed in State v. Bachmiya Musamiya,  1999  (3)\nGuj LR 2456 and Orissa High Court in Mihir  alias  <a href=\"/doc/1843411/\" id=\"a_281\">Bhikari  Charan  Sahu  v.\nState</a> 1992 Cri LJ 488.  However, from these cases  no uniform  test  can  be\nculled out to classify acts as “carnal  intercourse  against  the  order  of\nnature”. In our opinion the acts which fall within the ambit of the  section\ncan  only  be  determined  with  reference  to  the  act  itself   and   the\ncircumstances in which it is executed. All the  aforementioned  cases  refer\nto non consensual and markedly coercive situations and the keenness  of  the\ncourt in bringing justice to the victims who were either women  or  children\ncannot be discounted while analyzing the manner in  which  the  section  has\nbeen interpreted. We are  apprehensive  of  whether  the  Court  would  rule\nsimilarly in a case of proved consensual intercourse between  adults.  Hence\nit is difficult to prepare a list of acts which  would  be  covered  by  the\nsection. Nonetheless in light of the plain meaning and  legislative  history\nof the section, we hold that <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_282\">Section 377</a> IPC  would  apply  irrespective  of\nage and consent. It is relevant to mention here that  the  <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_283\">Section  377</a>  IPC\ndoes not criminalize a particular people  or  identity  or  orientation.  It\nmerely identifies certain  acts  which  if  committed  would  constitute  an\noffence. Such a prohibition regulates sexual conduct  regardless  of  gender\nidentity and orientation.</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_133\">39.   We shall now  consider  the  question  whether  the  High  Court  was\njustified in entertaining challenge to <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_284\">Section 377</a>  IPC  despite  the  fact\nthat respondent No.1  had  not  laid  factual  foundation  to  support  its\nchallenge.

The writ petition filed by  respondent  No.1  was  singularly  laconic\ninasmuch as except giving brief detail of the work being done by it for  HIV\nprevention targeting MSM community,  it  miserably  failed  to  furnish  the\nparticulars of the incidents of discriminatory  attitude  exhibited  by  the\nState agencies towards sexual minorities and consequential denial  of  basic\nhuman  rights  to  them.  Respondent  No.1  has  also  not   furnished   the\nparticulars of the cases involving harassment and assault  from  public  and\npublic authorities to sexual minorities. Only in the affidavit filed  before\nthis Court  on  behalf  of  the  Ministry  of  Health  and  Family  Welfare,\nDepartment  of  AIDS  Control  it  has  been  averred  that  estimated   HIV\nprevalence among FSW (female sex workers) is 4.60% to 4.94%, among MSM  (men\nwho have sex with men) is 6.54% to 7.23% and IDU (injecting drug  users)  is\n9.42% to 10.30%.

In  paragraph  19,  the  State-wise\ndetails of total  adult  population,  estimated  adult  HIV  prevalence  and\nestimated number of HIV infections as in 2009 has been given.

The question whether a particular classification is  unconstitutional\nwas considered in Re: Special Courts Bill, 1978 (1979) 1 SCC 380.  Speaking\nfor majority of the Constitution Bench, Chandrachud, CJ, referred to  large\nnumber of precedents relating to the scope  of  <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_295\">Article  14</a>  and  concluded\nseveral propositions including the following:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_138\">      “1. The first part of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_296\">Article 14</a>, which was  adopted  from  the  Irish\n      Constitution, is a declaration of equality of the civil rights of  all\n      persons  within  the  territories  of  India.  It  enshrines  a  basic\n      principle of republicanism. The second part, which is a  corollary  of\n      the first and is based on the last clause of the first section of  the\n      Fourteenth Amendment of the American Constitution, enjoins that  equal\n      protection shall be secured to all such persons in  the  enjoyment  of\n      their rights and liberties without discrimination of favourtism. It is\n      a pledge of the protection of equal laws, that is, laws  that  operate\n      alike on all persons under like circumstances.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_139\">      2. The State, in the  exercise  of  its  governmental  power,  has  of\n      necessity to make laws operating differently on  different  groups  or\n      classes of persons within its territory to attain particular  ends  in\n      giving effect to its policies, and it must possess  for  that  purpose\n      large powers of distinguishing and classifying persons or things to be\n      subjected to such laws.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_140\">      3. The Constitutional command to the State to afford equal  protection\n      of  its  laws  sets  a  goal  not  attainable  by  the  invention  and\n      application of a precise formula. Therefore, classification  need  not\n      be constituted by an exact or scientific  exclusion  or  inclusion  of\n      persons or things. The Courts should not insist on delusive  exactness\n      or  apply  doctrinaire  tests  for   determining   the   validity   of\n      classification in any given case. Classification is justified if it is\n      not palpably arbitrary.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_141\">      4. The principle underlying the guarantee of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_297\">Article 14</a>  is  not  that\n      the same rules of law should be applicable to all persons  within  the\n      Indian Territory or that the same remedies should be made available to\n      them irrespective of differences of circumstances. It only means  that\n      all persons similarly circumstanced shall be  treated  alike  both  in\n      privileges conferred and liabilities imposed. Equal laws would have to\n      be applied to all in the  same  situation,  and  there  should  be  no\n      discrimination between one  person  and  another  if  as  regards  the\n      subject-matter of the legislation their position is substantially  the\n      same.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_142\">      5. By the process of  classification,  the  State  has  the  power  of\n      determining who  should  be  regarded  as  a  class  for  purposes  of\n      legislation and in relation to a law enacted on a particular  subject.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_140\">      This power, no doubt,  in  some  degree  is  likely  to  produce  some\n      inequality; but if a law deals with the liberties of a number of well-\n      defined classes, it is not open to  the  charge  of  denial  of  equal\n      protection on the ground that it has no application to other  persons.\n      Classification  thus  means  segregation  in  classes  which  have   a\n      systematic  relation,  usually  found   in   common   properties   and\n      characteristics. It postulates a rational  basis  and  does  not  mean\n      herding together of certain persons and classes arbitrarily.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_141\">      6. The law can make and set apart the classes according to  the  needs\n      and exigencies of the society and as suggested by experience.  It  can\n      recognise even degree of evil, but the classification should never  be\n      arbitrary, artificial or evasive.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_142\">      7. The classification must not be arbitrary but must be rational, that\n      is  to  say,  it  must  not  only  be  based  on  some  qualities   or\n      characteristics which are to be  found  in  all  the  persons  grouped\n      together and not in others who are left out  but  those  qualities  or\n      characteristics must have a reasonable relation to the object  of  the\n      legislation. In order  to  pass  the  test,  two  conditions  must  be\n      fulfilled, namely, (1) that the classification must be founded  on  an\n      intelligible differentia which distinguishes those  that  are  grouped\n      together from others and (2) that differentia  must  have  a  rational\n      relation to the object sought to be achieved by the Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_143\">      8. The differentia which is the basis of the  classification  and  the\n      object of the Act are distinct things and what is  necessary  is  that\n      there must be a nexus between them. In short, while <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_298\">Article 14</a> forbids\n      class discrimination by conferring privileges or imposing  liabilities\n      upon persons arbitrarily selected out  of  a  large  number  of  other\n      persons similarly situated in relation to the privileges sought to  be\n      conferred or the liabilities proposed  to  be  imposed,  it  does  not\n      forbid classification for the purpose of  legislation,  provided  such\n      classification is not arbitrary in the sense above mentioned.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_144\">      9. If the legislative policy is clear and definite and as an effective\n      method of carrying out that policy  a  discretion  is  vested  by  the\n      statute upon a body of administrators or officers  to  make  selective\n      application of the law to certain classes or groups  of  persons,  the\n      statute itself cannot  be  condemned  as  a  piece  of  discriminatory\n      legislation. In such cases, the power  given  to  the  executive  body\n      would  import  a  duty  on  it  to  classify  the  subject-matter   of\n      legislation in accordance with the objective indicated in the statute.\n      If the administrative body proceeds to classify persons or things on a\n      basis  which  has  no  rational  relation  to  the  objective  of  the\n      legislature, its action can be annulled as offending against the equal\n      protection clause. On the other hand, if the statute itself  does  not\n      disclose a definite policy or objective and it  confers  authority  on\n      another to make selection at its pleasure, the statute would  be  held\n      on the face of it to be discriminatory, irrespective  of  the  way  in\n      which it is applied.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_145\">      10. Whether a law conferring discretionary powers on an administrative\n      authority is constitutionally valid or not should not be determined on\n      the assumption that such authority will act in an arbitrary manner  in\n      exercising the discretion committed to it. Abuse of power given by law\n      does occur; but the validity of the law cannot be contested because of\n      such  an  apprehension.  Discretionary  power  is  not  necessarily  a\n      discriminatory power.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_146\">      11. Classification necessarily implies the making of a distinction  or\n      discrimination between  persons  classified  and  those  who  are  not\n      members of that class. It is the essence of a classification that upon\n      the class are cast duties and burdens  different  from  those  resting\n      upon the general public. Indeed, the very idea  of  classification  is\n      that of inequality, so that it goes without saying that the mere  fact\n      of inequality in no manner determines the matter of constitutionality.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_147\">      12. Whether an enactment providing for special procedure for the trial\n      of certain offences is or  is  not  discriminatory  and  violative  of\n      <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_299\">Article 14</a> must be determined in  each  case  as  it  arises,  for  no\n      general rule applicable to all  cases  can  safely  be  laid  down.  A\n      practical assessment of the operation of the  law  in  the  particular\n      circumstances is necessary.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_148\">      13. A rule of procedure <a href=\"/doc/1273177/\" id=\"a_300\">laid down by</a> law  comes  as  much  within  the\n      purview of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_301\">Article 14</a> as  any  rule  of  substantive  law  and  it  is\n      necessary that all litigants, who are similarly situated, are able  to\n      avail themselves of the same procedural  rights  for  relief  and  for\n      defence with like protection and without discrimination.”\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_149\">42.   Those who indulge in carnal intercourse in  the  ordinary  course  and\nthose who  indulge  in  carnal  intercourse  against  the  order  of  nature\nconstitute different classes and the people falling in  the  later  category\ncannot claim that Section 377 suffers from the  vice  of  arbitrariness  and\nirrational classification. What Section 377 does is  merely  to  define  the\nparticular offence and prescribe  punishment  for  the  same  which  can  be\nawarded if in the trial conducted in accordance with the provisions  of  the\n<a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_302\">Code of Criminal Procedure</a> and other statutes of the same family the  person\nis found guilty.

The vagueness and arbitrariness go to the root of a provision and  may\nrender  it  unconstitutional,  making  its  implementation   a   matter   of\nunfettered discretion.

The  underlying\n      principle is that every person is entitled to be informed as  to  what\n      the State commands or forbids and that  the  life  and  liberty  of  a\n      person cannot be put in peril on an ambiguity. However,  even  in  the\n      domain of criminal law, the processes  of  which  can  result  in  the\n      taking away of life itself,  no  more  than  a  reasonable  degree  of\n      certainty has to be accepted as a fact. Neither the criminal  law  nor\n      the Constitution requires the application of impossible standards  and\n      therefore, what is expected is that  the  language  of  the  law  must\n      contain an adequate warning of the conduct which may fall  within  the\n      prescribed area, when measured by common  understanding.  In  criminal\n      law, the legislature frequently uses  vague  expressions  like  &#x27;bring\n      into hatred or contempt&#x27;, &#x27;maintenance of  harmony  between  different\n      religious groups&#x27; or &#x27;likely to cause disharmony  or  hatred  or  ill-\n      will&#x27;, or &#x27;annoyance to the public&#x27;, (see Sections  124A,  153A(1)(b),\n      153B(1)(c), and 268 of the Penal Code). These expressions, though they\n      are difficult to define, do not elude a just application to  practical\n      situations. The use of language carries with it the  inconvenience  of\n      the imperfections of language.”\n\n\n\n\n      In K.A. Abbas v. The Union of India (UOI) and Anr. (1970) 2  SCC  780\nthe Court observed:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_144\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"882909\" id=\"span_70\">“46. These observations which are clearly obiter are  apt  to  be  too\n      generally applied and need to be explained. While it is true that  the\n      principles evolved by the  Supreme  Court  of  the  United  States  of\n      America in the application of the Fourteenth Amendment  were  eschewed\n      in our Constitution and instead the limits  of  restrictions  on  each\n      fundamental right were indicated in the clauses that follow the  first\n      clause of the nineteenth Article, it cannot be  said  as  an  absolute\n      principle that no law will be  considered  bad  for  sheer  vagueness.\n      There is ample authority for the  proposition  that  a  law  affecting\n      fundamental rights may be so considered. A very pertinent  example  is\n      to be found in <a href=\"/doc/882909/\" id=\"a_312\">State of Madhya Pradesh and Anr. v. Baldeo Prasad</a> where\n      the Central Provinces and Berar Goondas Act 1946 was declared void for\n      uncertainty. The condition for the application of <a href=\"/doc/1911574/\" id=\"a_313\">Sections  4</a>  and  4A\n      was that the person sought to be proceeded against must  be  a  goonda\n      but the definition of  goonda  in  the  Act  indicated  no  tests  for\n      deciding which person fell within the definition. The provisions  were\n      therefore held to be uncertain and vague.</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_145\">      47. The real rule is that if a law is vague or appears to be  so,  the\n      court must try to  construe  it,  as  far  as  may  be,  and  language\n      permitting, the construction sought to be placed on  it,  must  be  in\n      accordance with the intention of the legislature. Thus if the  law  is\n      open to diverse construction, that  construction  which  accords  best\n      with the intention of the legislature  and  advances  the  purpose  of\n      legislation, is to be preferred. Where however the law  admits  of  no\n      such construction and the persons applying it are in a  boundless  sea\n      of uncertainty and  the  law  prima  facie  takes  away  a  guaranteed\n      freedom, the law must be held to offend the Constitution as  was  done\n      in the case of the <a href=\"/doc/28632144/\" id=\"a_314\">Goonda Act</a>. This is not application of the doctrine\n      of due process. The invalidity arises  from  the  probability  of  the\n      misuse of the law to the detriment of the individual. If possible, the\n      Court instead of striking down the law may itself  draw  the  line  of\n      demarcation where possible but this effort should  be  sparingly  made\n      and only in the clearest of cases.”\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_152\">45.   We may now deal with the issue of  violation  of  <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_315\">Article  21</a>  of  the\nConstitution.

Arising  from  this  are  the  notions  of\nlegitimate state interest  and  the  principle  of  proportionality.      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1766147\" id=\"span_71\">In\n<a href=\"/doc/1766147/\" id=\"a_320\">Maneka Gandhi v.

Secondly, even  the  fullest  compliance  with  the\n      requirements of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_323\">Article 21</a> is not the journey&#x27;s  end  because,  a  law\n      which prescribes fair  and  reasonable  procedure  for  curtailing  or\n      taking away the personal liberty guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_324\">Article 21</a> has still to\n      meet a possible challenge under other provisions of  the  Constitution\n      like, for example, <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_325\">Articles 14</a> and 19.”\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_148\">46.

There can be no doubt that privacy-dignity claims deserve  to  be\n      examined  with  care  and  to  be  denied  only  when   an   important\n      countervailing interest is shown to be superior.  If  the  Court  does\n      find that a claimed right is entitled to protection as  a  fundamental\n      privacy right, a law infringing it must satisfy the  compelling  state\n      interest test. Then the question would be whether a state interest  is\n      of such paramount importance as would justify an infringement  of  the\n      right. Obviously, if the enforcement of morality were  held  to  be  a\n      compelling  as   well   as   a   permissible   state   interest,   the\n      characterization of ft claimed rights as a fundamental  privacy  right\n      would be of far less significance. The question whether enforcement of\n      morality is a state interest sufficient to justify the infringement of\n      a fundamental privacy right need not be considered for the purpose  of\n      this case and therefore we refuse to enter the  controversial  thicket\n      whether enforcement of morality is a function of state.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_152\">      23. Individual autonomy, perhaps the central concern of any system  of\n      limited government, is protected in part  under  our  Constitution  by\n      explicit  Constitutional  guarantees.  &quot;In  the  application  of   the\n      Constitution our contemplation cannot only be of  what  has  been  but\n      what may be.&quot;  Time  works  changes  and  brings  into  existence  new\n      conditions. Subtler and far reaching means of invadings  privacy  will\n      make it possible to be heard in the street what is  whispered  in  the\n      closet.  Yet,  too  broad  a  definition  of  privacy  raises  serious\n      questions about the propriety of judicial reliance on a right that  is\n      not  explicit  in  the  Constitution.  Of  course,  privacy  primarily\n      concerns the individuals. It therefore relates to  and  overlaps  with\n      the concept of liberty. The most  serious  advocate  of  privacy  must\n      confess that there are serious problems of defining  the  essence  and\n      scope of the right. Privacy interest in autonomy must also  be  placed\n      in the context of other rights and values.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_153\">      24. Any right to privacy  must  encompass  and  protect  the  personal\n      intimacies of the home, the family marriage,  motherhood,  procreation\n      and  child  rearing.  This  catalogue  approach  to  the  question  is\n      obviously not as instructive as it does not give analytical picture of\n      that distinctive characteristics of the right of privacy. Perhaps, the\n      only suggestion that can be offered as unifying  principle  underlying\n      the concept has been the assertion that a  claimed  right  must  be  a\n      fundamental right implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_154\">      25. Rights and freedoms of citizens are set forth in the  Constitution\n      in order to guarantee that the individual, his personality  and  those\n      things stamped with  his  personality  shall  be  free  from  official\n      interference except where a reasonable  basis  for  intrusion  exists.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_155\">      &quot;Liberty against government&quot;  a  phrase  coined  by  Professor  Corwin\n      express this idea forcefully. In this sense, many of  the  fundamental\n      rights of citizens can be described as contributing to  the  right  to\n      privacy.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_156\">      26. As Ely says: &quot;There is nothing to prevent one from using the  word\n      &#x27;privacy&#x27; to mean the freedom to live one&#x27;s life without  governmental\n      interference. But the Court obviously does not so use  the  term.  Nor\n      could it, for such a right is at stake in every case&quot; see  &quot;The  Wages\n      of Crying Wolf: A Comment on Roe v. Wade, 82 Yale L.J. 920.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_157\">      27. There are two possible theories for protecting  privacy  of  home.\n      The first is that activities in the  home  harm  others  only  to  the\n      extent that they cause offence resulting from the  mere  thought  that\n      individuals might he engaging in such activities and that such  &#x27;harm&#x27;\n      is not Constitutionally protective by the state. The  second  is  that\n      individuals need a place of sanctuary where  they  can  be  free  from\n      societal  control.  The  importance  of  such  a  sanctuary  is   that\n      individuals can drop the mask, desist for a while from  projecting  on\n      the world the image they want to be accepted as themselves,  an  image\n      that may reflect the values of their peers rather than  the  realities\n      of their natures see 26 Standford Law Rev. 1161 at 1187.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_158\">      28. The right to privacy in any event  will  necessarily  have  to  go\n      through  a  process  of  case-by-case  development.  Therefore,   even\n      assuming that the right to personal liberty, the right to move  freely\n      throughout the territory of India and the freedom of speech create  an\n      independent right of privacy as an emanation from them which  one  can\n      characterize as a fundamental right, we do not think that the right is\n      absolute.”\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_159\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1500783\" id=\"span_74\">48.

Chandigarh\nAdministration</a> (2009) 9 SCC 1, in  context  of  <a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_338\">Section  3</a>  of  the  Medical\nTermination of Pregnancy Act, 1971, observed:</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_160\">      “11. A plain reading of the above-quoted provision makes it clear that\n      Indian law allows for abortion only if the  specified  conditions  are\n      met. <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_339\">When the MTP Act</a>  was  first  enacted  in  1971  it  was  largely\n      modelled on the Abortion Act of 1967 which  had  been  passed  in  the\n      United Kingdom. The legislative intent  was  to  provide  a  qualified\n      &#x27;right to abortion&#x27; and the termination of pregnancy  has  never  been\n      recognised as a normal recourse for expecting  mothers.  There  is  no\n      doubt that a woman&#x27;s right to make  reproductive  choices  is  also  a\n      dimension of &#x27;personal liberty&#x27; as understood under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_340\">Article 21</a> of  the\n      Constitution of India. It is important to recognise that  reproductive\n      choices can be exercised to procreate  as  well  as  to  abstain  from\n      procreating. The crucial consideration is  that  a  woman&#x27;s  right  to\n      privacy, dignity and bodily integrity should be respected. This  means\n      that there should be no restriction  whatsoever  on  the  exercise  of\n      reproductive choices such as a woman&#x27;s right to  refuse  participation\n      in  sexual  activity  or  alternatively  the  insistence  on  use   of\n      contraceptive methods. Furthermore, women  are  also  free  to  choose\n      birth-control methods such  as  undergoing  sterilisation  procedures.\n      Taken to their  logical  conclusion,  reproductive  rights  include  a\n      woman&#x27;s entitlement to carry a pregnancy to its  full  term,  to  give\n      birth and to subsequently raise children.  However,  in  the  case  of\n      pregnant  women  there  is  also  a  &#x27;compelling  state  interest&#x27;  in\n      protecting  the  life  of  the  prospective  child.   Therefore,   the\n      termination of a pregnancy  is  only  permitted  when  the  conditions\n      specified in the applicable statute have been  fulfilled.  Hence,  the\n      provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_341\">MTP Act, 1971</a>  can  also  be  viewed  as  reasonable\n      restrictions that have been placed on  the  exercise  of  reproductive\n      choices.”\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_161\">      49.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"382721\" id=\"span_75\">In <a href=\"/doc/382721/\" id=\"a_342\">Mr. X v.

In its anxiety to protect the so-called rights of LGBT persons and to\ndeclare that <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_357\">Section 377</a> IPC violates the right to  privacy,  autonomy  and\ndignity, the High Court has extensively relied upon the judgments of  other\njurisdictions.  Though these judgments shed considerable light  on  various\naspects of this right and are informative in  relation  to  the  plight  of\nsexual minorities, we feel that they  cannot  be  applied  blindfolded  for\ndeciding  the  constitutionality  of  the  law  enacted   by   the   Indian\nlegislature.  This view was expressed as early as in 1973 in <a href=\"/doc/1837051/\" id=\"a_358\">Jagmohan Singh\nv. State of U.P.</a> (1973) 1 SCC 20.  In that  case,  a  Constitutional  Bench\nconsidered the legality of the  death  sentence  imposed  by  the  Sessions\nJudge, Shahjahanpur, which was confirmed by the Allahabad High Court.   One\nof the arguments raised by the counsel for the appellant was  that  capital\npunishment has been abolished in U.S. on the ground of violation of the 8th\nAmendment.  While considering that argument, this Court observed:</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_176\">      “13.  Reference was made by Mr Garg to several studies made by Western\n      scholars to show the ineffectiveness of capital punishment either as a\n      detterent or as appropriate retribution.  There  is  large  volume  of\n      evidence compiled in the West by kindly social reformers and  research\n      workers to confound those who want to retain the  capital  punishment.\n      The  controversy  is  not  yet  ended  and  experiments  are  made  by\n      suspending the death sentence where  possible  in  order  to  see  its\n      effect. On the other hand most of these studies suffer from one  grave\n      defect namely that they  consider  all  murders  as  stereotypes,  the\n      result of sudden passion or the like, disregarding motivation in  each\n      individual case. A large number  of  murders  is  undoubtedly  of  the\n      common type. But some at least are diabolical in conception and  cruel\n      in execution. In some others where the victim  is  a  person  of  high\n      standing in the country society is liable to be  rocked  to  its  very\n      foundation. Such murders cannot  be  simply  wished  away  by  finding\n      alibis in the social maladjustment of the murderer. Prevalence of such\n      crimes speaks, in the opinion of many, for the inevitability of  death\n      penalty not only by way of deterrence  but  as  a  token  of  emphatic\n      disapproval by the society.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_177\">      14. We have grave doubts about the expediency of transplanting Western\n      experience in our country. Social conditions are different and so also\n      the general intellectual level. In the context  of  our  Criminal  Law\n      which  punishes  murder,  one  cannot  ignore  the  fact   that   life\n      imprisonment works out in most cases to a dozen years of  imprisonment\n      and it may be seriously questioned whether that sole alternative  will\n      be an adequate substitute for the death  penalty.  We  have  not  been\n      referred to any large-scale studies of crime  statistics  compiled  in\n      this country with the object of estimating the need of  protection  of\n      the society against murders. The only authoritative study is  that  of\n      the Law Commission of India published in 1967. It is its  Thirty-fifth\n      Report. After collecting as much available material  as  possible  and\n      assessing the views expressed in the West both  by  abolitionists  and\n      the retentionists the Law Commission has come  to  its  conclusion  at\n      paras 262 to 264. These paragraphs are summarized by the Commission as\n      follows at p. 354 of the Report:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_178\">         “The issue of abolition or  retention  has  to  be  decided  on  a\n      balancing of the various  arguments  for  and  against  retention.  No\n      single argument for abolition or retention can decide  the  issue.  In\n      arriving at any conclusion on the subject,  the  need  for  protecting\n      society in general and individual human beings must be borne in mind.\n        It is difficult to rule  out  the  validity  of,  or  the  strength\n      behind, many of the arguments for abolition. Nor does  the  Commission\n      treat lightly the argument based on the irrevocability of the sentence\n      of death, the need for a modern  approach,  the  severity  of  capital\n      punishment, and the strong feeling shown by certain sections of public\n      opinion in stressing deeper questions of human values.\n        Having regard, however, to the conditions in India, to the  variety\n      of the social upbringing of its inhabitants, to the disparity  in  the\n      level of morality and education in the country, to the vastness of its\n      area, to the diversity of its population and to the paramount need for\n      maintaining law and order in the  country  at  the  present  juncture,\n      India cannot risk the experiment of abolition of capital punishment.\n        Arguments which would be valid in respect of one area of the  world\n      may not hold good  in  respect  of  another  area,  in  this  context.\n      Similarly, even if abolition in some parts of India  may  not  make  a\n      material difference, it may be fraught with  serious  consequences  in\n      other parts.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_179\">        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"554839\" id=\"span_85\">On a consideration of all the issues involved, the Commission is of\n      the opinion, that capital punishment should be retained in the present\n      state of the country.”\n\n\n\n      The Court also referred to an earlier judgment in <a href=\"/doc/554839/\" id=\"a_359\">State of Madras  v.\nV.G. Row</a> 1952 SCR 597. In that case, Patanjali Sastri, CJ. observed:</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_180\">      “It is important in this context to bear in  mind  that  the  test  of\n      reasonableness,  wherever  prescribed,  should  be  applied  to   each\n      individual statute impugned, and  to  abstract  standard,  or  general\n      pattern, of reasonableness can be  laid  down  as  applicable  to  all\n      cases. The nature of the right alleged to  have  been  infringed,  the\n      underlying purpose of the restrictions imposed, the extent and urgency\n      of the evil sought to be remedied thereby, the  disproportion  of  the\n      imposition, the prevailing conditions at the time,  should  all  enter\n      into the judicial verdict. In  evaluating  such  elusive  factors  and\n      forming their own  conception  of  what  is  reasonable,  in  all  the\n      circumstances of a given  case,  it  is  inevitable  that  the  social\n      philosophy and the scale of values of the judges participating in  the\n      decision should play  an  important  part,  and  the  limit  to  their\n      interference with legislative judgment  in  such  cases  can  only  be\n      dictated by their sense of responsibility and self-restraint  and  the\n      sobering reflection that the Constitution is meant not only for people\n      of their way of thinking but for all, and that  the  majority  of  the\n      elected  representatives  of  the  people  have,  in  authorising  the\n      imposition of the restrictions, considered them to be reasonable”. The\n      responsibility of Judges in that respect is  the  greater,  since  the\n      question as to whether capital sentence for murder is  appropriate  in\n      modern times has raised serious controversy the world over, sometimes,\n      with emotional overtones. It is, therefore, essential that we approach\n      this constitutional question with objectivity and  proper  measure  of\n      self-restraint.”\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_181\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1479755\" id=\"span_86\">53.    The  afore-stated  judgment  was  relied  upon  in  <a href=\"/doc/1479755/\" id=\"a_360\">Surendra  Pal  v.\nSaraswati Arora</a> (1974) 2 SCC 600.  Learned  counsel  who  appeared  for  the\nappellant <a href=\"/doc/1479755/\" id=\"a_361\">in that case</a>  relied  upon  a  passage  from  Halsbury’s  Laws  of\nEngland on the issue of presumption  of  undue  influence  in  the  case  of\nparties engaged to be married.  While refusing to rely upon the  proposition\n<a href=\"/doc/1479755/\" id=\"a_362\">laid down in</a> Halsbury’s laws of England, this Court observed:</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_182\">      “The family law in England has undergone a drastic change,  recognised\n      new social  relationship  between  man  and  woman.  In  our  country,\n      however, even today a marriage is an arranged affair. We  do  not  say\n      that there are no exceptions to this practice  or  that  there  is  no\n      tendency, however imperceptible, for young persons to choose their own\n      spouses, but even in such cases the consent of their parents is one of\n      the desiderata which is sought for. Whether  it  is  obtained  in  any\n      given set  of  circumstances  is  another  matter.  In  such  arranged\n      marriages in this country the question of two  persons  being  engaged\n      for any appreciable time to enable each other to  meet  and  be  in  a\n      position to exercise  undue  influence  on  one  another  very  rarely\n      arises. Even in the case of the  marriage  in  the  instant  case,  an\n      advertisement was resorted to by Bhim Sain. The person who purports to\n      reply is Saraswati’s mother and the person who replied to her was Bhim\n      Sain’s Personal Assistant. But the social considerations prevailing in\n      this country and ethos even in such cases persist in  determining  the\n      respective attitudes. That apart, as we said earlier, the negotiations\n      for  marriage  held  in  Saraswati’s  sister’s  house  have  all   the\n      appearance of a business  transaction.  In  these  circumstances  that\n      portion of the statement of the law in Halsbury which  refers  to  the\n      presumption of the exercise of undue influence in the case of a man to\n      a woman to whom he is engaged to be married would hardly be applicable\n      to conditions in this country. We have had occasion to point  out  the\n      danger of such statements of law enunciated and propounded for meeting\n      the conditions existing in the countries in which they are  applicable\n      from being  blindly  followed  in  this  country  without  a  critical\n      examination  of  those  principles  and  their  applicability  to  the\n      conditions, social norms and attitudes existing in this country. Often\n      statements of  law  applicable  to  foreign  countries  as  stated  in\n      compilations and learned treatises are cited without making a critical\n      examination of those principles in the background  of  the  conditions\n      that existed or exist in those countries. If we are  not  wakeful  and\n      circumspect, there is every likelihood of their being  simply  applied\n      to cases requiring  our  adjudication  without  consideration  of  the\n      background and various other conditions to which we have referred.  On\n      several occasions merely because  courts  in  foreign  countries  have\n      taken  a  different  view  than  that  taken  by  our  courts  or   in\n      adjudicating on any particular matter  we  were  asked  to  reconsider\n      those decisions or to consider them for the first time  and  to  adopt\n      them as the law of this country.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_183\">        No doubt an objective and rational deduction of a principle, if  it\n      emerges from a decision of foreign country, rendered on  pari  materia\n      legislative provisions and which can be applicable to  the  conditions\n      prevailing in this country will assist the  Court  in  arriving  at  a\n      proper conclusion. While we should seek light from whatever source  we\n      can get, we should however guard against being blinded by it.”\n\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_184\">54.
