The defendants no.1 to 6 have also conducted interviews in the news\nmedia towards defaming the plaintiff. The whole foundation of the libelous\nposts/tweets and slanderous statements of the defendants no.1 to 6 is based\non extracts of the statements of two accused persons, being Mr. Sanjeev\nMalik and Mr. Pradeep Kumar Yadav, former employees of KVIC, recorded\npursuant to the FIR dated 10th July, 2017 bearing no.

At this prima facie stage, the Court has to adjudicate whether there is\nan element of truth in the impugned content and/or whether it qualifies for\nthe defence of fair comment.

The statements made by the defendants no.1 to 6, that the plaintiff\nwas involved in any acts of corruption at the time of demonetization, are\ncompletely unsubstantiated. There is nothing to suggest that the statements\nextracted at pages 52 and 53 of the plaint and relied upon in the tweet of 29th\nAugust, 2022 are made by the accused persons before the Investigating\nAgency. Even if the aforesaid statements are taken to be correct, the said\nstatements are completely based on hearsay, being premised solely on the\naccused persons being told by other individuals that the said acts were to be\ndone at the behest of the Chairman. Further, the subject matter of the\naforesaid statement is a sum of Rs.17,00,000/-, which has been exaggerated\nby the defendants many times over, to a fanciful sum of Rs.\n1,400,00,00,000/- (rupees one thousand four hundred crores).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_27\">II.

The defendants no.1 to 6 have also made allegations in respect of a\ncontract of Rs.80,00,00,000/- (rupees eighty crores) being assigned to the\ndaughter of the plaintiff while the plaintiff was the Chairman of KVIC. Once\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                                                           Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                                                           Digitally Signed By:AMIT</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">                                                           BANSAL</span>\n\nCS(OS) 593/2022                                                              Page12:26:21\n                                                           Signing Date:27.09.2022 7 of 13\n again, the defendants have made unfounded allegations that an imaginary\nsum of Rs.80,00,00,000/- (rupees eighty crores) has been paid to the\ndaughter of the plaintiff. There is no material on record to substantiate the\naforesaid statement. Further, KVIC in its letter dated 2nd September, 2022\nhas clarified that no money was paid to the daughter of the plaintiff for the\nprofessional services rendered by her.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_29\">III.    CASH PAYMENTS MADE TO WEAVERS IN BIHAR\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_30\">24.     Counsels for the defendants have placed reliance on the order dated\n30th August, 2016 passed in Civil Writ Jurisdiction Case No.2918 of 2016\nby the Patna High Court in support of the statements made by the defendants\nthat cash was distributed to the weavers in Bhagalpur, Bihar while the\nplaintiff was the Chairman of KVIC. I have perused the order of the Patna\nHigh Court. There is nothing in the said order that indicts the plaintiff in any\nmanner. Even if some irregularities occurred while the plaintiff was the\nChairman of KVIC, the plaintiff cannot be made personally liable for the\nsame. This cannot be the basis of a personal attack against the plaintiff.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_31\">25.     On behalf of the defendants, it has also been vehemently contended\nthat in cases of defamation, so long as some material has been placed on\nrecord, the veracity of the allegations can only be tested in trial and the\nadequate remedy would be damages, not interim injunction. I do not agree\nwith the said submission. In appropriate cases where the Court is of the view\nthat statements are unsubstantiated and have been made in a reckless manner\nwithout regard to the truth, in order to cause injury to the reputation of the\nplaintiff, the Court would be justified in granting an interim injunction. If\nthe aforesaid submission of the defendants is accepted, it would give the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">                                                           Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">                                                           Digitally Signed By:AMIT</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                                                           BANSAL</span>\n\nCS(OS) 593/2022                                                              Page12:26:21\n                                                           Signing Date:27.09.2022 8 of 13\n defendant a free reign to continue making defamatory statements against the\nplaintiff and continue to tarnish his reputation. Therefore, the Court cannot\nbe powerless in such a situation. After suffering the brunt of such\ndefamatory content, it is difficult to contemplate a complete restitution\nthrough damages. Such cases demand immediate injunctive relief and the\nCourt cannot wait for the defendants to place their response on record.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_32\">26.     In the present case, the plaintiff, being a Constitutional Authority,\ncannot meet the personal attacks being made by the defendants against him\nby taking resort to social media platforms. The defendants have not even\nbothered to respond to the legal notice dated 5th September, 2022 sent on\nbehalf of the plaintiff. Therefore, the only remedy available for the plaintiff\nto protect his reputation and prevent erosion of the same would be to\napproach the court of law and seek injunctive relief.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_33\">27.     It has been submitted on behalf of the defendants that the plaintiff\nbeing a person in public life cannot claim right to privacy in the same\nmanner as that as an ordinary individual. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"572071\" id=\"span_25\">In R.

Relevant part of the judgment is set out\nbelow:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">        &quot;26. We may now summarise the broad principles flowing from\n        the above discussion:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">        (1) The right to privacy is implicit in the right to life and liberty\n        guaranteed to the citizens of this country by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_10\">Article 21.</a> It is a\n        &quot;right to be let alone&quot;.

None can publish anything concerning the above\n        matters without his consent -- whether truthful or otherwise and\n        whether laudatory or critical. If he does so, he would be\n        violating the right to privacy of the person concerned and would\n        be liable in an action for damages. Position may, however, be\n        different, if a person voluntarily thrusts himself into controversy\n        or voluntarily invites or raises a controversy.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">        (2) The rule aforesaid is subject to the exception, that any\n        publication concerning the aforesaid aspects becomes\n        unobjectionable if such publication is based upon public records\n        including court records. This is for the reason that once a matter\n        becomes a matter of public record, the right to privacy no longer\n        subsists and it becomes a legitimate subject for comment by\n        press and media among others. We are, however, of the opinion\n        that in the interests of decency [<a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_11\">Article 19(2)]</a> an exception must\n        be carved out to this rule, viz., a female who is the victim of a\n        sexual assault, kidnap, abduction or a like offence should not\n        further be subjected to the indignity of her name and the incident\n        being publicised in press/media.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">        (3) There is yet another exception to the rule in (1) above --\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_34\">        indeed, this is not an exception but an independent rule. In the\n        case of public officials, it is obvious, right to privacy, or for that\n        matter, the remedy of action for damages is simply not\n        available with respect to their acts and conduct relevant to the\n        discharge of their official duties. This is so even where the\n        publication is based upon facts and statements which are not\n        true, unless the official establishes that the publication was\n        made (by the defendant) with reckless disregard for truth. In\n        such a case, it would be enough for the defendant (member of the\n        press or media) to prove that he acted after a reasonable\n        verification of the facts; it is not necessary for him to prove that\n        what he has written is true. Of course, where the publication is\n        proved to be false and actuated by malice or personal animosity,\n        the defendant would have no defence and would be liable for\n        damages. It is equally obvious that in matters not relevant to\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">                                                              Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">                                                              Digitally Signed By:AMIT</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">                                                              BANSAL</span>\n\nCS(OS) 593/2022                                                                 Page12:26:21\n                                                              Signing Date:27.09.2022 10 of 13\n         the discharge of his duties, the public official enjoys the same\n        protection as any other citizen, as explained in (1) and (2)\n        above. It needs no reiteration that judiciary, which is protected\n        by the power to punish for contempt of court and Parliament and\n        legislatures protected as their privileges are by <a href=\"/doc/1251904/\" id=\"a_12\">Articles 105</a> and\n        <a href=\"/doc/1085458/\" id=\"a_13\">104</a> respectively of the Constitution of India, represent\n        exceptions to this rule.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_35\">28.     In Kailash Gehlot (supra) relied upon by the defendants, one of the\nfactors that weighed with the Court in not granting interim injunction was\nthat the defamatory comments were in respect of discharge of public\nfunctions by the plaintiff in his capacity as a minister. Admittedly, the\nallegations made in the present case do not pertain to the plaintiff\ndischarging his official duties as Lieutenant Governor of Delhi.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_36\">29.     Further, the reliance placed by the defendants on the judgments\nof Tata Sons (supra) and Prakash Jha Productions (supra) is misplaced, as\nthe said judgments are in the context of defamation of a corporate entity,\nwhereas the present case relates to defamation in respect of an individual.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_37\">30.     On a prima facie view, the various statements/interviews/press\nconferences/tweets/re-tweets/hashtags made by the defendants are per se\ndefamatory. The same have been made in a reckless manner, without any\nfactual verification, in order to tarnish the reputation of the plaintiff. It\ncannot be gainsaid that reputation of a person is earned after years and the\nsame cannot be tarnished by any other individual in a casual manner. The\ndamage caused to the reputation of an individual is immediate and far-\nreaching on the internet. So long as the impugned content continues to be in\ncirculation and visible on social media, it is likely to cause continuing\ndamage to the reputation and image of the plaintiff.
