Sri B.Adinarayana Rao, Senior Counsel appearing\n\nfor the appellants sought to contend that the sad events\n\nin the life of the respondent are admittedly in public\n\ndomain even according to the respondent ( as can be\n\nseen from the averments made in paras 3 and 4 of the\n\nplaint wherein reference is made to the Sessions Case\n\nNo.70 of 2019 filed in regard to the alleged murder of the\n\nhusband of the respondent            and also the death of the\n                          ::13::                  MSR,J &amp; TA,J\n                                                 cma_351_2020\n\n\n\n\nrespondent&#x27;s father, subsequently on 08.03.2020) ; that\n\nthe movie being made by the appellants is a fictional\n\nmovie based on the information available in the public\n\ndomain with regard to the events, such as those which\n\noccurred in the life of the respondent; that in the month\n\nof August, 2020 there was another such honour killing\n\nwhich took place in the State of Telangana; and that\n\nthere is no right of privacy to be protected in the event\n\nthe information comes from public records.        He also\n\noffered that his client would ensure that the name of the\n\nrespondent, her deceased father and her deceased\n\nhusband will not figure anywhere in the proposed movie\n\nbeing made by the appellants, so as not to cause any\n\nembarrassment to the respondent.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_61\">\nContentions of Counsel for the respondent :\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_62\">37. Sri   V.Raghunath,    counsel   for   the   respondent\n\nsupported the reasoning of the Trial court.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_63\">38.   He contended that Ex.s P1 to P6 filed by the\n\nrespondent clearly indicate that the appellants had made\n\na movie about the life story events of the respondent and\n\nhad also referred to the respondent, her father Maruthi\n\nRao and her deceased husband, Pranay, specifically in\n\nExs.P1 to P3 and Ex.P5 poster of the movie &#x27;Murder&#x27;,\n                               ::14::                   MSR,J &amp; TA,J\n                                                       cma_351_2020\n\n\n\n\nthereby violating the right of privacy of the respondent,\n\nwhich is guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_7\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of\n\nIndia.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_64\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_65\">39.      He placed strong reliance on the judgment of\n\nR.Raja Gopal &#x27;s case (1 supra) and stated that the order\n\npassed     by   the   Trial   court    did   not   warrant    any\n\ninterference by this Court in exercise of its appellate\n\njurisdiction.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_66\">\nConsideration by this Court;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_67\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_68\">40. From the facts narrated above, it is clear that the\n\nrespondent/plaintiff is asserting her right of privacy in\n\nrelation to her life story events such as her marriage with\n\nLate Sri Pranay Kumar, murder of the said Pranay\n\nKumar allegedly by her father Maruthi Rao and others,\n\nthe subsequent death of the said Maruthi Rao, and the\n\ntragedy visited on her life by these events.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_69\">41. According to her, the right to privacy guaranteed to\n\nher by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_8\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India is sought to\n\nbe violated by the appellants by specifically referring to\n\nher name, her husband&#x27;s name and her father&#x27;s name in\n\nvarious social media posts, such as twitter, Instagram,\n\nwhatsapp messages, posted by 1st appellant.\n</p><pre id=\"pre_7\">                          ::15::                 MSR,J &amp; TA,J\n                                                cma_351_2020\n\n\n\n\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_70\">42. In paragraphs 3 and 4 of the plaint, she herself\n\nreferred to the filing of an FIR in regard to the death of\n\nher husband allegedly caused by her father and others\n\nand a Sessions Case No.70 of 2019 pending before the\n\nSpecial Judge for Trial of SCs/STs (POA) Act cases,\n\nNalgonda in relation to the same.    She also referred to\n\nthe death of her father, which occurred on 08.03.2020 in\n\nregard to which a Crime No.112 of 2020 which was\n\nregistered under <a href=\"/doc/411677/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 174</a> of Cr.P.C. and which is said\n\nto be under investigation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_71\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_72\">43. Thus, the events which have occurred in her life i.e.,\n\nalleged murder of her husband and the later death of her\n\nfather are admitted by her to be in public domain.     The\n\ncounsel for the respondent did not deny that there was\n\nalso wide range reporting in the local newspapers and\n\ncable TV channels about these events.         Thus, this\n\ninformation was in public domain.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_73\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_74\">44. It is also not disputed that in August, 2020, there\n\nwas another alleged case of honor killing similar to the\n\nalleged events which took place in the life of the\n\nrespondent.\n</p><pre id=\"pre_8\">                                    ::16::                              MSR,J &amp; TA,J\n                                                                       cma_351_2020\n\n\n\n\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_75\">45. In our view, it cannot therefore be said that the\n\nevents which have occurred in the life of the respondent\n\nare in that sense unique to her and to her family alone.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_76\">46. In R.Raja Gopal&#x27;s case (1 supra) the Supreme Court\n\nsummarized the principles relating to the protection of\n\nright to privacy in the following manner:\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">     &quot;26. We may now summarise the broad principles\n     flowing from the above discussion:\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">     (1) The right to privacy is implicit in the right to life\n        and liberty guaranteed to the citizens of this\n        country by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_10\">Article 21.</a> It is a &quot;right to be let\n        alone&quot;. A citizen has a right to safeguard the\n        privacy     of    his    own, his     family,   marriage,\n        procreation,       motherhood,       child-bearing       and\n        education among other matters. None can\n        publish anything concerning the above matters\n        without     his        consent    whether     truthful    or\n        otherwise and whether laudatory or critical. If\n        he does so, he would be violating the right to\n        privacy of the person concerned and would be\n        liable in an action for damages. Position may,\n        however, be different, if a person voluntarily\n        thrusts himself into controversy or voluntarily\n        invites or raises a controversy.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">     (2) The rule aforesaid is subject to the exception,\n        that any publication concerning the aforesaid\n        aspects     becomes         unobjectionable       if    such\n        publication       is    based     upon   public    records\n        including court records. This is for the reason\n        that once a matter becomes a matter of public\n        record, the right to privacy no longer subsists\n        and    it   becomes        a     legitimate   subject    for\n                            ::17::                           MSR,J &amp; TA,J\n                                                            cma_351_2020\n\n\n\n\n   comment by press and media among others.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_77\">   We are, however, of the opinion that in the\n   interests of decency [<a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_11\">Article 19.2]</a> an exception\n   must be carved out to this rule, viz., a female\n   who is the victim of a sexual assault, kidnap,\n   abduction or a like offence should not further\n   be subjected to the indignity of her name and\n   the incident being publicised in press/media.\n\n(3) There is yet another exception to the rule in (1)\n   above\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_78\">  - indeed, this is not an exception but an\n   independent rule. In the case of public officials,\n   it is obvious, right to privacy, or for that matter,\n   the remedy of action for damages is simply not\n   available with respect to their acts and conduct\n   relevant to the discharge of their official duties.\n   This is so even where the publication is based\n   upon facts and statements which are not true,\n   unless   the    official     establishes    that   the\n   publication was made (by the defendant) with\n   reckless disregard for truth. In such a case, it\n   would be enough for the defendant (member of\n   the press or media) to prove that he acted after\n   a reasonable verification of the facts; it is not\n   necessary for him to prove that what he has\n   written is true. Of course, where the publication\n   is proved to be false and actuated by malice or\n   personal animosity, the defendant would have\n   no defence and would be liable for damages. It\n   is equally obvious that in matters not relevant\n   to the discharge of his duties, the public official\n   enjoys the same protection as any other citizen,\n   as explained in (1) and (2) above. It needs no\n   reiteration that judiciary, which is protected by\n   the power to punish for contempt of court and\n   Parliament and legislatures protected as their\n   privileges   are   by      <a href=\"/doc/1251904/\" id=\"a_12\">Articles   105</a>   and    <a href=\"/doc/1085458/\" id=\"a_13\">104\n                                    :</a>:18::                            MSR,J &amp; TA,J\n                                                                     cma_351_2020\n\n\n\n\n            respectively   of    the    Constitution   of   India,\n            represent exceptions to this rule.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_79\">         (4) So far as the Government, local authority and\n            other    organs      and    institutions   exercising\n            governmental        power    are   concerned,    they\n            cannot maintain        a    suit for   damages for\n            defaming them.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_80\">         (5) Rules 3 and 4 do not, however, mean that\n            <a href=\"/doc/61492784/\" id=\"a_14\">Official Secrets Act, 1923</a>, or any similar\n            enactment or provision having the force of law\n            does not bind the press or media.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_81\">         (6) There is no law empowering the State or its\n            officials to prohibit, or to impose a prior\n            restraint upon the press/media.&quot; (emphasis\n            supplied)\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_82\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"91938676\" id=\"span_3\">47.      The judgment in R.Raja Gopal&#x27;s case(1 supra) has\n\nalso been upheld in <a href=\"/doc/91938676/\" id=\"a_15\">K.S.Puttaswamy(Retd) and Anr. vs\n\nUnion Of India and Anr.2</a> at paras 63, 64 and 103.</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_83\">48. No doubt a person undoubtedly has a right to\n\nprivacy in relation to her family, marriage, procreation,\n\nmotherhood and child-bearing and none can publish\n\nanything concerned with these matters without his/her\n\nconsent.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_84\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_85\">49. Yet, there is an exception to the said rule i.e., that\n\nany publication concerning these aspects would become\n\nunobjectionable if such publication is based upon public\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">2</span>\n    2017(10) SCC 1\n                           ::19::                  MSR,J &amp; TA,J\n                                                  cma_351_2020\n\n\n\n\nrecords including court records.     In other words, once\n\nthe matter becomes a matter of public record, the right to\n\nprivacy is no longer subsisting and it becomes a\n\nlegitimate subject for comment for press and media\n\namong others. There are of course some exceptions to\n\nthis exception, with which were not concerned.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_86\">50. When the events which occurred in the life of the\n\nrespondent are already in public domain, she cannot\n\nplead any violation of right of privacy by the appellants in\n\nmaking a movie based on such events. The Trial court\n\ndid not consider this aspect of the matter i.e information\n\nalready being in public domain while passing the\n\nimpugned order. So it&#x27;s order cannot be sustained.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_87\">51. It cannot be denied that if any movie is made by\n\nspecifically referring to her name, her husband&#x27;s name\n\nand her father&#x27;s name, much pain and anguish would be\n\ncaused to the respondent, but, since the appellants have\n\nassured through their Senior Counsel that they would\n\nnot use the name of the respondent, her deceased\n\nhusband or her deceased father in the movie &#x27;Murder&#x27;\n\nbeing made by them, we accept the said undertaking.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_88\">52. Accordingly, this Civil Miscellaneous Appeal is\n\nallowed and the order dt.24.08.2020 in IA.No.93 of 2020\n                            ::20::                  MSR,J &amp; TA,J\n                                                   cma_351_2020\n\n\n\n\nin OS.No.23 of 2020 on the file of the Special Sessions\n\nJudge for SC/STs (POA) Act Cases-cum-VII Additional\n\nDistrict Judge, Nalgonda, is set aside subject to the\n\ncondition of the appellants not using or referring to the\n\nrespondent or her deceased husband or her deceased\n\nfather by name or the captions mentioned in twitter,\n\nsocial media, anywhere in the movie &#x27;Murder&#x27; being made\n\nby them and also in the social media, printing material\n\n(posters).
