In\n particular, he submitted that most of the information applied\n for by Mr Agarwal was obtained by the SEBI in its fiduciary\n capacity, and there was no larger public interest warranting\n the disclosure of this information. He submitted that\n disclosure of the information applied for would also\n prejudicially affect the State&#x27;s economic interest. Mr Bhatt\n further submitted that the information sought relates to\n personal information, the disclosure of which has no\n relationship to any public activity or interest. He submitted\n that the furnishing of such information would cause an\n unwarranted invasion of individual privacy, and there was no\n larger public interest justifying its disclosure.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\"> 10.     Mr Bhatt submitted that much of the information\n applied for by Mr Agarwal pertains to third parties like BSE,\n NSE and other stock exchanges. The CIC, in making the\n impugned order, had completely ignored the provisions of\n <a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 11</a> of the RTI, and for this reason, the impugned order\n is also vulnerable.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_11\"> 11.

He submitted that while an RTI applicant may not\n be required to disclose their motives for seeking the\n information, it was still highly challenging for SEBI to deal\n with such applications bereft of any particulars.

They pointed out that\n information regarding the functioning of share markets is\n extremely sensitive economic information.

The learned Counsel for the stock exchanges submitted\n that no information relating to stock exchanges, including the\n information that may have been supplied by the stock\n exchanges to the SEBI in its fiduciary capacity, can be\n disclosed. They further pointed out that the provisions of\n <a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 11</a> of the RTI were never followed, even though the\n information mainly relates to the stock exchanges, which are\n third parties in relation to Mr Agarwal and SEBI.

Mr Venugopal, the learned Counsel for Mr Agarwal,\n clinically analysed the SEBI&#x27;s response to the RTI application,\n the orders made by the first and second appellate authorities\n and the impugned order made by the CIC. He submitted that\n SEBI and others are now attempting to raise grounds other\n than those on which their initial arbitrary rejection was based.\n He submitted that this was clearly impermissible, and the\n parties should not be allowed to add new grounds to sustain\n the otherwise arbitrary rejection of the information sought by\n Mr Agarwal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_18\"> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"86904342\" id=\"span_26\">18.     Mr Venugopal submitted that no information sought for\n by Mr Agarwal was received by SEBI in its fiduciary capacity.\n In any event, there was a larger public interest in\n transparency in the functioning of the SEBI and the stock\n exchanges involved. He submitted that the principles set out\n in <a href=\"/doc/86904342/\" id=\"a_25\">Jayantilal N Mistry</a> (supra) clearly apply, and based upon\n the same, the information could not have been denied to Mr\n Agarwal.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_19\"> 19.     Mr Venugopal submitted that there was no issue of\n competitive secrets or personal information involved in this\n matter. He submitted that SEBI, as a regulator, appoints public\n interest directors to the boards of various stock exchanges.\n Such appointments are in the public interest and for the\n proper regulation of the stock exchanges. He submitted that\n there can be no secrecy regards policy, guidelines, mode of\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">                               Page 13 of 35</span>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">::: Uploaded on - 10/07/2025                     ::: Downloaded on - 10/07/2025 22:21:41 :::</span>\n                                                 WP-10909-2023+-J-F.DOCX\n\n\n\n selection and parameters of selection of such public interest\n directors. Therefore, the denial of information under queries 2\n and 3 was contrary to the provisions of RTI.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_20\"> 20.     Mr Venugopal submitted that SEBI annually inspects the\n stock exchanges. However, there is no transparency regarding\n such reports, and therefore, the public has no means of\n knowing the deficiencies or concerns, if any, reflected in the\n annual inspection reports. The public is also deprived of\n knowledge about the action taken, if any, based on the issues\n flagged in such reports. He submitted that such reports should\n be published on the SEBI&#x27;s website, and there was no good\n ground to resist supplying such information.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\"> 21.     Therefore, Mr Venugopal submitted that the denial of\n information in response to queries 4 and 5 was contrary to the\n provisions of the RTI.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\"> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"86904342\" id=\"span_29\">22.     Mr Venugopal stressed on <a href=\"/doc/86904342/\" id=\"a_26\">Jayantilal N Mistry</a> (supra)\n and pointed out that <a href=\"/doc/86904342/\" id=\"a_27\">the said decision</a> still holds the field and\n has not been set aside or reviewed. He submitted that the RBI,\n which is also the regulator of banks, has resisted providing\n identical information. Still, the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court held\n that such resistance was not valid given the provisions of the\n RTI.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"86904342\" id=\"span_30\">He submitted that no qualitative difference in the\n information applied for by Mr Agarwal under queries 4 and 5,\n and therefore, consistent with the decision of the Hon&#x27;ble\n Supreme Court in              <a href=\"/doc/86904342/\" id=\"a_28\">Jayantilal N Mistry</a> (supra), such\n information had to be supplied to Mr Agarwal.</span>\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">                                Page 14 of 35</span>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">::: Uploaded on - 10/07/2025                      ::: Downloaded on - 10/07/2025 22:21:41 :::</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_23\">                                                      WP-10909-2023+-J-F.DOCX\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\"> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"41281944\" id=\"span_33\">23.

Based        on       all   these   submissions,       Mr      Venugopal\n contended that the Petitions instituted by SEBI be dismissed\n and the Petitions instituted by Mr Agarwal be allowed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_26\"> 25.

The Constitution Bench, after quoting the provisions of\n <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_64\">Section 8</a> of the RTI Act explained that the non-obstante\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">                               Page 20 of 35</span>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">::: Uploaded on - 10/07/2025                     ::: Downloaded on - 10/07/2025 22:21:41 :::</span>\n                                                WP-10909-2023+-J-F.DOCX\n\n\n\n phrase with which <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_65\">Section 8(1)</a> begins carves out an\n exception to the general obligation to disclose information\n under the RTI. Therefore, where the conditions set out in any\n of the sub-clauses to Clause (1) of <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_66\">Section 8</a> are satisfied,\n Information Officers are under no obligation to provide\n information to any applicant. The Constitution Bench has also\n explained that clauses (a), (b), (c), (f), (g) and (h) to note\n sub-section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_67\">Section 8</a> provide an absolute exemption\n from the obligation of disclosure under the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_68\">RTI Act</a>. However,\n clauses (d), (e), (i) and (j) to sub-section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_69\">Section 8</a>\n provide a qualified exemption from disclosure. For example,\n clause (a) to sub-section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_70\">Section 8</a> provides an\n unconditional exemption where it is determined that\n disclosure of the information sought &quot;would prejudicially\n affect the sovereignty and integrity of India&quot;. On the other\n hand, while clause (d) to <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_71\">Section 8(1)</a> similarly provides that\n information is exempt from disclosure where such disclosure\n &quot;would harm the competitive position of a third party&quot; the\n exemption is further qualified by the phrase, &quot;unless the\n competent authority is satisfied that larger public interest\n warrants the disclosure&quot;. Thus, the exemption under clause\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_37\"> (d) is not absolute but is qualified and cannot be invoked\n where a &quot;larger public interest&quot; exists. Where the Information\n Officer determines that the &quot;larger public interest&quot; warrants a\n disclosure, the exemption in clause (d) cannot be invoked,\n and the information must be disclosed.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">                               Page 21 of 35</span>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">::: Uploaded on - 10/07/2025                     ::: Downloaded on - 10/07/2025 22:21:41 :::</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_38\">                                                       WP-10909-2023+-J-F.DOCX\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_39\"> 36.     Similarly, the Constitution Bench, in the context of\n Clause (j) of <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_72\">Section 8(1)</a> explained that it provides a\n qualified exemption from disclosure where the information\n sought relates to &quot;personal information the disclosure of\n which has no relationship to any public activity or interest&quot; or\n the     disclosure            of   the    information      would         cause       an\n &quot;unwarranted            invasion         of   the   privacy&quot;.     However,          the\n exemption may be overridden where the Information Officer\n is &quot;satisfied that the larger public interest justifies the\n disclosure&quot;. Clause (j) is not an absolute exemption from the\n disclosure of information on the ground of privacy, but states\n that disclosure is exempted in cases where &quot;personal\n information&quot; is sought and there exists no &quot;larger public\n interest&quot;. Where the Information Officer is satisfied that the\n existence of the &quot;larger public interest&quot; justifies the disclosure\n of the &quot;personal information&quot;, the information must be\n disclosed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_40\"> 37.       <a href=\"/doc/436180/\" id=\"a_73\">Section 2(n)</a> of the RTI Act defines &quot;third party&quot; to\n mean a person other than the citizen requesting information,\n and includes a public authority. <a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_74\">Section 11</a> is concerned with\n third-party information. The Constitution Bench explained\n that &quot;Third party information&quot; is information which &quot;relates to\n or has been supplied by any other person (including a public\n authority) other than the information applicant and has been\n treated as confidential by such third party&quot;.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">                                     Page 22 of 35</span>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_50\">::: Uploaded on - 10/07/2025                             ::: Downloaded on - 10/07/2025 22:21:41 :::</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_41\">                                                WP-10909-2023+-J-F.DOCX\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_42\"> 38.     Where disclosure of &quot;third party information&quot; is sought,\n and such information has been prima facie treated as\n confidential by the third party in question, the procedure\n under <a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_75\">Section 11</a> of the RTI Act is mandatory. The Information\n Officer shall, within five days of receiving the request for\n &quot;third party information&quot; notify the relevant third party to\n whom the information relates or which had supplied it. The\n notice shall invite the third party to submit reasons (in writing\n or orally) as to whether or not the information sought should\n be disclosed. <a href=\"/doc/1567161/\" id=\"a_76\">Section 11(2)</a> provides the third party with a\n right to make a representation against the proposed disclosure\n within ten days of receiving the notice.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_43\"> 39.     The provision expressly mandates the Information\n Officer to consider the objections of the third party when\n deciding whether to disclose or not disclose the information.\n It encapsulates the fundamental idea that a party whose\n personal information is sought to be disclosed is afforded the\n opportunity to contest disclosure. The proviso to sub-section\n (1) of <a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_77\">Section 11</a> permits disclosure where the &quot;public\n interest&quot; in disclosure outweighs any possible harm in\n disclosure highlighted by the third party.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_44\"> 40.     The Constitution Bench explained that <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_78\">Sections 8</a> and\n <a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_79\">11</a> must be read in conjunction with each other. Other than in\n a case where the information applicant seeks the disclosure of\n information which relates to the information applicant herself,\n information sought that falls under the category of &quot;personal\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_51\">                               Page 23 of 35</span>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\">::: Uploaded on - 10/07/2025                     ::: Downloaded on - 10/07/2025 22:21:41 :::</span>\n                                                WP-10909-2023+-J-F.DOCX\n\n\n\n information&quot; within the meaning of clause (j) of <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_80\">Section 8(1)</a>\n is also &quot;third party information&quot; within the ambit of Section\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_45\"> 11. Therefore, in every case where the requested information\n is &quot;personal information&quot; within the meaning of clause (j) of\n subsection (1) of <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_81\">Section 8</a>, the procedure for notice and\n objections under <a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_82\">Section 11</a> must be complied with. The two\n provisions create a substantive system of checks and balances\n that seek to balance the right of the information applicant to\n receive information with the right of the third party to prevent\n the disclosure of personal information, permitting the latter to\n contest the proposed disclosure.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_46\"> 41.     The contention that <a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_83\">Section 11</a> applied only to\n situations where information sought was directly supplied by\n a third party, and not to situations where the information\n related to the third party but was not supplied by it, was\n rejected by the Constitution Bench. The Court held that the\n procedure under <a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_84\">Section 11</a> must be complied with not only\n in cases where information has been supplied to the public\n authority by a third party, but also when the information held\n by the public authority &quot;relates to&quot; a third party.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_47\"> 42.     <a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_85\">Section 11</a> is not merely a procedural provision, but a\n substantive protection to third parties against the disclosure of\n their personal information held by public authorities, without\n their knowledge or consent. The mere fact that the public\n authority holds information relating to a third party does not\n render it freely disclosable under the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_86\">RTI Act</a>. A third party\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_53\">                               Page 24 of 35</span>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_54\">::: Uploaded on - 10/07/2025                     ::: Downloaded on - 10/07/2025 22:21:41 :::</span>\n                                                WP-10909-2023+-J-F.DOCX\n\n\n\n may have good reason to object to the disclosure of the\n information, including on the ground that the disclosure\n would constitute a breach of the right to privacy. By including\n the requirement of inviting objections and providing a hearing\n on the proposed disclosure of third-party information to the\n very party that the disclosure may adversely impact, <a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_87\">Section\n 11</a> embodies the principles of natural justice.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_48\"> 43.       The Constitution Bench was concerned inter alia with\n information regarding the declaration of assets by members of\n the judiciary and the official file noting&#x27;s and correspondence\n concerning the elevation of judges to the Supreme Court. The\n Court held that the information sought regarding the assets of\n Judges is not generated by the Supreme Court itself, but is\n provided by individual Judges to the Supreme Court. The file\n notes regarding the elevation of Judges do not merely contain\n information about the operation of the Supreme Court, but\n also relate to individual Judges being considered for elevation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_49\"> 44.     Thus, the Court held that the information sought both\n &quot;relates to&quot; and &quot;has been supplied by&quot; a third party and &quot;has\n been treated confidentially by that third party&quot;.                          The\n procedure under <a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_88\">Section 11</a> was held to be applicable\n regarding the information sought by Mr Agarwal in the said\n matter and had to be mandatorily complied with.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_50\"> 45.     The Constitution Bench also explained the interplay\n between the right to privacy, which is now accepted as one of\n the facets of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_89\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution, and the Right to\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\">                               Page 25 of 35</span>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_56\">::: Uploaded on - 10/07/2025                     ::: Downloaded on - 10/07/2025 22:21:41 :::</span>\n                                                WP-10909-2023+-J-F.DOCX\n\n\n\n Information Act. The Court explained that the RTI is a\n legislative enactment that contains a finely tuned balancing of\n interests between the privacy rights of individuals whose\n information may be disclosed and the broader public interest\n in ensuring transparency, accountability, and an informed\n electorate. The overarching scheme of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_90\">RTI Act</a>, and in\n particular <a href=\"/doc/1979161/\" id=\"a_91\">Sections 3</a>, <a href=\"/doc/13503/\" id=\"a_92\">4</a>, and <a href=\"/doc/1831074/\" id=\"a_93\">7</a>, constitutes a mandate to fulfil\n the positive content of the &quot;right to information&quot; as a facet of\n <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_94\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_51\"> 46.     The privacy interest protected by clause (j) of subsection\n (1) of <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_95\">Section 8</a> engages the principle of informational privacy\n as a facet of constitutional privacy, as recognised by this Court\n in K.S. Puttaswamy. Neither the &quot;right to information&quot; as a\n facet of <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_96\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> nor the right to informational privacy\n as a facet of the right to privacy is absolute. The rights under\n <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_97\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> may be restricted on the grounds enumerated\n in clause (2) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_98\">Article 19.</a> The right to privacy and its\n numerous facets may be permissibly restricted where the\n abridgement is provided by law, pursues a legitimate State\n objective and complies with the principle of proportionality.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_52\"> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"131078228\" id=\"span_57\">47.     The Constitution Bench, by referring to Subhash\n Chandra Agarwal Vs Supreme Court of <a href=\"/doc/131078228/\" id=\"a_99\">India3</a> (supra), in\n which Mr. Agarwal had sought for details of medical facilities\n availed by Judges and their family members in the preceding\n three years, the Court held that certain category of\n information such as medical information, details of personal\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_58\"> 3</span>\n         2018 11 SCC 634\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_59\">                               Page 26 of 35</span>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_60\">::: Uploaded on - 10/07/2025                     ::: Downloaded on - 10/07/2025 22:21:41 :::</span>\n                                                  WP-10909-2023+-J-F.DOCX\n\n\n\n relations, employee records, and professional income can be\n classified as personal information. The question of whether\n such information must be disclosed has to be determined by\n the CPIO on a case-to-case basis, depending on the public\n interest demonstrated in favour of disclosure.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_53\"> 48.     The Constitution Bench also dealt with the aspect of\n &quot;public interest&quot; especially in the context of qualified\n exemptions for disclosure of information. For example,\n <a href=\"/doc/1838023/\" id=\"a_100\">Section 8(1)(d)</a> or (e) exempts disclosure of information\n specified therein, unless the competent authority is satisfied\n that larger public interest warrants the disclosure of such\n information. The Court held that the factors that weigh in\n favour of disclosure in &quot;public interest&quot; are specific to each\n unique case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_54\"> 49.     The issues raised in this Petition will have to be\n addressed in the light of the provisions of the RTI as explained\n by the Hon&#x27;ble Constitution Bench in the above-referred\n decisions.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_55\"> 50.     Regarding the first query, the CPIO was directed to\n provide workable links to Mr. Agarwal. This portion of the\n impugned order has neither been challenged by SEBI nor by\n Mr. Agarwal. Therefore, there is no need to address any issues\n arising from the first query.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_56\"> 51.     Even otherwise, we are satisfied that this information is\n mainly contained in the <a href=\"/doc/220169/\" id=\"a_101\">Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act</a>\n 1956       and      Rules     1957   and   the    Securities        Contracts\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_61\">                                 Page 27 of 35</span>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_62\">::: Uploaded on - 10/07/2025                       ::: Downloaded on - 10/07/2025 22:21:41 :::</span>\n                                                WP-10909-2023+-J-F.DOCX\n\n\n\n (Regulation) (Stock Exchanges and Clearing Corporations)\n Regulations 2018. Such information is thus available in the\n public domain.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_57\"> 52.     Query No. 2 concerns file notings, correspondence and\n other documents on framing policy, guidelines, etc, as referred\n to in query (1) above for SEBI having its role in appointing\n PIDs on boards of MII, BSE, NSE, MCX and MCX Clearing\n Corporation Limited. The SEBI invoked the exemption under\n <a href=\"/doc/1494553/\" id=\"a_102\">Section 8(1)(e)</a> of the RTI Act by urging that this would\n contain information held by SEBI in its fiduciary capacity.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_58\"> 53.     In the body of the CIC&#x27;s impugned order, the\n observations suggest that the CIC accepted SEBI&#x27;s contention\n that the information which was sought was held by SEBI in its\n fiduciary capacity. Such information includes commercial\n information, the disclosure of which may harm the interests of\n the suppliers of such information. The CIC assessed the\n institutional impact of disclosing this information in the\n instant case and opined that the possibility of harm or injury\n emanating from the disclosure outweighed the public interest.\n Therefore, the exemption under <a href=\"/doc/1494553/\" id=\"a_103\">Section 8(1)(e)</a> of the RTI, as\n claimed by the SEBI, was upheld and allowed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_59\"> 54.     In the directions issued in the impugned order under the\n caption of &quot;decision&quot;, there is no reference to any decision or\n direction on point No. 2, which dealt with query No. 2. The\n information sought by Mr. Agarwal under query No. 2 is a\n little confusing and vague. The information sought relates to\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_63\">                               Page 28 of 35</span>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_64\">::: Uploaded on - 10/07/2025                     ::: Downloaded on - 10/07/2025 22:21:41 :::</span>\n                                                  WP-10909-2023+-J-F.DOCX\n\n\n\n file noting, correspondence, and other documents &quot; on framing\n policy, guidelines etc.&quot; as referred to in query (1) above for\n SEBI having its role in appointing PIDs on the Boards of &quot;MII,\n BSE, NSE, MCX and MCX Clearing Corporation Limited.&quot;\n Nevertheless, such information can be said to have been held\n in fiduciary capacity by the SEBI. Because this would include\n information supplied by candidates to be considered for\n appointment as PIDs in good faith and candour, trusting that\n confidentiality would be maintained. Therefore, we do not\n think that any case is made out to interfere with the\n impugned order to the extent it rejects information regarding\n query No. 2.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_60\"> 55.     Query No.3 concerns &quot;File-notings, correspondence and\n other documents on granting approval by SEBI to appoint\n PIDs on boards of MII, BSE, NSE, MCX and MCX Clearing\n Corporation Limited from 01.01.2019 till 15.06.2021&quot; The\n SEBI invoked the exemption under <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_104\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the RTI\n Act, on the ground that the documents about the grant of\n approval of PIDs constituted personal information of the\n Applicants. By the impugned order, the CIC has partially\n upheld SEBI&#x27;s defence. However, the CPIO was directed to\n provide a list of selected and rejected candidates, invoking the\n severability principle in <a href=\"/doc/580445/\" id=\"a_105\">Section 10</a> of the RTI Act, after\n ensuring        that     the   personal   information        and      sensitive\n information was redacted and masked.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_65\">                                 Page 29 of 35</span>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_66\">::: Uploaded on - 10/07/2025                       ::: Downloaded on - 10/07/2025 22:21:41 :::</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_61\">                                                   WP-10909-2023+-J-F.DOCX\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_62\"> 56.     The information sought under Query No. 3 could\n include personal information about the various Applicants or\n candidates desirous of being appointed as PIDs on the stock\n exchange. The list of those appointed as PIDs would obviously\n be in the public domain, and obtaining this information would\n pose no difficulty. Similarly, if the Applicant had entertained\n any doubts about the appointed PIDs not fulfilling the\n prescribed qualifications, information in that regard could\n have been sought, and the exemption under <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_106\">Section 8(1)(j)</a>\n would        not     have     applied.   However,       seeking        omnibus\n information about not only those appointed as PIDs but also\n those who may not have been appointed as PIDs could, in a\n given case, cause an unwarranted invasion of the privacy of\n such persons or candidates. The CIC has also taken into\n account the public interest aspect. The CIC&#x27;s order is\n vulnerable to the extent it directs the supply of a list of\n rejected candidates, even though such rejected candidates\n would be third parties as defined under <a href=\"/doc/436180/\" id=\"a_107\">Section 2(n)</a> of the\n RTI Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_63\"> 57.     If information regarding the rejected candidates,\n including their names, is to be disclosed, the third-party\n procedure prescribed under <a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_108\">Section 11</a> must be followed.\n Once again, this is not a case of selection through a\n competitive examination or by a departmental promotion\n committee or departmental selection committee, where\n considerations would differ. The subjective element in such\n selections is minimal, and the results of written tests or marks\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_67\">                                  Page 30 of 35</span>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_68\">::: Uploaded on - 10/07/2025                        ::: Downloaded on - 10/07/2025 22:21:41 :::</span>\n                                                  WP-10909-2023+-J-F.DOCX\n\n\n\n obtained        in     interviews   are   usually     made        public.

However, the position regarding the appointments of\n PIDs is qualitatively different. Typically, professionals and\n experts from the field are considered and evaluated. Those\n not selected or appointed may not necessarily be disqualified\n or less meritorious than those selected. But there might be\n requirements concerning diversity or domain expertise. There\n may be several factors relevant to their non-selection. They\n may not want these matters to be made public. Their privacy\n concerns cannot be disregarded without giving them an\n opportunity to oppose such disclosures, if they so choose. The\n provisions in <a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_109\">Section 11</a>, which are mandatory, cannot be\n avoided or bypassed in such situations.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_65\"> 59.     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"131078228\" id=\"span_69\">In the case of CPIO V/s. <a href=\"/doc/131078228/\" id=\"a_110\">Subhash Chandra Agarwal</a>\n (supra), the Applicants had sought copies of correspondence\n exchanged between constitutional authorities, together with\n file-notings relating to the appointment of Supreme Court\n Judges, superseding the seniority of some High Court Judges.\n The Court held that such information falls within the meaning\n of &quot;third party information&quot; and the procedure under <a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_111\">Section\n 11</a> must be complied with in arriving at a determination.\n Therefore, the matter was remanded to the CPIO to examine\n it afresh, following the procedure prescribed under <a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_112\">Section 11</a>\n of the RTI Act.</span>\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_70\">                                 Page 31 of 35</span>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_71\">::: Uploaded on - 10/07/2025                       ::: Downloaded on - 10/07/2025 22:21:41 :::</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_66\">                                                WP-10909-2023+-J-F.DOCX\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_67\"> 60.     Therefore, insofar as Query No.3 is concerned, we set\n aside the CIC&#x27;s impugned order and remand the matter to the\n CPIO to consider Mr Agarwal&#x27;s request afresh by following the\n provisions of <a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_113\">Section 11</a>.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_68\"> 61.

The\n impugned order, by applying the exemption under <a href=\"/doc/1838023/\" id=\"a_114\">Section\n 8(1)(d)</a> has not granted full inspection but only directed that\n concluding comments/final findings (year-wise) be provided\n in public interest. Again, we note that the annual inspection\n reports would include information about stock exchanges,\n such as BSE and NSE.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_69\"> 62.     Mr Bhatt argued that these annual inspection reports are\n detailed and cover a variety of activities and parameters,\n including cybersecurity and measures to prevent leaks of\n sensitive pricing information. He contended that even\n revealing concluding comments or final findings based on\n vague and broad queries would not serve the public interest.\n In any case, he maintained that such information could never\n have been ordered for disclosure without following the\n procedure required by <a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_115\">Section 11</a> of the RTI Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_70\"> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"86904342\" id=\"span_72\">63.
