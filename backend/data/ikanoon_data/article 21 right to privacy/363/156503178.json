APP argued on sentence and submits that already accused has been \n\nacquitted for the offence<a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_3\"> u/s 376</a> IPC.   He is only convicted for the offence<a href=\"/doc/180217/\" id=\"a_4\"> u/s  \n\n506</a>­II  read with 354 <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_5\">IPC</a>.   ld. APP further submits that a severe punishment be \n\nawarded to him, since unchastity to a woman, is punishable with imprisonment of \n\neither description for a term which may extend to  seven years, or with fine, or \n\nwith both under <a href=\"/doc/180217/\" id=\"a_6\">section 506</a> Part II of <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_7\">IPC</a>.\n\n        Contrary to the submissions of ld. APP,   Ld. counsel for the accused \n\nhas   argued   and   submits   that   accused   is   aged   about   50     years   old.   He   is   a \n\ngovernment   servant,   serving   in   Northern   Railway   as   Accountant.         He   again \n\nsubmits that   accused is a married person and he has one boy, who is college \n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                   1 \n going student.       Ld. counsel further submits that prosecutrix was   his sister­in­\n\nlaw.     The offence   u/s 376 <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_8\">IPC</a> could not be proved on record hence, accused  \n\nhas been acquitted for the offence<a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_9\"> u/s 376</a> IPC.   Ld. Counsel again submits that \n\nwife of accused is ailing women and she under needs accused with her to look \n\nafter her.    He further submits that accused has no previous criminal history and \n\nhe  has never misused the liberty of bail and never tried to cause any interruption \n\nin   the   administration   of   justice.         He   is   in   JC   w.e.f.   28.08.2012.       On   these \n\ngrounds ld. Counsel for the accused prayed for release of accused on probation \n\nof good conduct<a href=\"/doc/243306/\" id=\"a_10\"> u/s 360</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1515807/\" id=\"a_11\">361</a> Cr. PC.   Ld. Counsel again submits that <a href=\"/doc/14315/\" id=\"a_12\">section \n\n4</a> of Probation Act is also applicable for the release of accused on probation of \n\ngood conduct.  In support of his contentions Ld. Counsel has also relied upon the \n\njudgment &#x27;Bishnu Deo Shaw  V. State of West Bengal - AIR 1979 Supreme court \n\n964.\n\n        Again controverting the submissions of ld. Counsel for accused, ld. APP \n\nsubmits that after enactment of <a href=\"/doc/167447/\" id=\"a_13\">Probation Act</a>  section 360 and 361 C4. PC are \n\ninoperative in view of the judgment &#x27;Guljar vs. State 2007  (1) SCC 619&#x27;.   \n\n        ld. Counsel for accused again submits that reconciliation and harmonious \n\nrelationship should be maintained between sections 360, 361 Cr. PC and <a href=\"/doc/14315/\" id=\"a_14\">section \n\n4</a> of Probation Act.  \n\n        Keeping in view the present scenario and the facts and circumstances of \n\nthe case to seek a balance between justice and injustice is very vulnerable task. \n\nHowever, moderation is the best means to arrive at for the best conclusion.   I do \n\nnot agree with the contentions ld. Counsel for the accused to release the convict \n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                         2 \n on probation of good conduct precisely for the reasons that accused has been \n\nacquitted against the charge of rape and he has been convicted for the offence \n\nu/s 506 part II read with 354 <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_15\">IPC</a>  and the prosecutrix in this case happens to be \n\nthe real sister of wife of accused.   In light of these facts and circumstances of the  \n\ncase,   to   my   view   ends   of   justice   shall   be   met   if  accused   is   sentenced   to \n\nundergo 3 years R.I. for the offence under section 506­II  read with 354 <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_16\">IPC</a> \n\nand to pay a fine of Rs.25,000/­ in default six months further R.I.

Briefly facts of the prosecution case are that prosecutrix is the real sister \n\n  of   wife   of   the   accused.     In   the   year   1997   marriage   of   brother   of \n\n  prosecutrix   was   finalized   and   she   was   accompanied   by   accused   for \n\n  shopping.     She   has   been   to   Ashok     Vihar   flat   by   accused   on   some \n\n  pretext   and   she   was   raped   by   accused   i.e.   her   brother­in­law   (Jeeja) \n\n  firstly in the year 1997 at his Ashok Vihar flat under threat on the point of \n\n  knife.       Again   it   has   been   alleged   that   in  the   year   2001,   when   PW1 \n\n  Seema   Sharma   was   working   in   a   private   company   namely   Adroid \n\n  Financial Services, Anand Vihar, on one day when she reached Anand \n\n  Vihar   Railway   Station,     accused   came   there   and   asked   her   to \n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                                                                           4 </span>\n   accompany him and when she refused to go along with him accused \n\n  took   her   forcibly   under   threat   to   his   rented   room   situated   in   Chander \n\n  Nagar, in a TSR  and forcibly committed sex with PW1 Seema Sharma. \n\n  She alleged that accused was in the habit of taking her   forcibly to this \n\n  rented   accommodation.     He   forcibly   committed   rape   upon   her   for   2/3 \n\n  times in the period of 2/3 months.

Having gone through the statement of prosecutrix PW1 it has come on \n\n  record that accused is brother­in­law (Jeeja) of the prosecutrix.   He had \n\n  impressed the family members of the prosecutrix.     Family members of \n\n  the prosecutrix used to give due respect to the accused.   But  accused \n\n  had a evil eye on the prosecutrix and he seduced the prosecutrix forcibly \n\n  under threats and committed rape upon her at several times.

Due   to \n\n  finalization of the marriage of Ravi Sharma,  PW1 Seema Sharma used \n\n  to go along with accused for making purchases.

At that time his wife \n\nNeelam Sharma was not present in the flat   as   she was in Sahibabad \n\ni.e. at her parental house.

She further deposed that accused \n\nstated that he would use these nude photographs at some appropriate \n\ntime.

PC  was recorded in which the defence of accused was of denial in \n\n  simplicitor.   However,   no   defence   evidence   was   led   by   the   accused. \n\n  Accused pleaded that he is  innocent and he has been falsely implicated \n\n  in this case.  He did not commit any rape.   He further took plea that  this \n\n  case   has   been   filed   to   defame   and   to   cause   mental   and   physical \n\n  sufferings to him.   Prosecutrix is younger sister of his wife. She is 10 \n\n  years younger to him. When she wrote him letters expressing love, he \n\n  admonished her and warned her not to write such letters.  His wife also \n\n  admonished her and asked her not to repeat such acts of writing such \n\n  letters.  In 1998, the engagement of his brother in law Ravi Bhushan took \n\n  place.  At that time, his father in law, mother in law and both brothers in \n\n  law   namely   Ravi   Bhushan   and   Brij   Bhushan   came   to   his   house   and \n\n  borrowed   Rs.10,000/­   and   gold   ornaments   weighing   10   Tolas   with   a \n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                                                                                   16 </span>\n   promise   to   return   after   Gaud   Ceremony.       Accused   pleaded   that   on \n\n  demand,   they   refused   to   return   money   and   ornaments   and   out   of \n\n  revenge, they filed this false case against him.   He further pleaded that \n\n  all these facts were apprised to Hon&#x27;ble Delhi High Court at the time of \n\n  seeking anticipatory bail. Subsequently, complaint was filed by his wife \n\n  against her mother, father and both brothers in law at PS Ashok Vihar, \n\n  which was withdrawn due to pressure from elders of his wife&#x27;s family.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_25\">17.Arguments were heard at length.  It is argued by the  ld. Counsel for the \n\n  accused that  there is no specific date mentioned for the first and second \n\n  incident   which   is   a   highly   important   fact   considering   they   were   life \n\n  altering incidents. The complainant in her examination­in­chief (page 1,  \n\n  paragraph 2, line 6) clearly stated that she cannot recollect the date or \n\n  the month of the first alleged incident. It is also an important fact that the \n\n  complainant, at the time of so alleged first incident, was well educated \n\n  and a mature person. Hence, it is highly improbable that if such incident \n\n  had taken place, she would not be remembering the date or even the \n\n  month of such incidents. These vague allegations and statements clearly \n\n  demonstrate that it is just a story and not the truth.       Ld. Counsel for \n\n  accused again submitted that the place of first alleged incident i.e. 43­A \n\n  Ashok Vihar, was alleged to have been occupied by the accused, but the \n\n  family of the accused was actually residing in that house at the time of \n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                                                                                       17 </span>\n   alleged offence and the complainant was not residing at the aforesaid \n\n  address. In the complaint (Page 1, paragraph 4, line 2) the complainant \n\n  has specifically stated that the wife of the accused was at Sahibabad i.e. \n\n  at her parent&#x27;s house and that no one was present at the said house in \n\n  Ashok Vihar at the time of the alleged incident. The complainant in her \n\n  examination­in­chief   (page   1,   paragraph   2,   Line   10),   had   repeatedly \n\n  quoted   the   accused   saying   &quot;from   my   house&quot;   on   the   date   of   the   first \n\n  incident, but had also admitted in cross­examination (page 8, paragraph  \n\n  2,   line   3),   the   knowledge,   that   the   accused   was   not   residing   in   43­A \n\n  Ashok   Vihar   from   1995­1998.   These   statements   by   the   complainant \n\n  herself are contradictory to the core and do not inspire any confidence.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_26\">18.ld. Counsel for the accused further argued and submitted that regarding \n\n  the incidents of Chandar Nagar, first of all, no date is mentioned. The \n\n  complainant is unable to remember the address or identify the locality or \n\n  even any landmark such as a park, hospital, school etc., which is highly \n\n  improbable if the complainant was taken to that specific location on more \n\n  than one occasion (Examination­in­chief, page 1, paragraph 1, line 1). It \n\n  is important to note that the accused never had any connection with any \n\n  residence in Chandar Nagar and also that the complainant never raised \n\n  any   alarm   in   the   mode   of   transportation   taken   at   the   time   of   such \n\n  incidents (Cross­examination, page 9, paragraph 3, line 3).  In addition, \n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                                                                                           18 </span>\n regarding the mode of transportation, it is important to note that no TSR \n\ntravels across the border of Delhi­Uttar Pradesh. Hence the statements \n\nmade by the complainant are full of vague statements and allegations \n\nwhich do not hold any shred of truth in them.       Again it is argued and \n\nsubmitted that the alleged incident of 19­06­2003, has huge discrepancy \n\nregarding the chain of events between the complaint and the statement \n\nu/s 164.    Such as  in Complaint it has been alleged that First rape was \n\ncommitted,   then,   coffee   was   given   to   her   to   drink   after   which,   she \n\nbecame unconscious and then photograph were claimed to have been \n\ntaken  while in Statement<a href=\"/doc/497457/\" id=\"a_23\"> u/s 164</a> Cr.P.C: First coffee was given to her \n\nto   drink,   than   photographs   were   alleged   to   have   been   taken.   No \n\nmentioning of rape being committed in that incident.   On these grounds \n\nld. Counsel further submitted that these discrepancies in the statements \n\nof the complainant are grave as such chain of events cannot be easily \n\nforgotten.   Hence   these   statements   made   by   the   complainant   do   not \n\ninspire confidence.   Ld. Counsel again submitted that  complainant has \n\nadmitted   in   cross­examination  that   she   has   never   actually   seen   the \n\nphotographs herself. She had also admitted in cross­examination that, \n\nshe could not identify the camera which was shown and alleged to have \n\nbeen used for taking the photographs.      Ld. Counsel further argued and \n\nsubmitted that in the Cross­examination it has come on record that she \n\nonly went to shopping with the accused once or twice. \n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                                                                                     19 </span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_27\"> 19.Ld. Counsel again submitted that the last incident was reported to have \n\n  taken   place   on   19.06.2003.   On   26.06.2003   a   notification   regarding \n\n  advertisement of posts in railways was advertised. Two separate forms \n\n  were   filed   (Ex.PW1/DD   and   Ex.PW1/DE).   In   both   forms,   the \n\n  correspondence address was that of the accused instead of her owns. \n\n  The contents of the admit card was admitted to have been hers  but, the \n\n  complainant denied the fact of filing such application completely in cross­\n\n  examination. All these discrepancies and bizarre coincidents and facts \n\n  admitted   by   the   complainant   do   not   inspire   much   confidence   of   the \n\n  statement made by the complainant.   Ld. Counsel again submitted that \n\n  with regard to the torn pieces of letter presented by the accused  that in \n\n  the cross­examination, complainant admitted to have been written by her \n\n  but alleged to have been dictated by the accused. The contents of this \n\n  letter are very frank and obscene and no person in their right mind will \n\n  allow any other person to have such letters against their will. It is also \n\n  important   to   note   that   these   pieces   of   letters   were   not   mentioned   or \n\n  presented by the prosecution. It is only upon being confronted by these \n\n  letters  in cross­examination  that the complainant made such admission. \n\n  Hence even this statement by the complainant raises certain suspicion \n\n  on the credibility of the story made by her but definitely does not inspire \n\n  any confidence in the same.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                                                                                         20 </span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_29\"> 20.Ld.   Counsel   further   stated   that   greeting   cards   presented   in   cross­\n\n  examination (Ex.PW1/DA, Ex.PW1/DB AND Ex.PW1/DC) by the accused \n\n  have been admitted by the complainant and taken on record by the court \n\n  to have been sent to accused by the complainant from 1997­2003.

Seeking  corroboration  of  her  statement \n                    before relying upon the same, as a rule, in such cases amounts to \n                    adding  insult  to   injury.     Why  should  the   evidence  of  a  girl  or   a \n                    woman who complains of rape of sexual molestation, be viewed \n                    with doubt, disbelief or suspicion?     The court while appreciating \n                    the evidence of a prosecutrix may look for some assurance of her \n                    statement to satisfy its judicial conscience, since she is a witness \n                    who is interested in the outcome of the charge leveled by her, but \n                    there is no requirement of law to insist upon corroboration of her \n                    statement to base conviction of an accused.     The evidence of a \n                    victim of sexual assault stands almost at par with the evidence on \n                    an injured witness and to an extent is even more reliable.  Just as \n                    a witness who has sustained some injury in the occurrence, which \n                    is not found to be self inflicted, is considered to be a good witness \n                    in the  sense  that  he is least likely  to shield  the real culprit,  the \n                    evidence of a victim of a sexual offence is entitled to great weight, \n                    absence of corroboration notwithstanding.  Corroborative evidence \n                    is not an imperative component of judicial credence in every case \n                    of rape.   Corroboration as a condition for judicial reliance on \n                    the testimony of the prosecutrix is not a requirement of law \n                    but  a  guidance  of  prudence  under  given   circumstances.    It \n                    must not be overlooked that a woman or a girl subjected to \n                    sexual   assault   is   not   an   accomplice   to   the   crime   but   is   a \n                    victim   of   another   person&#x27;s     lust   and   it   is   improper   and \n                    undesirable   to   test   her   evidence   with   a   certain   amount   of \n                    suspicion,   treating   her   as   if   she   were   an   accomplice. \n                    Inferences   have   to   be   drawn   from   a   given   set   of   facts   and \n                    circumstances with realistic diversity and not dead uniformity lest \n                    that type of rigidity I the shape of rule of law is introduced through \n                    a   new   form   of   testimonial   tyranny   making   justice   a   causality. \n                    Courts   cannot   cling   to   a   fossil   formula   and   insist   upon \n                    corroboration even if, taken as a whole, the case spoken of by the \n                    victim of sex crime strikes the judicial mind as probable.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_32\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1987122\" id=\"span_20\">In another case of  <a href=\"/doc/1987122/\" id=\"a_25\">S.

It has come on record that prosecutrix \n\n  first met with accused in the year 1997,  second time in the year 2001, on \n\n  11.10.2002 and on 19.06.2003 but nowhere the matters appears to have \n\n  been   reported   even   intermittently   which   indicates   that   no   sexual \n\n  intercourse   between   the   parties   took   place   against   the   wishes   of \n\n  prosecutrix  but  simultaneously   it   can   be   inferred   beyond   reasonable \n\n  doubt that at various occasions accused caused intrusion with intend to \n\n  outrage the modesty of the prosecutrix.

Being   PW9,   PW11   and   PW10   brothers   and \n\n  mother   appears   to   be   interested   witnesses   so   the   deposition   of \n\n  prosecutrix regarding taking out a knife by accused from his pocket on \n\n  first occasion in the year 1997 and threatening her if she did not accept \n\n  the offer of accused he would kill her and her family members,  is not \n\n  acceptable since this incident as deposed by PW1 took place in the year \n\n  1997 whereas the FIR of the present case was got recorded in the year \n\n  2003.       Besides,   no   specific   date   and   time   has   been   given   by   the \n\n  prosecutrix.       Hence,   in   absence   of   corroboration   from   independent \n\n  witnesses,   recording   of   conviction   against   accused   for   the   offence   of \n\n  rape   may   result   into   miscarriage   of   justice   due   to   the   fact   that   no \n\n  complaint   in   this   regard   was   made   to   any   one   prior   to   2003   as   the \n\n  incident of rape as alleged took place in the year 1997  vide deposition of \n\n  PW1 prosecutrix.   \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_60\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_61\">29.The deposition of PW1 prosecutrix that on\n                                               02.12.2003\n                                                           as soon as her \n  engagement was fixed with one boy, accused threatened her to cut into \n  pieces, vide her complaint in this regard which is Ex.PW1/A and duly \n  endorsed by IO vide endorsement Ex.PW20/A, can afford the conclusion \n  to   draw   the   inference   that   accused   caused   intrusion   in   the   life   of   the \n  prosecutrix and such act of accused causing threat  to disclose relations \n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">                                                                                             30 </span>\n  of   the   prosecutrix   to   the   boy,   certainly   goes   to   indicate   that   accused \n outraged the modesty of the prosecutrix by threatening her, which is an \n offence punishable u/s 506 ­II read with 354 <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_42\">IPC</a>.  In light of these facts \n and circumstances of the case and absence of corroboration from other \n material   independent   witnesses   the   deposition   of   prosecutrix   to   the \n extent of causing threat and intrusion into the life of the prosecutrix, is \n acceptable to the court as the corroboration is not a rule of law but the \n rule of prudence which culminated through the common law.   So to my \n view  under the present circumstances of the case the conviction for rape \n of   accused   in   absence   of   independent   corroboration   will   lead   to \n miscarriage  of justice.     However,  no  woman  in the  Indian ethos  and \n pathos and cultural  traditions will  tell  a lie regarding her modesty and \n chastity in the Society, so  the deposition of prosecutrix cannot be denied \n in toto but an inference can be drawn that if no rape has been proved by \n some   other   external   circumstances  yet    it   can   safely   be   inferred   that \n accused impacted the modesty of the prosecutrix which is an offence \n punishable u/s 506 Part II, <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_43\">IPC</a>.
