Two questions arise for consideration-first, the extent\n\nof power of the State Commission for Women constituted under\n\nSection 3 of the Orissa (State) Commission for Women Act, 1993\n\n(for short, `1993 Act&#x27;) and then, as to whether the High Court of\n\nOrissa was justified in issuing direction for deoxyribonucleic acid\n\ftest (DNA) of the child and the appellant who, according to the\n\nmother of the child, was its father suo motu. These questions\n\narise in this way. On May 15, 2007, Bhabani Prasad Jena-the\n\nappellant and Suvashree Nayak-respondent no. 2 got married.\n\nThe certificate of marriage was issued by the Marriage Officer,\n\nKhurda, Bhubaneswar on June 30, 2007 under <a href=\"/doc/1380380/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 13</a> of the\n\nSpecial Marriage Act, 1954 (for short, `1954 Act&#x27;). In less than\n\nthree months, to be precise, on August 7, 2007 the appellant filed\n\na petition under <a href=\"/doc/1247582/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 25(iii)</a> of the 1954 Act in the Court of\n\nDistrict Judge, Khurda, Bhubaneswar for a declaration that the\n\nmarriage between him and the respondent no. 2, registered on\n\nJune 30, 2007 was nullity and the said marriage has not been\n\nconsummated. In that matrimonial proceedings, the respondent\n\nno. 2 has filed written statement and traversed the allegations\n\nmade in the petition. She also claimed permanent alimony to the\n\ntune of Rs. 10,00,000/-. It is not necessary to refer to      the\n\nmatrimonial proceedings in detail; suffice, however, to observe\n\nthat the said proceedings are pending.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">3.         On December 30, 2008 the respondent no. 2 filed a\n\ncomplaint before Orissa (State) Commission for Women (for\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                                                2</span>\n\fshort, `State Commission&#x27;) alleging that she was married to the\n\nappellant and due to torture meted out to her by the appellant and\n\nhis family members and other issues, they have separated; she\n\nhas no source of income and she was pregnant. Based on the\n\nsaid complaint, the State Commission issued notices to both the\n\nparties. On April 20, 2009, the parties appeared before the State\n\nCommission. The appellant submitted his written reply to the\n\ncomplaint and stated      that marriage between the parties was\n\ninvalid due to fraud and coercion and that he has already applied\n\nto the District Court, Khurda for declaring the marriage null and\n\nvoid.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">4.      The Chairperson, State Commission passed an order on\n\nMay 11, 2009 issuing the following directions:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">        &quot;1.   Maintenance is compulsory for the petitioner,\n              as she has to have safe delivery and take\n              care of the baby.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">        2.

Amount to be\n              placed in the A/C of the mother directly by the\n              office of DDO (Drawl and disbursing officer).\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">        3.

The appellant challenged the aforesaid order by filing\n\na writ petition before the High Court of Orissa. The appellant took\n\nthe position that he has not fathered the child in the womb of\n\nrespondent no. 2 and there has been no relationship of husband\n\nand wife since      August 7, 2007 (the date of filing of the\n\nmatrimonial case before the District Judge, Khurda). It should be\n\nnoted here that a letter was sent by the respondent no. 2 to the\n\nChief Justice of Orissa High Court on June 9, 2009 giving the\n\nhistory of relationship between her and the appellant; their\n\nmarriage; harassment meted out to her by the appellant and his\n\nfamily members; advanced stage of her pregnancy and that she\n\nwas staying at Sanjivani Ma Ghar. She prayed for justice as her\n\ndelivery was expected on June 15, 2009. The vacation Judge\n\ntreated the said letter as writ petition and on June 9, 2009 itself\n\ndirected the Chief District Medical Officer, Bhubaneswer to admit\n\nthe respondent no. 2 in the Capital Hospital at the cost of the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                                                 4</span>\n\fState and the matter was ordered to be posted after vacation\n\nbefore the regular bench. It may also be noted that a day earlier\n\ni.e., on June 8, 2009 the Division Bench passed an interim order\n\nin the writ petition filed by the appellant staying the operation of\n\nclauses 2 and 3 of the order passed by the State Commission\n\nbut clarified that directions regarding maintenance and DNA are\n\nnot stayed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_9\">6.            On August 7, 2009, the High Court took up both writ\n\npetitions for consideration and passed an order directing that the\n\nDNA of the child shall be conducted in the SCB Medical College\n\nand Hospital, Cuttack and the appellant shall also give his blood\n\nsample for the purpose of DNA. This order is impugned in the\n\npresent appeals by special leave.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_10\">7.            The 1993 Act was enacted by the Orissa State\n\nLegislature to constitute a State Commission for Women and to\n\nprovide for matters connected with or incidental thereto.\n\nFunctions of the

It would be seen from <a href=\"/doc/789787/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 10</a> of the 1993 Act that\n\nthe State Commission has been authorized to take up studies in\n\nrespect of economic, educational and health situation of the\n\nwomen of the State and also the working conditions of women in\n\nthe factories, establishments, construction sites and make its\n\nrecommendations to the State Government.                    The State\n\nCommission is empowered to compile information in respect of\n\nthe offences against women and to coordinate with the State Cell\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                                                      8</span>\n\fand District Cells for atrocities against women. Further, the State\n\nCommission is competent to receive complaints in respect of the\n\nmatters specified in <a href=\"/doc/789787/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 10(1)(d)</a> and take up the grievances\n\nraised in the complaint/s with the concerned        authorities for\n\nappropriate remedial measures. The State Commission is also\n\ngiven role of assisting, training and orienting the non-Government\n\norganization in the State in legal counseling of poor women and\n\nenabling such women to get legal aid. Under clause (f) of <a href=\"/doc/789787/\" id=\"a_7\">Section\n\n10(1)</a>, the State Commission is authorized to inspect or cause to\n\nbe inspected, a jail, remand home, women&#x27;s institution or other\n\nplace of custody where women are kept as prisoners or otherwise\n\nand   take up with the concerned authorities these matters for\n\nremedial action. In other words, the State Commission is broadly\n\nassigned to take up studies on issues of economic, educational\n\nand healthcare that may help in overall development of the\n\nwomen of the State; gather statistics concerning offences against\n\nwomen; probe into the complaints         relating to atrocities on\n\nwomen, deprivation of women of their rights in respect of\n\nminimum wages, basic health, maternity rights, etc. and upon\n\nascertainment of facts take up the matter with the concerned\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                                                 9</span>\n\fauthorities for remedial measures; help women in distress as a\n\nfriend, philosopher and guide in enforcement of their legal rights.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_13\">However, no power or authority has been given to the State\n\nCommission to adjudicate or determine the rights of the parties.\n\nMr. Ranjan Mukherjee, learned counsel for respondent no. 2\n\nsubmitted that once a power has been given to the State\n\nCommission     to   receive   complaints   including   the   matter\n\nconcerning deprivation of women of their rights, it is implied that\n\nthe State Commission is authorized to decide these complaints.\n\nWe are afraid, no such implied power can be read into <a href=\"/doc/789787/\" id=\"a_8\">Section\n\n10(1)(d)</a> as suggested by the learned counsel. The provision\n\ncontained in <a href=\"/doc/789787/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 10(1)(d)</a> is expressly clear that the State\n\nCommission may receive complaints in relation to the matters\n\nspecified therein and on receipt of such complaints take up the\n\nmatter with the authorities concerned for appropriate remedial\n\nmeasures.     The 1993 Act has not entrusted the State\n\nCommission with the power to take up the role of a court or an\n\nadjudicatory tribunal and determine the rights of the parties. The\n\nState Commission is not a tribunal discharging the functions of a\n\njudicial character or a court. Learned counsel for respondent no.\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                                                 10</span>\n\f2 then referred to <a href=\"/doc/789787/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 10(3)</a> and submitted that the State\n\nCommission has been conferred with all the powers of a Civil\n\nCourt trying a suit. We are afraid, this is not at all proper reading\n\nof <a href=\"/doc/789787/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 10(3)</a>.     The expression,     `have all the powers of a\n\nCivil Court&#x27; in <a href=\"/doc/789787/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 10(3)</a> is qualified by the following words, `in\n\nrespect of the following matters&#x27;.     That is   to say,   the State\n\nCommission has powers of Civil Court trying a suit for the matters\n\nspecified in clauses (a) to (f) thereof and not for other purposes.\n\nIt is clear to us that the Legislature has not gone so far as to give\n\njurisdiction to the State Commission to make an order such as the\n\none that has been made. From whatever angle we may examine\n\nthe validity of the directions given by the State Commission in its\n\norder dated May 11, 2009, it appears to us that the said order\n\nwas outside the jurisdiction, power or competence of the State\n\nCommission. It was an order which the State Commission had\n\nno competence to make and, therefore, a void order. The High\n\nCourt instead of correcting that order went a step further and\n\ndirected that DNA of the child as well as the appellant shall be\n\nconducted.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                                                    11</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\">\f9.                Whether such a direction could be given by the High\n\nCourt?           Before we answer this question, we shall notice few\n\ndecisions of this Court dealing with the power of the Court in\n\ndirecting DNA. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1259126\" id=\"span_11\">In <a href=\"/doc/1259126/\" id=\"a_13\">Goutam Kundu v.

The husband disputed\n\nthe paternity of the child and prayed for blood group test of the\n\nchild to prove that he was not the father of the child.

Blood tests cannot show positively\n                  that any man is father, but they can show\n                  positively that a given man could or could not be\n                  the father. It is obviously the latter aspect that\n                  proves most valuable in determining paternity,\n                  that is, the exclusion aspect, for once it is\n                  determined that a man could not be the father,\n                  he is thereby automatically excluded from\n                  considerations of paternity.

That\n\ncase arose out of an application for divorce filed by the husband\n\nagainst the wife under <a href=\"/doc/917404/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 13(1)(iii)</a> of the Hindu Marriage\n\nAct, 1955. In other words, the husband claimed divorce on the\n\nground that wife has been incurably of unsound mind or has\n\nbeen suffering from mental disorder. The Court observed,\n\n&quot;Goutam Kundu is, therefore, not an authority for the proposition\n\nthat under no circumstances the Court can direct that blood tests\n\nbe conducted. It, having regard to the future of the child, has, of\n\ncourse, sounded a note of caution as regards mechanical passing\n\nof such order. In some other jurisdictions, it has been held that\n\nsuch directions should ordinarily be made if it is in the interest of\n\nthe child.&quot;            While dealing with the aspect   as to whether\n\nsubjecting a person to a medical test is violative of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_19\">Article 21</a> of\n\nthe Constitution of India, it was stated that the right to privacy in\n\nterms of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_20\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution is not an absolute right.\n\nThis Court summed up conclusions thus :</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_24\">\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">2</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">    (2003) 4 SCC 493\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                                                                   14</span>\n\f          &quot;1.

This is what this Court said :</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">          &quot;13. We may remember that <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 112</a> of the\n          Evidence Act was enacted at a time when the modern\n          scientific advancements with deoxyribonucleic acid\n          (DNA) as well as ribonucleic acid (RNA) tests were not\n          even in contemplation of the legislature. The result of a\n          genuine DNA test is said to be scientifically accurate.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_26\">          But even that is not enough to escape from the\n          conclusiveness of <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 112</a> of the Evidence Act e.g.\n          if a husband and wife were living together during the\n          time of conception but the DNA test revealed that the\n          child was not born to the husband, the conclusiveness\n          in law would remain irrebuttable. This may look hard\n          from the point of view of the husband who would be\n          compelled to bear the fatherhood of a child of which he\n          may be innocent. But even in such a case the law\n          leans in favour of the innocent child from being\n          bastardised if his mother and her spouse were living\n          together during the time of conception. Hence the\n          question regarding the degree of proof of non-access\n          for rebutting the conclusiveness must be answered in\n          the light of what is meant by access or non-access as\n          delineated above.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_27\">It was emphasized that DNA test is not to be directed as a matter\n\nof routine and only in deserving cases such a direction can be\n\ngiven.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"705395\" id=\"span_21\">12.               Recently, in the case of <a href=\"/doc/705395/\" id=\"a_26\">Ramkanya Bai v. Bharatram4</a>\n\ndecided by the Bench of which one of us, R.M.

In a matter where paternity of a child is in issue before\n\nthe court, the use of DNA is an extremely delicate and sensitive\n\naspect. One view is that when modern science gives means of\n\nascertaining the paternity of a child, there should not be any\n\nhesitation to use those means whenever the occasion requires.\n\nThe other view is that the court must be reluctant in use of such\n\nscientific advances and tools which result in invasion of right to\n\nprivacy of an individual and may not only be prejudicial to the\n\nrights of the parties but may have devastating effect on the child.\n\nSometimes the result of such scientific test may bastardise an\n\ninnocent child even though his mother and her spouse were living\n\ntogether during the time of conception. In our view, when there is\n\napparent conflict between the right to privacy of a person not to\n\nsubmit himself forcibly to medical examination and duty of the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                                                                  17</span>\n\fcourt to reach the truth, the court must exercise its discretion only\n\nafter    balancing the interests of the parties and on due\n\nconsideration whether for a just decision in the matter, DNA is\n\neminently needed. DNA in a matter relating to paternity of a\n\nchild should not be directed by the court as a matter of course or\n\nin a    routine manner, whenever such a request is made. The\n\ncourt has to consider diverse aspects including presumption\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 112</a> of the Evidence Act; pros and cons of such\n\norder and the test of `eminent need&#x27; whether it is not possible for\n\nthe court to reach the truth without use of such test.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_30\">14.         There is no conflict in the two decisions of this Court,\n\nnamely, Goutam Kundu1 and Sharda2 .         In Goutam Kundu1 , it\n\nhas been laid down that courts in India cannot order blood test as\n\na matter of course and such prayers cannot be granted to have\n\nroving inquiry; there must be strong prima facie case and court\n\nmust carefully examine as to what would be the consequence of\n\nordering the blood test. In the case of Sharda2 while concluding\n\nthat a matrimonial court has power to order a person to undergo a\n\nmedical test, it was reiterated that the court should exercise such\n\na power if the applicant has a strong prima facie case and there is\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">                                                                  18</span>\n\fsufficient material before the court. Obviously, therefore, any\n\norder for DNA can be given by the court only if a strong prima\n\nfacie case is made out for such a course. Insofar as the present\n\ncase is concerned, we have already held that the State\n\nCommission has no authority, competence or power to order\n\nDNA. Looking to the nature of proceedings with which the High\n\nCourt was concerned, it has to be held that            High Court\n\nexceeded its jurisdiction in passing the impugned order.\n\nStrangely, the High Court over-looked a very material aspect that\n\nthe matrimonial dispute between the parties is already pending in\n\nthe court of competent jurisdiction and all aspects concerning\n\nmatrimonial dispute raised by the parties <a href=\"/doc/705395/\" id=\"a_28\">in that case</a> shall be\n\nadjudicated and determined by that Court. Should an issue arise\n\nbefore the matrimonial court concerning the paternity of the child,\n\nobviously that court will be competent to pass an appropriate\n\norder at the relevant time in accordance with law. In any view of\n\nthe matter, it is not possible to sustain the order passed by the\n\nHigh Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_31\">15.
