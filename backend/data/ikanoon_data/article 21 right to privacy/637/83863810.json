The bank manager/officer and employees of any bank, nationalised/or\n             non-nationalised, are expected to act and discharge their functions in\n             accordance with the rules and regulations of the bank. Acting beyond one&#x27;s\n             authority is by itself a breach of discipline and trust and a misconduct. In the\n             instant case Charge 5 framed against the appellant is very serious and grave\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                                                                                  Page 8 of 28</span>\n             in nature. We have already extracted the relevant Rule which prohibits the\n            bank manager to sanction a loan to his wife or his relative or to any partner.\n            While sanctioning the loan the appellant did not appear to have kept this\n            aspect in mind and acted illegally and sanctioned the loan. He realised the\n            mistake later and tried to salvage the same by not encashing the draft issued\n            in the maiden name of his wife though the draft was issued but not encashed.\n            <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1992949\" id=\"span_14\">The decision to sanction a loan is not an honest decision. Rule 34(3)(1) is a\n            rule of integrity and, therefore, as rightly pointed out by Mr Salve, the\n            respondent Bank cannot afford to have the appellant as bank manager. The\n            punishment of removal awarded by the appellate authority is just and proper\n            in the facts and circumstances of the case. Before concluding, we may usefully\n            rely on the judgment <a href=\"/doc/1992949/\" id=\"a_65\">Regional Manager, U.P. SRTC v. Hoti Lal</a> [(2003) 3\n            SCC 605 : 2003 SCC (L&amp;S) 363] wherein this Court has held as under: (SCC\n            p. 614, para 10)\n\n            &quot;If the charged employee holds a position of trust where honesty and integrity\n            are inbuilt requirements of functioning, it would not be proper to deal with\n            the matter leniently. Misconduct in such cases has to be dealt with iron hands.\n            Where the person deals with public money or is engaged in financial\n            transactions or acts in a fiduciary capacity, the highest degree of integrity\n            and trustworthiness is a must and unexceptionable. Judged in that\n            background, conclusions of the Division Bench of the High Court do not\n            appear to be proper. We set aside the same and restore order of the learned\n            Single Judge upholding the order of dismissal.&quot; [emphasis suppllied]</span>\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_20\">      14.

If we analyse <a href=\"/doc/62140/\" id=\"a_71\">Section 2(h)</a> carefully it is obvious that the first part of\n            <a href=\"/doc/62140/\" id=\"a_72\">Section 2(h)</a> relates to authorities, bodies or institutions of self government\n            established or constituted (a) under the Constitution; (b) by any law of\n            Parliament; (c) by any law of State Legislature or (d) by notification made by\n            the appropriate Government. There is no dispute with regard to clauses (a)\n            to (c). As far as clause (d) is concerned it was contended on behalf of the\n            appellants that unless a notification is issued notifying that an authority, body\n            or institution of self-government is brought within the ambit of the Act, the\n            said Act would not apply. We are not impressed with this argument. The\n            notification contemplated in clause (d) is a notification relating to the\n            establishment or constitution of the body and has nothing to do with the Act.\n            Any authority or body or institution of self government, if established or\n            constituted by a notification of the Central Government or a State\n            Government, would be a public authority within the meaning of clause (d) of\n            <a href=\"/doc/62140/\" id=\"a_73\">Section 2(h)</a> of the Act.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">            16. We must note that after the end of sub-clause (d) there is a comma and a\n            big gap and then the definition goes on to say &quot;and includes any&quot; and\n            thereafter the definition reads as: &quot;(i) body owned, controlled or\n            substantially financed; (ii) non-government organisation substantially\n            financed, directly or indirectly by funds provided by the appropriate\n            Government;&quot; The words &quot;and includes any&quot;, in our considered view,\n            expand the definition as compared to the first part. The second part of the\n            definition is an inclusive clause which indicates the intention of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                                                                                 Page 10 of 28</span>\n legislature to cover bodies other than those mentioned in clauses (a) to (d) of\n<a href=\"/doc/62140/\" id=\"a_74\">Section 2(h)</a>.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">17. We have no doubt in our mind that the bodies and NGOs mentioned in\nsub-clauses (i) and (ii) in the second part of the definition are in addition to\nthe four categories mentioned in clauses (a) to (d). Clauses (a) to (d) cover\nonly those bodies, etc., which have been established or constituted in the four\nmanners prescribed therein. By adding an inclusive clause in the definition,\nParliament intended to add two more categories, the first being in sub-clause\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">(i), which relates to bodies which are owned, controlled or substantially\nfinanced by the appropriate Government. These can be bodies which may not\nhave been constituted by or under the Constitution, by an Act of Parliament\nor State Legislature or by a notification. Any body which is owned, controlled\nor substantially financed by the Government, would be a public authority.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">18. As far as sub-clause (ii) is concerned it deals with NGOs substantially\nfinanced by the appropriate Government. Obviously, such an NGO cannot be\nowned or controlled by the Government.

The principle of purposive construction of a statute is a well recognised\nprinciple which has been incorporated in our jurisprudence.

The provision should be construed in such\na manner as to ensure that the object of the Act is fulfilled. Obviously, if the\nlanguage of the Act is clear then the language has to be followed, and the\ncourt cannot give its own interpretation.

I say &quot;appear&quot; because, although Hart and Sachs\n      claim that the interpreter should imagine himself or herself in the\n      legislator&#x27;s shoes, they introduce two elements of objectivity: First, the\n      interpreter should assume that the legislature is composed of\n      reasonable people seeking to achieve reasonable goals in a reasonable\n      manner; and second, the interpreter should accept the non-rebuttable\n      presumption that members of the legislative body sought to fulfil their\n      constitutional duties in good faith.

Therefore, in our view, <a href=\"/doc/62140/\" id=\"a_81\">Section 2(h)</a> deals with six different\ncategories and the two additional categories are mentioned in sub-\nclauses (i) and (ii). Any other interpretation would make sub-clauses\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_25\">(i) and (ii) totally redundant because then an NGO could never be\ncovered. By specifically bringing NGOs it is obvious that the intention\nof Parliament was to include these two categories mentioned in sub-\nclauses (i) and (ii) in addition to the four categories mentioned in\nclauses (a) to (d). Therefore, we have no hesitation in holding that an\nNGO substantially financed, directly or indirectly, by funds provided\nby the appropriate Government would be a public authority amenable\nto the provisions of the Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_26\">23. NGO is not defined under the Act or any other statute as far as we\nare concerned. In fact, the term NGO appears to have been used for\nthe first time describing an international body which is legally\nconstituted but non-governmental in nature. It is created by natural or\nlegal entities with no participation or representation by the\nGovernment. Even NGOs which are funded totally or partially by the\nGovernments essentially maintain the NGO status by excluding\nGovernment representations in all their organisations. In some\njurisprudence, they are also referred to as civil society organisations.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_27\">24. A society which may not be owned or controlled by the\nGovernment, may be an NGO but if it is substantially financed directly\nor indirectly by the Government it would fall within the ambit of sub-\nclause (ii).\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">                                                             Page 13 of 28</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_28\">                     28. Another aspect for determining substantial finance is whether the\n                   body, authority or NGO can carry on its activities effectively without\n                   getting finance from the Government. If its functioning is dependent on\n                   the finances of the Government then there can be no manner of doubt\n                   that it has to be termed as substantially financed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_29\">                    29. While interpreting the provisions of the Act and while deciding\n                   what is substantial finance one has to keep in mind the provisions of\n                   the Act. <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_82\">This Act</a> was enacted with the purpose of bringing\n                   transparency in public dealings and probity in public life. If NGOs or\n                   other bodies get substantial finance from the Government, we find no\n                   reason why any citizen cannot ask for information to find out whether\n                   his/her money which has been given to an NGO or any other body is\n                   being used for the requisite purpose or not.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_30\">      16.    That the essence of &quot;substantial financing by appropriate government&quot; under\n<a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_83\">Section 2(h)</a> of the RTI Act is that the government should substantially finance a body for\nit to be called a &quot;public authority&quot;. It is needless to emphasize that government financing\nis done by public money i.e., government putting public money in a body. Thus, a body\nwhich runs substantially on public money comes within the definition of &quot;public authority&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">of <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_84\">RTI Act</a> in view of the fact that the money of public is involved and any body which uses\npublic money should run transparently.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_31\">      17.

The Complainant has primarily relied on the\nargument that since the Bank is performing public functions much like political parties and\nthat funding of the bank is through the deposits made by the public at large, the aspect of\nsubstantial funding by the Govt. be read into the matter. Here, it is relevant to refer to the\nfollowing observations of the Apex Court in the Thalappalam matter:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_63\">      &quot;6. The words &quot;substantially financed&quot; have been used in <a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_133\">Sections 2(h)(d)(i)</a> &amp; (ii),\nwhile defining the expression public authority as well as in <a href=\"/doc/425882/\" id=\"a_134\">Section 2(a)</a> of the Act, while\ndefining the expression &quot;appropriate Government&quot;. A body can be substantially financed,\ndirectly or indirectly by funds provided by the appropriate Government. The expression\n&quot;substantially financed&quot;, as such, has not been defined under the Act. &quot;Substantial&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_58\">means &quot;in a substantial manner so as to be substantial&quot;. In Palser v. Grimling (1948) 1\nAll ER 1, 11 (HL), while interpreting the provisions of Section 10(1) of the Rent and\nMortgage Interest Restrictions Act, 1923, the House of Lords held that &quot;substantial&quot; is\nnot the same as &quot;not unsubstantial&quot; i.e. just enough to avoid the de minimis principle. The\nword &quot;substantial&quot; literally means solid, massive etc. Legislature has used the expression\n&quot;substantially financed&quot; in <a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_135\">Sections 2(h)(d)(i)</a> and\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_59\">      (ii) indicating that the degree of financing must be actual, existing, positive and real\nto a substantial extent, not moderate, ordinary, tolerable etc.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_60\">      37. We often use the expressions &quot;questions of law&quot; and &quot;substantial questions of\nlaw&quot; and explain that any question of law affecting the right of parties would not by itself\nbe a substantial question of law. In Black&#x27;s Law Dictionary (6th Edn.), the word\n&#x27;substantial&#x27; is defined as &#x27;of real worth and importance; of considerable value; valuable.\nBelonging to substance; actually existing; real: not seeming or imaginary; not illusive;\nsolid; true; veritable. Something worthwhile as distinguished from something without\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">                                                                                  Page 24 of 28</span>\n value or merely nominal. Synonymous with material.&#x27; The word &#x27;substantially&#x27; has been\ndefined to mean &#x27;essentially; without material qualification; in the main; in substance;\nmaterially.&#x27; In the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary (5th Edn.), the word &#x27;substantial&#x27;\nmeans &#x27;of ample or considerable amount of size; sizeable, fairly large; having solid worth\nor value, of real significance; sold; weighty; important, worthwhile; of an act, measure\netc. having force or effect, effective, thorough.&#x27; The word &#x27;substantially&#x27; has been defined\nto mean &#x27;in substance; as a substantial thing or being; essentially, intrinsically.&#x27; Therefore\nthe word &#x27;substantial&#x27; is not synonymous with &#x27;dominant&#x27; or &#x27;majority&#x27;. It is closer to\n&#x27;material&#x27; or &#x27;important&#x27; or &#x27;of considerable value.&#x27; &#x27;Substantially&#x27; is closer to &#x27;essentially&#x27;.\nBoth words can signify varying degrees depending on the context.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_61\">      38. Merely providing subsidiaries, grants, exemptions, privileges etc., as such,\ncannot be said to be providing funding to a substantial extent, unless the record shows that\nthe funding was so substantial to the body which practically runs by such funding and but\nfor such funding, it would struggle to exist. The State may also float many schemes\ngenerally for the betterment and welfare of the cooperative sector like deposit guarantee\nscheme, scheme of assistance from NABARD etc., but those facilities or assistance cannot\nbe termed as &quot;substantially financed&quot; by the State Government to bring the body within\nthe fold of &quot;public authority&quot; under <a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_136\">Section 2(h)(d)(i)</a> of the Act. But, there are instances,\nwhere private educational institutions getting ninety five per cent grant-in-aid from the\nappropriate government, may answer the definition of public authority under <a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_137\">Section\n2(h)(d)(i)</a>.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_62\">      Further, considering the rhetoric interpretation which is being urged to be\naccorded by the Complainant to the elements of <a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_138\">Section 2(h)</a> of the RTI Act with reference\nto the Respondent bank, the following observations of the Court in the averred judgment\nfinds square applicability in the instant matter:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_64\">      &quot;42.

We are of the view that the High Court has given a complete go-bye to the above-\nmentioned statutory principles and gone at a tangent by mis- interpreting the meaning and\ncontent of <a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_145\">Section 2(h)</a> of the RTI Act. Court has given a liberal construction to expression\n&quot;public authority&quot; under <a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_146\">Section 2(h)</a> of the Act, bearing in mind the &quot;transformation of\nlaw&quot; and its &quot;ultimate object&quot; i.e. to achieve &quot;transparency and accountability&quot;, which\naccording to the court could alone advance the objective of the Act. Further, the High\nCourt has also opined that <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_147\">RTI Act</a> will certainly help as a protection against the\nmismanagement of the society by the managing committee and the society&#x27;s liabilities and\nthat vigilant members of the public body by obtaining information through the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_148\">RTI Act</a>,\nwill be able to detect and prevent mismanagement in time. In our view, the categories\nmentioned in <a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_149\">Section 2(h)</a> of the Act exhaust themselves, hence, there is no question of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\">                                                                                   Page 26 of 28</span>\n adopting a liberal construction to the expression &quot;public authority&quot; to bring in other\ncategories into its fold, which do not satisfy the tests we have laid down.
