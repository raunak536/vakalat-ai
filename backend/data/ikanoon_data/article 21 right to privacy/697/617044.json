The said information was passed on to PW-1, Parmar.  \nHe reduced the same in writing.  He in turn passed it placing same by \nreducing it to writing before A.D.

PW-1 along with two other officers, namely, Dhani and Petkar \nvisited the said hotel.  They came to know that the accused was staying in \nRoom No.306.  Two of the employees of the said hotel were asked to be \npanch witnesses.  The door of the said room was knocked;  Appellant \nopened it.  He allegedly was given an option to get himself searched in \npresence of a Gazetted Officer or a Magistrate.  He opted for the former.  He \nwas searched by the said officers.  A sum of Rs.4,25,000/- in cash and a fax \ncopy of a receipt of Green Carriers from Delhi showing the consignment of \nmedicine was found in the said room.  A xeroxed copy of the said fax \nmessage was retained.  \n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">3.\tIt appears that the statement of the accused was also recorded in terms \nof <a href=\"/doc/1752792/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 67</a> of the Act.  The consignment arrived as per the said receipt \nwithin a couple of days.  Respondent herein was arrested on 27th January, \n1997, inter alia, relying on or on the basis of recovery of the said fax \nmessage which was marked as Exhibit-8 and the purported xerox copy \nthereof which was marked as Exhibit-8A.  \n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_6\">4.\tThe learned Trial Judge relying on the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1926081/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 66</a> of the \nNDPS Act held the respondent guilty of commission of an offence under \n<a href=\"/doc/1330288/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 8(c)</a>, <a href=\"/doc/263398/\" id=\"a_7\">22</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1252855/\" id=\"a_8\">29</a> of the NDPS Act.

It invades the rights of an accused to a \nlarge extent.  It raises a presumption of a culpable mental state.  Ordinarily, \neven an accused may not be released on bail having regard to <a href=\"/doc/496325/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 37</a> of \nthe Act.  The Court has the power to publish names, address and business \netc. of the offenders.  Any document produced in evidence becomes \nadmissible.  A vast power of calling for information upon the authorities has \nbeen conferred by reason of <a href=\"/doc/1752792/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 67</a> of the Act.  \n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\">10.\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"795643\" id=\"span_4\">Interpretation and/or validity in regard to the power of search and \nseizure provided for under the said Act came up for consideration in <a href=\"/doc/795643/\" id=\"a_20\">Balbir \nSingh</a>&#x27;s case (supra), wherein it was held :</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_13\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"795643\" id=\"span_5\">&quot;11. \tIt is thus clear that by a combined reading of \n<a href=\"/doc/1439062/\" id=\"a_21\">Sections 41</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1841395/\" id=\"a_22\">42</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1374738/\" id=\"a_23\">43</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1609866/\" id=\"a_24\">51</a> of the NDPS Act and \n<a href=\"/doc/1693109/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 4</a> Cr. PC regarding arrest and search under \n<a href=\"/doc/1439062/\" id=\"a_26\">Sections 41</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1841395/\" id=\"a_27\">42</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1374738/\" id=\"a_28\">43</a>, the provisions of Cr. PC \nnamely Sections 100 and 165 would be applicable \nto such arrest and search. Consequently the \nPrinciples <a href=\"/doc/795643/\" id=\"a_29\">laid down by</a> various courts as discussed \nabove regarding the irregularities and illegalities in \nrespect of arrest and search would equally be \napplicable to the arrest and search under the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_30\">NDPS \nAct</a> also depending upon the facts and \ncircumstances of each case.</span> \n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_14\">12. But there are certain other embargos envisaged \nunder <a href=\"/doc/1439062/\" id=\"a_31\">Sections 41</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1841395/\" id=\"a_32\">42</a> of the NDPS Act. Only a \nmagistrate so empowered under <a href=\"/doc/1439062/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 41</a> can \nissue a warrant for arrest and search where he has \nreason to believe that an offence under Chapter IV \nhas been committed so on and so forth as \nmentioned therein. Under Sub-section (2) only a \nGazetted Officer or other officers mentioned and \nempowered therein can give an authorization to a \nsubordinate to arrest and search if such officer has \nreason to believe about the commission of an \noffence and after reducing the information, if any \ninto writing. Under <a href=\"/doc/1841395/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 42</a> only officers \nmentioned therein and so empowered can make the \narrest or search as provided if they have reason to \nbelieve from personal knowledge or information. \n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_15\">In both these provisions there are two important \nrequirments. One is that the Magistrate or the \nOfficers mentioned therein firstly be empowered \nand they must have reason to believe that an \noffence under Chapter IV has been committed or \nthat such arrest or search was necessary for other \npurposes mentioned in the provision. So far as the \nfirst requirement is concerned, it can be seen that \nthe Legislature intends to only certain Magistrates \nand certain Officers of higher rank and empowered \ncan act to effect the arrest or search. This is a \nsafeguard provided having regard to the deterrent \nsentences contemplated and with a view that \ninnocent persons are not harassed. Therefore if an \narrest or search contemplated under these \nprovisions of <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_35\">NDPS Act</a> has to be carried out, the \nsame can be done only by competent and \nempowered Magistrates or Officers mentioned \nthereunder.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_16\">11.\tPower to make search and seizure as also to arrest an accused is \nfounded upon and subject to satisfaction of the officer as the terms &quot;reason \nto believe&quot; have been used.  Such belief may be founded upon secret \ninformation that may be orally conveyed by the informant.  Draconian \nprovision which may lead to a harsh sentence having regard to the doctrine \nof &#x27;due process&#x27; as adumbrated under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_36\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India \nrequire striking of balance between the need of law and enforcement thereof, \non the one hand, and protection of citizen from oppression and injustice on \nthe other.  \n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"795643\" id=\"span_6\">12.\tThis Court in <a href=\"/doc/795643/\" id=\"a_37\">Balbir Singh</a> (supra) referring to Miranda v. Arizona \n[(1966) 384 US 436] while interpreting the provisions of the Act held that \nnot only the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/996365/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 165</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure \nwould be attracted in the matter of search and seizure but the same must \ncomply with right of the accused to be informed about the requirement to \ncomply with the statutory provisions.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_18\">13.\tRequirements of <a href=\"/doc/1841395/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 42</a> was read into <a href=\"/doc/1374738/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 43</a> of the NDPS \nAct.  A somewhat different view, however, was taken subsequently.  \nDecisions were rendered opining that in conducting search and seizure in \npublic place or a moving vehicle, provisions appended to sub-section (1) of \n<a href=\"/doc/1841395/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 42</a> would not be attracted.  Decisions were also rendered that in such \na case even sub-section (2) of <a href=\"/doc/1841395/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 42</a> need not be complied with.  \n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_19\">14.\t<a href=\"/doc/1374738/\" id=\"a_43\">Section 43</a>, on plain reading of the Act, may not attract the rigours of \n<a href=\"/doc/1841395/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 42</a> thereof.  That means that even subjective satisfaction on the part \nof the authority, as is required under sub-section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/1841395/\" id=\"a_45\">Section 42</a>, need not \nbe complied with, only because the place whereat search is to be made is a \npublic place.  If <a href=\"/doc/1374738/\" id=\"a_46\">Section 43</a> is to be treated as an exception to <a href=\"/doc/1841395/\" id=\"a_47\">Section 42</a>, it is \nrequired to be strictly complied with.  An interpretation which strikes a \nbalance between the enforcement of law and protection of the valuable \nhuman right of an accused must be resorted to.  A declaration to the effect \nthat the minimum requirement, namely, compliance of <a href=\"/doc/996365/\" id=\"a_48\">Section 165</a> of the \nCode of Criminal Procedure would serve the purpose may not suffice as \nnon-compliance of the said provision would not render the search a nullity.  \nA distinction therefor must be borne in mind that a search conducted on the \nbasis of a prior information and a case where the authority comes across a \ncase of commission of an offence under the Act accidentally or per chance.  \nIt is also possible to hold that rigours of the law need not be complied with \nin a case where the purpose for making search and seizure would be \ndefeated, if strict compliance thereof is insisted upon.  It is also possible to \ncontend that where a search is required to be made at a public place which is \nopen to the general public, <a href=\"/doc/1841395/\" id=\"a_49\">Section 42</a> would have no application but it may \nbe another thing to contend that search is being made on prior information \nand there would be enough time for compliance of reducing the information \nto writing, informing the same to the superior officer and obtain his \npermission as also recording the reasons therefor coupled with the fact that \nthe place which is required to be searched is not open to public although \nsituated in a public place as, for example, room of a hotel, whereas hotel is a \npublic place, a room occupied by a guest may not be.  He is entitled to his \nright of privacy.  Nobody, even the staff of the hotel, can walk into his room \nwithout his permission.  Subject to the ordinary activities in regard to \nmaintenance and/or house keeping of the room, the guest is entitled to \nmaintain his privacy.  The very fact that the Act contemplated different \nmeasures to be taken in respect of search to be conducted between sunrise \nand sunset, between sunset and sunrise as also the private place and public \nplace is of some significance.  An authority cannot be given an untrammeled \npower to infringe the right of privacy of any person.  Even if a statute \nconfers such power upon an authority to make search and seizure of a person \nat all hours and at all places, the same may be held to be ultra vires unless \nthe restrictions imposed are reasonable ones.  What would be reasonable \nrestrictions would depend upon the nature of the statute and the extent of the \nright sought to be protected.  Although a statutory power to make a search \nand seizure by itself may not offend the right of privacy but in a case of this \nnature, the least that a court can do is to see that such a right is not \nunnecessarily infringed.  Right of privacy deals with persons and not places.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"160470236\" id=\"span_7\">15.\tA person, if he does not break a law would be entitled to enjoy his life \nand liberty which would include the right not to be disturbed.  A right to be \nlet alone is recognized to be a right which would fall under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_50\">Article 21</a> of the \nConstitution of India.  This Court in <a href=\"/doc/160470236/\" id=\"a_51\">Sharda v. Dharampal</a> [(2003) 4 SCC \n493] dealt with right of privacy to a certain extent.</span>  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1068532\" id=\"span_8\">The question came up \nfor consideration in <a href=\"/doc/1068532/\" id=\"a_52\">District Registrar and Collector, Hyderabad &amp; Anr. v. \nCanara Bank &amp; Ors.</a> [(2005) 1 SCC 496] wherein the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/138782685/\" id=\"a_53\">Section \n73</a> of the Stamp Act, as amended by the State of Andhra Pradesh, was struck \ndown holding :</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">&quot;Once we have accepted in Gobind and in later \ncases that the right to privacy deals with &quot;persons \nand not places&quot;, the documents or copies of \ndocuments of the customer which are in a bank, \nmust continue to remain confidential vis-a-vis the \nperson, even if they are no longer at the customer&#x27;s \nhouse and have been voluntarily sent to a bank. If \nthat be the correct view of the law, we cannot \naccept the line of Miller 30 in which the Court \nproceeded on the basis that the right to privacy is \nreferable to the right of &quot;property&quot; theory. Once \nthat is so, then unless there is some probable or \nreasonable cause or reasonable basis or material \nbefore the Collector for reaching an opinion that \nthe documents in the possession of the bank tend \nto secure any duty or to prove or to lead to the \ndiscovery of any fraud or omission in relation to \nany duty, the search or taking notes or extracts \ntherefore, cannot be valid. The above safeguards \nmust necessarily be read into the provision relating \nto search and inspection and seizure so as to save it \nfrom any unconstitutionality.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\">16.\tIt is not in dispute that the said Act prescribes stringent punishment.  \nA balance, thus, must be struck in regard to the mode and manner in which \nthe statutory requirements are to be complied with vis-`-vis the place of \nsearch and seizure.  \n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_22\">17.\tThis Court times without number has laid great emphasis on recording \nof reasons before search is conducted on the premise that the same would the \nearliest version which would be available to a court of law and the accused \nwhile defending his prosecution.  The provisions contained in <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_54\">Chapter IV of \nthe Act</a> are a group of sections providing for certain checks on exercise of \nthe powers of the concerned authority which otherwise would have been \narbitrarily or indiscriminately exercised.  The statute mandates that the \nprosecution must prove compliance of the said provisions.  If no evidence is \nled by the prosecution, the Court will be entitled to draw the presumption \nthat the procedure had not been complied with.  For the said purpose, we are \nof the opinion that there may not be any distinction between a person&#x27;s place \nof ordinary residence and a room of a hotel.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_23\">18.\tIt may be placed on record that applying a sophisticated sense \nenhancing technology called thermal imaging, which when kept outside the \nresidential house of a person to ascertain as to whether the inmate has kept \nany narcotic substance or not has been held to be infringement of right of \nprivacy of the said person in the United States Supreme Court decision of \nDanny Lee Kyllo v.

An officer who received such information was bound to \nreduce the same in writing and not for the person who hears thereabout.  \nFurthermore, in this case, apart from proving the fax and the copy of a \nchallan nothing else has been proved.  The fax was illegible.  It allegedly \nwas received in the PCO run by PW-17.  He could not prove the contents of \nthe fax.  He also could not show when the same was received and from \nwhom.  It has not been shown that the accused was the person who obtained \nthe said fax from PW-17.  Furthermore, contents of the said documents had \nnot been proved.  In absence of the aforementioned details, the fax being \nillegible and its contents being not known, the question of the same being \nadmissible in evidence in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1752792/\" id=\"a_56\">Section 67</a> of the Act would not arise.  \nThe xeroxed copy of the said fax had not been proved in the strict sense of \nthe term.  No secondary evidence could have been led to prove another \nsecondary evidence.  Contents of document are required to be proved.  The \ncontents of a document could be held to have been proved in terms of \n<a href=\"/doc/1926081/\" id=\"a_57\">section 66</a> only when the contents are decipherable and not otherwise.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\">20.\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"309307\" id=\"span_9\">In <a href=\"/doc/309307/\" id=\"a_58\">R.V.F.

The \nState of Madras and Anr.</a> in support of his \nsubmission that a document not admissible in \nevidence, though-brought on record, has to be \nexcluded from consideration. We do not have any \ndispute with the proposition of law so <a href=\"/doc/1615015/\" id=\"a_60\">laid down in</a> \nthe abovesaid case. However, the present one is a \ncase which calls for the correct position of law \nbeing made precise. Ordinarily an objection to the \nadmissibility of evidence should be taken when it \nis tendered and not subsequently. The objections as \nto admissibility of documents in evidence may be \nclassified into two classes:- (i) an objection that the \ndocument which is sought to be proved is itself \ninadmissible in evidence; and (ii) where the \nobjection does not dispute the admissibility of the \ndocument in evidence but is directed towards the \nmode of proof alleging the same to be irregular or \ninsufficient. In the first case, merely because a \ndocument has been marked as &#x27;an exhibit&#x27;, an \nobjection as to its admissibility is not excluded and \nis available to be raised even at a later stage or \neven in appeal or revision. In the latter case, the \nobjection should be taken before the evidence is \ntendered and once the document has been admitted \nin evidence and marked as an exhibit, the objection \nthat it should not have been admitted in evidence \nor that the mode adopted for proving the document \nis irregular cannot be allowed to be raised at any \nstage subsequent to the marking of the document \nas an exhibit. The later proposition is a rule of fair \nplay. The crucial test is whether an objection, if \ntaken at the appropriate point of time, would have \nenabled the party tendering the evidence to cure \nthe defect and resort to such mode of proof as \nwould be regular. The omission to object becomes \nfatal because by his failure the party entitled to \nobject allows the party tendering the evidence to \nact on an assumption that the opposite party is not \nserious about the made of proof. On the other \nhand, a prompt objection does not prejudice the \nparty tendering the evidence, for two reasons; \nfirstly, it enables the Court to apply its mind and \npronounce its decision on the question of \nadmissibility then and there; and secondly, in the \nevent of finding of the Court on the mode of proof \nsought to be adopted going against the party \ntendering the evidence the opportunity of seeking \nindulgence of the Court for permitting a regular \nmode or method of proof and thereby removing the \nobjection raised by the opposite party, is available \nto the party leading the evidence. Such practice \nand procedure is fair to both the parties. Out of the \ntwo types of objections, referred to hereinabove in \nthe later case, failure to raise a prompt and timely \nobjection amounts to waiver of the necessity for \ninsisting on formal proof of a document, the \ndocument itself which is sought to be proved being \nadmissible in evidence. In the first case, \nacquiescence would be no bar to raising the \nobjection in superior Court.&quot;</span>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_27\">21.\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"976161\" id=\"span_11\">In <a href=\"/doc/976161/\" id=\"a_61\">Narayanaswamy Ravishankar v.

Further, as <a href=\"/doc/1841395/\" id=\"a_63\">Section 42</a> of the NDPS Act \nwas not applicable in the present case, the seizure \nhaving been effected in a public place, the question \nof non-compliance, if any, of the provisions of \n<a href=\"/doc/1841395/\" id=\"a_64\">Section 42</a> of the NDPS Act is wholly irrelevant. \nFurthermore, in the mahazar which was prepared, \nit is clearly stated that the seizure was made by PW \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">1. The mahazar was no doubt drawn by one S. \nJayanth. But, the contention of the learned Senior \nCounsel that the prosecution version is vulnerable, \nbecause Jayanth has not been examined, is of no \nconsequence because it is PW 1 who has \nconducted the seizure. With regard to the alleged \nnon-compliance of <a href=\"/doc/669884/\" id=\"a_65\">Section 57</a> of the NDPS Act, \nthe High Court has rightly noted that PW 3 has \nstated that the arrest of the accused was revealed to \nhis immediate superior officer, namely, the Deputy \nDirector.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\">22.\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"173350\" id=\"span_12\">In <a href=\"/doc/173350/\" id=\"a_66\">Abdul Rashid Ibrahim Mansuri v.

When the same decision considered the \nimpact of non-compliance with <a href=\"/doc/961083/\" id=\"a_67\">Section 50</a> it was \nheld that &quot;it would affect the prosecution case and \nvitiate the trial&quot;. But the Constitution Bench has \nsettled the legal position concerning that aspect in \n<a href=\"/doc/1438183/\" id=\"a_68\">State of Punjab v. Baldev Singh</a> the relevant \nportion of which has been extracted by us earlier. \nWe do not think that a different approach is \nwarranted regarding non-compliance with <a href=\"/doc/1841395/\" id=\"a_69\">Section \n42</a> also. If that be so, the position must be the \nfollowing :</span> \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">If the officer has reason to believe from personal \nknowledge or prior information received from any \nperson that any narcotic drug or psychotropic \nsubstance (in respect of which an offence has been \ncommitted) is kept or concealed in any building, \nconveyance or enclosed place, it is imperative that \nthe officer should take it down in writing and he \nshall forthwith send a copy thereof to his \nimmediate official superior. The action of the \nofficer, who claims to have exercised it on the \nstrength of such unrecorded information, would \nbecome suspect, though the trial may not vitiate on \nthat score alone. Nonetheless the resultant position \nwould be one of causing prejudice to the accused.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_29\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1591627\" id=\"span_14\">{See also <a href=\"/doc/1591627/\" id=\"a_70\">The State of West Bengal &amp; Ors.
