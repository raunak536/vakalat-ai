The issue reaches out to the foundation of a\n\nconstitutional culture based on the protection of human rights and enables this Court\n\nto revisit the basic principles on which our Constitution has been founded and their\n\nconsequences for a way of life it seeks to protect. This case presents challenges for\n\nconstitutional interpretation. If privacy is to be construed as a protected constitutional\n\nvalue, it would redefine in significant ways our concepts of liberty and the entitlements\n\nthat flow out of its protection.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_3\">\n\n2      Privacy, in its simplest sense, allows each human being to be left alone in a\n\ncore which is inviolable. Yet the autonomy of the individual is conditioned by her\n\nrelationships with the rest of society. Those relationships may and do often pose\n\nquestions to autonomy and free choice. The overarching presence of state and non-\n\nstate entities regulates aspects of social existence which bear upon the freedom of\n\nthe individual. The preservation of constitutional liberty is, so to speak, work in\n\nprogress. Challenges have to be addressed to existing problems. Equally, new\n\nchallenges have to be dealt with in terms of a constitutional understanding of where\n\nliberty places an individual in the context of a social order. The emergence of new\n\nchallenges is exemplified by this case, where the debate on privacy is being analysed\n\nin the context of a global information based society. In an age where information\n\ntechnology governs virtually every aspect of our lives, the task before the Court is to\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                            4</span>\n\f                                                                                 PART A\n\n\nimpart constitutional meaning to individual liberty in an interconnected world. While\n\nwe revisit the question whether our constitution protects privacy as an elemental\n\nprinciple, the Court has to be sensitive to the needs of and the opportunities and\n\ndangers posed to liberty in a digital world.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_4\">\n\n3      A Bench of three judges of this Court, while considering the constitutional\n\nchallenge to the Aadhaar card scheme of the Union government noted in its order\n\ndated 11 August 2015 that the norms for and compilation of demographic biometric\n\ndata by government was questioned on the ground that it violates the right to privacy.\n\nThe Attorney General for India urged that the existence of a fundamental right of\n\nprivacy is in doubt in view of two decisions : the first – M P Sharma v Satish Chandra,\n\nDistrict Magistrate, Delhi1 (“M P Sharma”) was rendered by a Bench of eight\n\njudges and the second, in Kharak Singh v State of Uttar Pradesh2 (“Kharak\n\nSingh”) was rendered by a Bench of six judges. Each of these decisions, in the\n\nsubmission of the Attorney General, contained observations that the Indian\n\nConstitution does not specifically protect the right to privacy. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1857950\" id=\"span_4\">On the other hand, the\n\nsubmission of the petitioners was that M P Sharma and Kharak Singh were founded\n\non principles expounded in <a href=\"/doc/1857950/\" id=\"a_1\">A K Gopalan v State of Madras3 (“Gopalan”</a>).</span> Gopalan,\n\nwhich construed each provision contained in the Chapter on fundamental rights as\n\nembodying a distinct protection, was held not to be good law by an eleven-judge\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">1</span>\n  (1954) SCR 1077\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">2</span>\n  (1964) 1 SCR 332\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">3</span>\n  AIR 1950 SC 27\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                               5</span>\n\f                                                                                       PART A\n\n\nBench in Rustom Cavasji Cooper v Union of India4 (“Cooper”). Hence the\n\npetitioners submitted that the basis of the two earlier decisions is not valid. Moreover,\n\nit was also urged that in the seven-judge Bench decision in Maneka Gandhi v Union\n\nof India5 (“Maneka”), the minority judgment of Justice Subba Rao in Kharak Singh\n\nwas specifically approved of and the decision of the majority was overruled.\n\n\n\n4      While addressing these challenges, the Bench of three judges of this Court took\n\nnote of several decisions of this Court in which the right to privacy has been held to\n\nbe a constitutionally protected fundamental right. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"501107\" id=\"span_9\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"377237\" id=\"span_10\">Those decisions include : <a href=\"/doc/377237/\" id=\"a_2\">Gobind\n\nv State of Madhya Pradesh6 (“Gobind”</a>), <a href=\"/doc/501107/\" id=\"a_3\">R Rajagopal v State of Tamil Nadu7\n\n(“Rajagopal”</a>) and People’s Union for Civil Liberties v Union of India8 (“PUCL”).\n\nThese subsequent decisions which affirmed the existence of a constitutionally\n\nprotected right of privacy, were rendered by Benches of a strength smaller than those\n\nin M P Sharma and Kharak Singh. Faced with this predicament and having due\n\nregard to the far-reaching questions of importance involving interpretation of the\n\nConstitution, it was felt that institutional integrity and judicial discipline would require\n\na reference to a larger Bench.

With due respect to all the learned Judges\n             who rendered the subsequent judgments - where right to privacy is\n             asserted or referred to their Lordships concern for the liberty of\n             human beings, we are of the humble opinion that there appears to\n             be certain amount of apparent unresolved contradiction in the law\n             declared by this Court.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_6\">             <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"377237\" id=\"span_18\">13.

Besides, the jurisprudential correctness\n\nof subsequent decisions holding the right to privacy to be a constitutionally protected\n\nright is to be determined. The basic question whether privacy is a right protected\n\nunder our Constitution requires an understanding of what privacy means.

Justice\n\nJagannadhadas, speaking for the Bench, held that a search or seizure does not\n\ninfringe the constitutional right guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_14\">Article 20(3)</a> of the Constitution:\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">                  “…there is no basis in the Indian law for the assumption that a search\n                  or seizure of a thing or document is in itself to be treated as compelled\n                  production of the same. Indeed a little consideration will show that the\n                  two are essentially different matters for the purpose relevant to the\n                  present discussion. A notice to produce is addressed to the party\n                  concerned and his production in compliance therewith constitutes a\n                  testimonial act by him within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_15\">Article 20(3)</a> as above\n                  explained. But a search warrant is addressed to an officer of the\n                  Government, generally a police officer. Neither the search nor the\n                  seizure are acts of the occupier of the searched premises. They are\n                  acts of another to which he is obliged to submit and are, therefore, not\n                  his testimonial acts in any sense.”10\n\n\n\n9         Having held that the guarantee against self-incrimination is not offended by a\n\nsearch and seizure, the Court observed that :\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">                  “A power of search and seizure is in any system of jurisprudence\n                  an overriding power of the State for the protection of social security\n                  and that power is necessarily regulated by law. When the\n                  Constitution makers have thought fit not to subject such\n                  regulation to constitutional limitations by recognition of a\n                  fundamental right to privacy, analogous to the Fourth\n                  Amendment, we have no justification to import it, into a totally\n                  different fundamental right, by some process of strained\n                  construction.

It embodies an abiding principle which\n                    transcends mere protection of property rights and expounds a\n                    concept of “personal liberty” which does not rest on any element\n                    of feudalism or on any theory of freedom which has ceased to be of\n                    value.”16         (emphasis supplied)\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_18\">16         Kharak Singh regards the sanctity of the home and the protection against\n\nunauthorized intrusion an integral element of “ordered liberty”.

It is\n                   said that the freedom to move freely is carved out of personal liberty\n                   and, therefore, the expression “personal liberty” in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_35\">Article 21</a>\n                   excludes that attribute. In our view, this is not a correct approach.\n                   Both are independent fundamental rights, though there is\n                   overlapping. There is no question of one being carved out of\n                   another. The fundamental right of life and personal liberty have\n                   many attributes and some of them are found in <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_36\">Article 19.</a> If a\n                   person&#x27;s fundamental right under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_37\">Article 21</a> is infringed, the State\n                   can rely upon a law to sustain the action; but that cannot be a\n                   complete answer unless the said law satisfies the test laid down in\n                   <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_38\">Article 19(2)</a> so far as the attributes covered by <a href=\"/doc/1142233/\" id=\"a_39\">Article 19(1)</a> are\n                   concerned. In other words, the State must satisfy that both the\n                   fundamental rights are not infringed by showing that there is a law\n                   and that it does amount to a reasonable restriction within the\n                   meaning of <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_40\">Article 19(2)</a> of the Constitution. But in this case no such\n                   defence is available, as admittedly there is no such law.

In this view, though the Constitution does\n\nnot expressly declare the right to privacy as a fundamental right, such a right is\n\nessential to personal liberty. The dissenting opinion places the matter of principle as\n\nfollows:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_23\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">             “In an uncivilized society where there are no inhibitions, only\n             physical restraints may detract from personal liberty, but as\n             civilization advances the psychological restraints are more effective\n             than physical ones. The scientific methods used to condition a\n             man&#x27;s mind are in a real sense physical restraints, for they\n             engender physical fear channelling one&#x27;s actions through\n             anticipated and expected grooves. So also the creation of\n             conditions which necessarily engender inhibitions and fear\n             complexes can be described as physical restraints. Further, the\n             right to personal liberty takes in not only a right to be free from\n             restrictions placed on his movements, but also free from\n             encroachments on his private life. It is true our Constitution does\n             not expressly declare a right to privacy as a fundamental right,\n             but the said right is an essential ingredient of personal liberty.\n             Every democratic country sanctifies domestic life; it is expected to\n             give him rest, physical happiness, peace of mind and security. In\n             the last resort, a person&#x27;s house, where he lives with his family, is\n             his “castle”; it is his rampart against encroachment on his personal\n             liberty. The pregnant words of that famous Judge, Frankfurter\n             J., in Wolf v. Colorado [[1949] 238 US 25] pointing out the\n             importance of the security of one&#x27;s privacy against arbitrary\n             intrusion by the police, could have no less application to an\n             Indian home as to an American one. If physical restraints on a\n             person&#x27;s movements affect his personal liberty, physical\n             encroachments on his private life would affect it in a larger degree.\n             Indeed, nothing is more deleterious to a man&#x27;s physical happiness\n             and health than a calculated interference with his privacy. We\n             would, therefore, define the right of personal liberty in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_44\">Article 21</a> as\n             a right of an individual to be free from restrictions or encroachments\n             on his person, whether those restrictions or encroachments are\n             directly imposed or indirectly brought about by calculated\n             measures. If so understood, all the acts of surveillance under\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">                                               16</span>\n\f                                                                                           PART D\n\n\n                   <a href=\"/doc/234946/\" id=\"a_45\">Regulation 236</a> infringe the fundamental right of the petitioner under\n                   <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_46\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution.”19      (emphasis supplied)\n\n\n\nSignificantly, both Justice Rajagopala Ayyangar for the majority and Justice Subba\n\nRao in his dissent rely upon the observations of Justice Frankfurter in Wolf v\n\nColorado which specifically advert to privacy. The majority, while relying upon them\n\nto invalidate domiciliary visits at night, regards the sanctity of the home as part of\n\nordered liberty. In the context of other provisions of the regulation, the majority\n\ndeclines to recognise a right of privacy as a constitutional protection. Justice Subba\n\nRao recognised a constitutional by protected right to privacy, considering it as an\n\ningredient of personal liberty.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">D          Gopalan doctrine : fundamental rights as isolated silos\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_24\">19         When eight judges of this Court rendered the decision in M P Sharma in 1954\n\nand later, six judges decided the controversy in Kharak Singh in 1962, the ascendant\n\nand, even well established, doctrine governing the fundamental rights contained in\n\nPart III was founded on the Gopalan principle.

The\n                  majority of the Judges took the view “that “personal liberty” is used\n                  in the article as a compendious term to include within itself all the\n                  varieties of rights which go to make up the “personal liberties” of\n                  man other than those dealt with in the several clauses of <a href=\"/doc/1142233/\" id=\"a_111\">Article\n                  19(1).</a> In other words, while <a href=\"/doc/1142233/\" id=\"a_112\">Article 19(1)</a> deals with particular\n                  species or attributes of that freedom, ‘personal liberty’ in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_113\">Article 21</a>\n                  takes in and comprises the residue. The minority Judges, however,\n                  disagreed with this view taken by the majority and explained their\n                  position in the following words: “No doubt the expression ‘personal\n                  liberty’ is a comprehensive one and the right to move freely is an\n                  attribute of personal liberty. It is said that the freedom to move freely\n                  is carved out of personal liberty and, therefore, the expression\n                  ‘personal liberty’ in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_114\">Article 21</a> excludes that attribute. In our view,\n                  this is not a correct approach. Both are independent fundamental\n                  rights, though there is overlapping. There is no question of one\n                  being carved out of another. The fundamental right of life and\n                  personal liberty has many attributes and some of them are found in\n                  <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_115\">Article 19.</a></span> If a person&#x27;s fundamental right under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_116\">Article 21</a> is\n                  infringed, the State can rely upon a law to sustain the action, but\n                  that cannot be a complete answer unless the said law satisfies the\n                  test <a href=\"/doc/619152/\" id=\"a_117\">laid down in</a> <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_118\">Article 19(2)</a> so far as the attributes covered by\n                  <a href=\"/doc/1142233/\" id=\"a_119\">Article 19(1)</a> are concerned.” There can be no doubt that in view\n                  of the decision of this Court in R.C.

Prior\n\nto the enactment of the <a href=\"/doc/229269/\" id=\"a_123\">Passports Act, 1967</a>, there was no law regulating the right to\n\ntravel abroad as a result of which the order of the Passport Officer refusing a passport\n\nwas held to be invalid.

This view stands abrogated particularly by the judgment in Cooper and the\n\nsubsequent statement of doctrine in Maneka. The decision in Maneka, in fact,\n\nexpressly recognized that it is the dissenting judgment of Justice Subba Rao in\n\nKharak Singh which represents the exposition of the correct constitutional principle.\n\nThe jurisprudential foundation which held the field sixty three years ago in M P\n\nSharma and fifty five years ago in Kharak Singh has given way to what is now a\n\nsettled position in constitutional law. Firstly, the fundamental rights emanate from\n\nbasic notions of liberty and dignity and the enumeration of some facets of liberty as\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_56\">                                           23</span>\n\f                                                                                    PART E\n\n\ndistinctly protected rights under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_129\">Article 19</a> does not denude <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_130\">Article 21</a> of its expansive\n\nambit. Secondly, the validity of a law which infringes the fundamental rights has to be\n\ntested not with reference to the object of state action but on the basis of its effect on\n\nthe guarantees of freedom. Thirdly, the requirement of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_131\">Article 14</a> that state action\n\nmust not be arbitrary and must fulfil the requirement of reasonableness, imparts\n\nmeaning to the constitutional guarantees in Part III.\n\n\n\n25    The doctrinal invalidation of the basic premise underlying the decisions in M P\n\nSharma and Kharak Singh still leaves the issue of whether privacy is a right protected\n\nby Part III of the Constitution open for consideration. There are observations in both\n\ndecisions that the Constitution does not contain a specific protection of the right to\n\nprivacy. Presently, the matter can be looked at from the perspective of what actually\n\nwas the controversy in the two cases. M P Sharma was a case where a law\n\nprescribing a search to obtain documents for investigating into offences was\n\nchallenged as being contrary to the guarantee against self-incrimination in <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_132\">Article\n\n20(3).</a> The Court repelled the argument that a search for documents compelled a\n\nperson accused of an offence to be witness against himself. Unlike a notice to produce\n\ndocuments, which is addressed to a person and whose compliance would constitute\n\na testimonial act, a search warrant and a seizure which follows are not testimonial\n\nacts of a person to whom the warrant is addressed, within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_133\">Article 20(3).</a>\n\nThe Court having held this, the controversy in M P Sharma would rest at that. The\n\nobservations in M P Sharma to the effect that the constitution makers had not thought\n\nit fit to subject the regulatory power of search and seizure to constitutional limitations\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_57\">                                           24</span>\n\f                                                                                      PART E\n\n\nby recognising a fundamental right of privacy (like the US Fourth amendment), and\n\nthat there was no justification to impart it into a ‘totally different fundamental right’ are\n\nat the highest, stray observations.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_35\">\n\n\n26     The decision in M P Sharma held that in the absence of a provision like the\n\nFourth Amendment to the US Constitution, a right to privacy cannot be read into the\n\nIndian Constitution. The decision in M P Sharma did not decide whether a\n\nconstitutional right to privacy is protected by other provisions contained in the\n\nfundamental rights including among them, the right to life and personal liberty under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_134\">Article 21.</a> Hence the decision cannot be construed to specifically exclude the\n\nprotection of privacy under the framework of protected guarantees including those in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_135\">Articles 19</a> or 21. The absence of an express constitutional guarantee of privacy still\n\nbegs the question whether privacy is an element of liberty and, as an integral part of\n\nhuman dignity, is comprehended within the protection of life as well.\n\n\n\n\n27     The decision in Kharak Singh is noteworthy because while invalidating\n\nRegulation 236(b) of the Police Regulations which provided for nightly domiciliary\n\nvisits, the majority construed this to be an unauthorized intrusion into a person’s home\n\nand a violation of ordered liberty. While arriving at this conclusion, the majority\n\nplaced reliance on the privacy doctrine enunciated by Justice Frankfurter, speaking\n\nfor the US Supreme Court in Wolf v Colorado (the extract from Wolf cited in the\n\nmajority judgment specifically adverts to ‘privacy’ twice). Having relied on this doctrine\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_58\">                                             25</span>\n\f                                                                                                    PART F\n\n\nto invalidate domiciliary visits, the majority in Kharak Singh proceeded to repel the\n\nchallenge to other clauses of Regulation 236 on the ground that the right of privacy is\n\nnot guaranteed under the Constitution and hence <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_136\">Article 21</a> had no application. This\n\npart of the judgment in Kharak Singh is inconsistent with the earlier part of the\n\ndecision. The decision of the majority in Kharak Singh suffers from an internal\n\ninconsistency.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_36\">\n\n</p><pre id=\"pre_5\">F       Origins of privacy\n\n28      An evaluation of the origins of privacy is essential in order to understand\n\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_37\">whether (as the Union of India postulates), the concept is so amorphous as to defy\n\ndescription.

Private wrongs are an infringement merely of particular rights\n\nconcerning individuals and are in the nature of civil injuries.

Bell invented the telephone in Boston; the\n                    first commercial telephone exchange opened there in 1877, while\n                    Warren and Brandeis were students at the Harvard Law School. By\n                    1890 there were also telegraphs, fairly inexpensive portable\n                    cameras, sound recording devices, and better and cheaper\n                    methods of making window glass.

Perhaps\n                all of the theories discussed above could be called law of nature or\n                natural law theories. The American tradition, even as early as 1641,\n                ten years before Thomas Hobbes published Leviathan, included\n                claims of natural rights, and these claims appealed to the law of\n                nature, often in terms. Without a moral order of the law of nature\n                sort, natural inalienable rights are difficult to pose. “’It is from natural\n                law, and from it alone, that man obtains those rights we refer to as\n                inalienable and inviolable…Human rights can have no foundation\n                other than natural law.”50\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_57\">46      The idea that individuals can have rights against the State that are prior to rights\n\ncreated by explicit legislation has been developed as part of a liberal theory of law\n\npropounded by Ronald Dworkin. In his seminal work titled “Taking Rights\n\nSeriously”51 (1977), he states that:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_48\">                “Individual rights are political trumps held by individuals.\n                Individuals have rights when, for some reason, a collective goal is\n                not a sufficient justification for denying them what they wish, as\n                individuals, to have or to do, or not a sufficient justification for\n                imposing some loss or injury upon them.”52 (emphasis supplied)\n\n\n\nDworkin asserts the existence of a right against the government as essential to\n\nprotecting the dignity of the individual:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_49\">                “It makes sense to say that a man has a fundamental right\n                against the Government, in the strong sense, like free speech,\n                if that right is necessary to protect his dignity, or his standing\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_95\">50</span>\n   Craig A.

The Court indicated that if the Court does find that a particular right\n\nshould be protected as a fundamental privacy right, it could be overridden only subject\n\nto a compelling interest of the State :\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_59\">                   “There can be no doubt that privacy-dignity claims deserve to be\n                   examined with care and to be denied only when an important\n                   countervailing interest is shown to be superior. If the Court does\n                   find that a claimed right is entitled to protection as a\n                   fundamental privacy right, a law infringing it must satisfy the\n                   compelling State interest test.

In the application of the\n                    Constitution our contemplation cannot only be of what has been but\n                    what may be. Time works changes and brings into existence\n                    new conditions. Subtler and far reaching means of invading\n                    privacy will make it possible to be heard in the street what is\n                    whispered in the closet. Yet, too broad a definition of privacy\n                    raises serious questions about the propriety of judicial\n                    reliance on a right that is not explicit in the Constitution. Of\n                    course, privacy primarily concerns the individual. It therefore\n                    relates to and overlaps with the concept of liberty. The most serious\n                    advocate of privacy must confess that there are serious problems\n                    of defining the essence and scope of the right. Privacy interest in\n                    autonomy must also be placed in the context of other rights and\n                    values.”67 (emphasis supplied)\n\n\nJustice Mathew proceeded to explain what any right of privacy must encompass and\n\nprotect and found it to be implicit in the concept of ordered liberty :\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_61\">                    “Any right to privacy must encompass and protect the personal\n                    intimacies of the home, the family, marriage, motherhood,\n                    procreation and child rearing. This catalogue approach to the\n                    question is obviously not as instructive as it does not give an\n                    analytical picture of the distinctive characteristics of the right of\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_117\">66</span>\n     Ibid, at page 155 (para 22)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_118\">67</span>\n     Ibid, at page 156 (para 23)\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_119\">                                                     43</span>\n\f                                                                                              PART H\n\n\n                    privacy. Perhaps, the only suggestion that can be offered as\n                    unifying principle underlying the concept has been the assertion\n                    that a claimed right must be a fundamental right implicit in the\n                    concept of ordered liberty.”68\n\n\n\nIn adverting to ordered liberty, the judgment is similar to the statement in the judgment\n\nof Justice Rajagopala Ayyangar in Kharak Singh which found the intrusion of the\n\nhome by nightly domiciliary visits a violation of ordered liberty.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_62\">The Court proceeded to hold that in any event, the right to privacy will need a case to\n\ncase elaboration. The following observations were carefully crafted to hold that even\n\non the “assumption” that there is an independent right of privacy emanating from\n\npersonal liberty, the right to movement and free speech, the right is not absolute:\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_63\">                    “The right to privacy in any event will necessarily have to go through\n                    a process of case-by-case development. Therefore, even\n                    assuming that the right to personal liberty, the right to move\n                    freely throughout the territory of India and the freedom of\n                    speech create an independent right of privacy as an emanation\n                    from them which one can characterize as a fundamental right, we\n                    do      not     think     that    the      right     is    absolute.”69\n                    (emphasis supplied)\n\n\nAgain a similar “assumption” was made by the Court in the following observations:\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_64\">                    “…Assuming that the fundamental rights explicitly guaranteed to a\n                    citizen have penumbral zones and that the right to privacy is itself a\n                    fundamental right, that fundamental right must be subject to\n                    restriction on the basis of compelling public interest. As Regulation\n                    856 has the force of law, it cannot be said that the fundamental right\n                    of the petitioner under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_141\">Article 21</a> has been violated by the provisions\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_120\">68</span>\n     Ibid, at page 156 (para 24)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_121\">69</span>\n     Ibid, at page 157 (para 28)\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_122\">                                                      44</span>\n\f                                                                                             PART H\n\n\n                   contained in it : for, what is guaranteed under that Article is that no\n                   person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except by the\n                   procedure established by ‘law’. We think that the procedure is\n                   reasonable having regard to the provisions of Regulations 853 (c)\n                   and 857.”70 (emphasis supplied)\n\n\n\nThe Court declined to interfere with the regulations.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_65\">50         The judgment in Gobind does not contain a clear statement of principle by the\n\nCourt of the existence of an independent right of privacy or of such a right being an\n\nemanation from explicit constitutional guarantees. The Bench, which consisted of\n\nthree judges, may have been constrained by the dictum in the latter part of Kharak\n\nSingh. Whatever be the reason, it is evident that in several places Justice Mathew\n\nproceeded on the “assumption” that if the right to privacy is protected under the\n\nConstitution, it is a part of ordered liberty and is not absolute but subject to restrictions\n\ntailor-made to fulfil a compelling state interest. This analysis of the decision in Gobind\n\nassumes significance because subsequent decisions of smaller Benches have\n\nproceeded on the basis that Gobind does indeed recognise a right to privacy. What\n\nthe contours of such a right are, emerges from a reading of those decisions. This is\n\nthe next aspect to which we now turn.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_66\">51         Malak Singh v State of Punjab and Haryana71 (“Malak Singh”) dealt with the\n\nprovisions of <a href=\"/doc/1603302/\" id=\"a_142\">Section 23</a> of the Punjab Police Rules under which a surveillance register\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_123\">70</span>\n     Ibid, at page 157-158 (para 31)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_124\">71</span>\n     (1981) 1 SCC 420\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_125\">                                                     45</span>\n\f                                                                                      PART H\n\n\nwas to be maintained among other persons, of all convicts of a particular description\n\nand persons who were reasonably believed to be habitual offenders whether or not,\n\nthey were convicted. The validity of the rules was not questioned in view of the\n\ndecisions in Kharak Singh and Gobind.               The rules provided for modalities of\n\nsurveillance. Justice O Chinnappa Reddy speaking for a Bench of two judges of this\n\nCourt recognised the need for surveillance on habitual and potential offenders. In his\n\nview:\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_67\">             “Prevention of crime is one of the prime purposes of the constitution\n             of a police force. The preamble to the <a href=\"/doc/1612841/\" id=\"a_143\">Police Act, 1861</a> says:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_68\">             “Whereas it is expedient to reorganise the police and to make it a\n             more efficient instrument for the prevention and detection of crime.”\n             <a href=\"/doc/1481639/\" id=\"a_144\">Section 23</a> of the Police Act prescribes it as the duty of police\n             officers “to collect and communicate intelligence affecting the public\n             peace; to prevent the commission of offences and public\n             nuisances”. In connection with these duties it will be necessary to\n             keep discreet surveillance over reputed bad characters, habitual\n             offenders and other potential offenders. Organised crime cannot be\n             successfully fought without close watch of suspects. But,\n             surveillance may be intrusive and it may so seriously encroach\n             on the privacy of a citizen as to infringe his fundamental right\n             to personal liberty guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_145\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution\n             and the freedom of movement guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1024002/\" id=\"a_146\">Article 19(1)(d).</a> That\n             cannot be permitted. This is recognised by the Punjab Police Rules\n             themselves. Rule 23.7, which prescribes the mode of surveillance,\n             permits the close watch over the movements of the person under\n             surveillance but without any illegal interference. Permissible\n             surveillance is only to the extent of a close watch over the\n             movements of the person under surveillance and no more. So long\n             as surveillance is for the purpose of preventing crime and is\n             confined to the limits prescribed by Rule 23.7 we do not think a\n             person whose name is included in the surveillance register can\n             have a genuine cause for complaint. We may notice here that\n             interference in accordance with law and for the prevention of\n             disorder and crime is an exception recognised even by European\n             Convention of Human Rights to the right to respect for a person&#x27;s\n             private and family life. <a href=\"/doc/691208/\" id=\"a_147\">Article 8</a> of the Convention reads as follows:\n</blockquote>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_126\">                                              46</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_69\">\f                                                                                           PART H\n\n\n                        “(1) Everyone&#x27;s right to respect for his private and\n                        family life, his home and his correspondence shall be\n                        recognised.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_70\">                        (2) There shall be no interference by a public authority\n                        with the exercise of this right, except such as is in\n                        accordance with law and is necessary in a democratic\n                        society in the interests of national security, public\n                        safety, for the prevention of disorder and crime or for\n                        the protection of health or morals.””72      (emphasis\n                        supplied)\n\n\n\nThe Court did not consider it unlawful for the police to conduct surveillance so long as\n\nit was for the purpose of preventing crime and was confined to the limits prescribed\n\nby Rule 23.7 which, while authorising a close watch on the movement of a person\n\nunder surveillance, contained a condition that this should be without any illegal\n\ninterference. The object being to prevent crime, the Court held that the person who\n\nis subject to surveillance is not entitled to access the register nor was a pre-decisional\n\nhearing compliant with natural justice warranted. Confidentiality, this Court held, was\n\nrequired in the interest of the public, including keeping in confidence the sources of\n\ninformation. Again the Court held:\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_71\">                   “But all this does not mean that the police have a licence to enter\n                   the names of whoever they like (dislike?) in the surveillance\n                   register; nor can the surveillance be such as to squeeze the\n                   fundamental freedoms guaranteed to all citizens or to obstruct the\n                   free exercise and enjoyment of those freedoms; nor can the\n                   surveillance so intrude as to offend the dignity of the individual.\n                   Surveillance of persons who do not fall within the categories\n                   mentioned in Rule 23.4 or for reasons unconnected with the\n                   prevention of crime, or excessive surveillance falling beyond the\n                   limits prescribed by the rules, will entitle a citizen to the court&#x27;s\n                   protection which the court will not hesitate to give.

The note following Rule 23.4 is instructive. It enjoins a duty\n                    upon the police officer to construe the rule strictly and confine the\n                    entries in the surveillance register to the class of persons mentioned\n                    in the rule. Similarly Rule 23.7 demands that there should be no\n                    illegal interference in the guise of surveillance. Surveillance,\n                    therefore, has to be unobtrusive and within bounds.”73\n\n\n\nThe observations in Malak Singh on the issue of privacy indicate that an\n\nencroachment on privacy infringes personal liberty under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_148\">Article 21</a> and the right to\n\nthe freedom of movement under <a href=\"/doc/1024002/\" id=\"a_149\">Article 19(1)(d).</a> Without specifically holding that\n\nprivacy is a protected constitutional value under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_150\">Article 19</a> or <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_151\">Article 21</a>, the judgment\n\nof this Court indicates that serious encroachments on privacy impinge upon personal\n\nliberty and the freedom of movement. The Court linked such an encroachment with\n\nthe dignity of the individual which would be offended by surveillance bereft of\n\nprocedural protections and carried out in a manner that would obstruct the free\n\nexercise of freedoms guaranteed by the fundamental rights.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_72\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"524900\" id=\"span_129\">52         <a href=\"/doc/524900/\" id=\"a_152\">State of Maharashtra v Madhukar Narayan Mardikar74</a> is another decision by\n\na two-judge Bench which dealt with a case of a police inspector who was alleged to\n\nhave attempted to have non-consensual intercourse with a woman by entering the\n\nhutment where she lived.

The High Court quashed the punishment both on the ground of\n\na violation of the principles of natural justice, and by questioning the character of the\n\nvictim. Holding that this approach of the High Court was misconceived, Justice A M\n\nAhmadi (as the learned Chief Justice then was) held that though the victim had\n\nadmitted “the dark side of her life”, she was yet entitled to her privacy :</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_73\">                    “The High Court observes that since Banubi is an unchaste woman\n                    it would be extremely unsafe to allow the fortune and career of a\n                    government official to be put in jeopardy upon the uncorroborated\n                    version of such a woman who makes no secret of her illicit intimacy\n                    with another person. She was honest enough to admit the dark side\n                    of her life. Even a woman of easy virtue is entitled to privacy\n                    and no one can invade her privacy as and when he likes. So\n                    also it is not open to any and every person to violate her\n                    person as and when he wishes. She is entitled to protect her\n                    person if there is an attempt to violate it against her wish. She\n                    is equally entitled to the protection of law. Therefore, merely\n                    because she is a woman of easy virtue, her evidence cannot\n                    be thrown overboard. At the most the officer called upon to\n                    evaluate her evidence would be required to administer caution unto\n                    himself before accepting her evidence.”75 (emphasis supplied)\n\n\n\nAs the above extract indicates, the issue before this Court was essentially based on\n\nthe appreciation of the evidence of the victim by the High Court.

A citizen has a right to safeguard the privacy of his\nhome, his family, marriage, procreation, motherhood, child-bearing\nand education among other matters. None can publish anything\nconcerning the above matters without his consent — whether\ntruthful or otherwise and whether laudatory or critical. If he does so,\nhe would be violating the right to privacy of the person concerned\nand would be liable in an action for damages. Position may,\nhowever, be different, if a person voluntarily thrusts himself into\ncontroversy or voluntarily invites or raises a controversy.\n(2) The rule aforesaid is subject to the exception, that any\npublication concerning the aforesaid aspects becomes\nunobjectionable if such publication is based upon public records\nincluding court records. This is for the reason that once a matter\nbecomes a matter of public record, the right to privacy no longer\nsubsists and it becomes a legitimate subject for comment by press\nand media among others. We are, however, of the opinion that in\nthe interests of decency [<a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_158\">Article 19(2)]</a> an exception must be carved\nout to this rule, viz., a female who is the victim of a sexual assault,\nkidnap, abduction or a like offence should not further be subjected\nto the indignity of her name and the incident being publicised in\npress/media.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_81\">(3) There is yet another exception to the rule in (1) above — indeed,\nthis is not an exception but an independent rule. In the case of\npublic officials, it is obvious, right to privacy, or for that matter, the\nremedy of action for damages is simply not available with respect\nto their acts and conduct relevant to the discharge of their official\nduties. This is so even where the publication is based upon facts\nand statements which are not true, unless the official establishes\nthat the publication was made (by the defendant) with reckless\ndisregard for truth. In such a case, it would be enough for the\ndefendant (member of the press or media) to prove that he acted\nafter a reasonable verification of the facts; it is not necessary for\nhim to prove that what he has written is true.

Hence the decision has been criticized on the ground that\n\nRajagopal was about an action between private parties and, therefore, ought to have\n\ndealt with privacy in the context of tort law. 83 While it is true that in Rajagopal it is a\n\nprivate publisher who was seeking to publish an article about a death row convict, it\n\nis equally true that the Court dealt with a prior restraint on publication imposed by the\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_145\">81</span>\n   Ibid, at pages 649-650 (para 26)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_146\">82</span>\n   Gautam Bhatia, “State Surveillance and the Right to Privacy in India: A Constitutional Biography”, National\n   Law School of India Review (2014), Vol. 26(2), at pages 138-139\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_147\">83</span>\n   Ibid\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_148\">                                                     53</span>\n\f                                                                                          PART H\n\n\nstate and its prison officials.

But the right to hold a telephone conversation in the privacy\n                    of one&#x27;s home or office without interference can certainly be claimed\n                    as “right to privacy”. Conversations on the telephone are often of an\n                    intimate and confidential character. Telephone conversation is a\n                    part of modern man&#x27;s life.

The expression “by\n\nitself” may indicate one of two meanings. The first is that the Constitution does not\n\nrecognise a standalone right to privacy. The second recognizes that there is no\n\nexpress delineation of such a right. Evidently, the Court left the evolution of the\n\ncontours of the right to a case by case determination. Telephone conversations from\n\nthe home or office were construed to be an integral element of the privacy of an\n\nindividual. In PUCL, the Court consciously established the linkages between various\n\narticles conferring guarantees of fundamental rights when it noted that wire-tapping\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_165\">                                           59</span>\n\f                                                                                    PART H\n\n\ninfringes privacy and in consequence the right to life and personal liberty under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_192\">Article\n\n21</a> and the freedom of speech and expression under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_193\">Article 19(1)(a).</a> The need to\n\nread the fundamental constitutional guarantees with a purpose illuminated by India’s\n\ncommitment to the international regime of human rights’ protection also weighed in\n\nthe decision. <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_194\">Section 5(2)</a> of the Telegraph Act was to be regulated by rules framed\n\nby the Government to render the modalities of telephone tapping fair, just and\n\nreasonable under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_195\">Article 21.</a> The importance which the Court ascribes to privacy is\n\nevident from the fact that it did not await the eventual formulation of rules by\n\nParliament and prescribed that in the meantime, certain procedural safeguards which\n\nit envisaged should be put into place.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_95\">62       While dealing with a case involving the rape of an eight year old child, a three-\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_62\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"635584\" id=\"span_166\">judge Bench of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/635584/\" id=\"a_196\">State of Karnataka v Krishnappa91</a> held:</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_96\">                 <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"76278\" id=\"span_167\">“Sexual violence apart from being… dehumanising… is an unlawful\n                 intrusion of the right to privacy and sanctity… It… offends her…\n                 dignity.”92\n\n\n\nSimilar observations were made in <a href=\"/doc/76278/\" id=\"a_197\">Sudhansu Sekhar Sahoo v State of Orissa93</a>.</span>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_97\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"160470236\" id=\"span_168\">63       In <a href=\"/doc/160470236/\" id=\"a_198\">Sharda v Dharmpal94</a>, the appellant and respondent were spouses.

Justice S B Sinha,\n\nspeaking for the Bench of three judges, dealt with the first aspect of the matter\n\n(whether a matrimonial Court has jurisdiction to order a medical examination) in the\n\nfollowing terms:</span>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_98\">                    “Even otherwise the court may issue an appropriate direction so as\n                    to satisfy itself as to whether apart from treatment he requires\n                    adequate protection inter alia by way of legal aid so that he may not\n                    be subject to an unjust order because of his incapacity. Keeping in\n                    view of the fact that in a case of mental illness the court has\n                    adequate power to examine the party or get him examined by a\n                    qualified doctor, we are of the opinion that in an appropriate case\n                    the court may take recourse to such a procedure even at the\n                    instance of the party to the lis95…\n                    Furthermore, the court must be held to have the requisite power\n                    even under <a href=\"/doc/56600062/\" id=\"a_200\">Section 151</a> of the Code of Civil Procedure to issue\n                    such direction either suo motu or otherwise which, according to him,\n                    would lead to the truth.96”\n\n\n64         The second question considered by the Court was whether a compulsive\n\nsubjecting of a person to a medical examination violates <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_201\">Article 21.</a> After noticing the\n\nobservations in M P Sharma and Kharak Singh where it was held that the\n\nConstitution has not guaranteed the right of privacy, the Court held that in subsequent\n\ndecisions, such a right has been read into <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_202\">Article 21</a> on an expansive interpretation of\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_174\">95</span>\n     Ibid, at page 513 (para 52)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_175\">96</span>\n     Ibid, at page 513 (para 53)\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_176\">                                                     61</span>\n\f                                                                                              PART H\n\n\npersonal liberty. In the course of its judgment, the Court adverted to the decisions in\n\nRajagopal, PUCL, Gobind and Mr X v Hospital Z on the basis of which it stated that\n\nit had “outlined the law relating to privacy in India”. In the view of this Court, in\n\nmatrimonial cases where a decree of divorce is sought on medical grounds, a medical\n\nexamination is the only way in which an allegation could be proved.

Once that is so, then unless there is some probable or\n                   reasonable cause or reasonable basis or material before the\n                   Collector for reaching an opinion that the documents in the\n                   possession of the bank tend to secure any duty or to prove or to\n                   lead to the discovery of any fraud or omission in relation to any duty,\n                   the search or taking notes or extracts therefore, cannot be valid.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_65\">                   The above safeguards must necessarily be read into the provision\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_187\">103</span>\n      Supra Note 95, at page 516 (para 36)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_188\">104</span>\n      Ibid, at page 518 (para 39)\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_189\">                                                     64</span>\n\f                                                                                             PART H\n\n\n                    relating to search and inspection and seizure so as to save it from\n                    any unconstitutionality.”105\n\n\nHence the Court repudiated the notion that a person who places documents with a\n\nbank would, as a result, forsake an expectation of confidentiality. In the view of the\n\nCourt, even if the documents cease to be at a place other than in the custody and\n\ncontrol of the customer, privacy attaches to persons and not places and hence the\n\nprotection of privacy is not diluted. Moreover, in the view of the Court, there has to be\n\na reasonable basis or material for the Collector to form an opinion that the documents\n\nin the possession of the bank would secure the purpose of investigating into an act of\n\nfraud or an omission in relation to duty. The safeguards which the Court introduced\n\nwere regarded as being implicit in the need to make a search of this nature\n\nreasonable. The second part of the ruling of the Court is equally important for it finds\n\nfault with a statutory provision which allows an excessive delegation of the power\n\nconferred upon the Collector to inspect documents. The provision, the Court rules,\n\nwould allow the customers’ privacy to be breached by non-governmental persons.\n\nHence the statute, insofar as it allowed the Collector to authorize any person to seek\n\ninspection, would be unenforceable.

The State must clearly define\n                    the officers by designation or state that the power can be delegated\n                    to officers not below a particular rank in the official hierarchy, as\n                    may be designated by the State.”106\n\n\n66         The significance of the judgment in Canara Bank lies first in its reaffirmation of\n\nthe right to privacy as emanating from the liberties guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_219\">Article 19</a> and from\n\nthe protection of life and personal liberty under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_220\">Article 21.</a> Secondly, the Court finds\n\nthe foundation for the reaffirmation of this right not only in the judgments in Kharak\n\nSingh and Gobind and the cases which followed, but also in terms of India’s\n\ninternational commitments under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR)\n\nand International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). Thirdly, the right to\n\nprivacy is construed as a right which attaches to the person. The significance of this\n\nis that the right to privacy is not lost as a result of confidential documents or information\n\nbeing parted with by the customer to the custody of the bank. Fourthly, the Court\n\nemphasised the need to read procedural safeguards to ensure that the power of\n\nsearch and seizure of the nature contemplated by Section 73 is not exercised\n\narbitrarily. Fifthly, access to bank records to the Collector does not permit a delegation\n\nof those powers by the Collector to a private individual.

Suchita\n\nSrivastava v Chandigarh Administration119 (“Suchita Srivastava”) arose in the\n\ncontext of the <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_236\">Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act (MTP) Act, 1971</a>. A woman who\n\nwas alleged to have been raped while residing in a welfare institution run by the\n\ngovernment was pregnant. The district administration moved the High Court to seek\n\ntermination of the pregnancy. The High Court directed that the pregnancy be\n\nterminated though medical experts had opined that the victim had expressed her\n\nwillingness to bear the child. The High Court had issued this direction without the\n\nconsent of the woman which was mandated under the statute where the woman is a\n\nmajor and does not suffer from a mental illness. The woman in this case was found to\n\nsuffer from a case of mild to moderate mental retardation. Speaking for a Bench of\n\nthree judges, Chief Justice Balakrishnan held that the reproductive choice of the\n\nwoman should be respected having regard to the mandate of <a href=\"/doc/830756/\" id=\"a_237\">Section 3</a>. In the view\n\nof the Court:\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_115\">                  “There is no doubt that a woman&#x27;s right to make reproductive\n                  choices is also a dimension of “personal liberty” as understood\n                  under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_238\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India. It is important to\n                  recognise that reproductive choices can be exercised to procreate\n                  as well as to abstain from procreating. The crucial consideration\n                  is that a woman&#x27;s right to privacy, dignity and bodily integrity\n                  should be respected. This means that there should be no\n                  restriction whatsoever on the exercise of reproductive choices such\n                  as a woman&#x27;s right to refuse participation in sexual activity or\n                  alternatively the insistence on use of contraceptive methods.\n                  Furthermore, women are also free to choose birth control methods\n                  such as undergoing sterilisation procedures.

However, in the case of pregnant\n                    women there is also a “compelling State interest” in protecting the\n                    life of the prospective child. Therefore, the termination of a\n                    pregnancy is only permitted when the conditions specified in the\n                    applicable statute have been fulfilled. Hence, the provisions of the\n                    <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_239\">MTP Act, 1971</a> can also be viewed as reasonable restrictions that\n                    have been placed on the exercise of reproductive choices.” 120\n                                                                  (emphasis supplied)\n\n\n\nThe Court noted that the statute requires the consent of a guardian where the woman\n\nhas not attained majority or is mentally ill.

An individual&#x27;s\n                   decision to make a statement is the product of a private choice and\n                   there should be no scope for any other individual to interfere with\n                   such autonomy, especially in circumstances where the person\n                   faces exposure to criminal charges or penalties…\n\n                   Therefore, it is our considered opinion that subjecting a person to\n                   the impugned techniques in an involuntary manner violates the\n                   prescribed boundaries of privacy.

The content of the constitutional right to privacy and its\n\nlimitations have proceeded on a case to case basis, each precedent seeking to build\n\nupon and follow the previous formulations. The doctrinal foundation essentially rests\n\nupon the trilogy of M P Sharma – Kharak Singh – Gobind upon which subsequent\n\ndecisions including those in Rajagopal, PUCL, Canara Bank, Selvi and NALSA have\n\ncontributed. Reconsideration of the doctrinal basis cannot be complete without\n\nevaluating what the trilogy of cases has decided.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_91\">\n\n\n88         M P Sharma dealt with a challenge to a search on the ground that the statutory\n\nprovision which authorized it, violated the guarantee against self-incrimination in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_321\">Article 20(3).</a> In the absence of a specific provision like the Fourth Amendment to the\n\nUS Constitution in the Indian Constitution, the Court answered the challenge by its\n\nruling that an individual who is subject to a search during the course of which material\n\nis seized does not make a voluntary testimonial statement of the nature that would\n\nattract <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_322\">Article 20(3).</a> The Court distinguished a compulsory search from a voluntary\n\nstatement of disclosure in pursuance of a notice issued by an authority to produce\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_287\">152</span>\n      Ibid, at page 676 (para 953)\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_288\">                                                  87</span>\n\f                                                                                     PART H\n\n\ndocuments. It was the former category that was held to be involved in a compulsive\n\nsearch, which the Court held would not attract the guarantee against self-\n\nincrimination. The judgment, however, proceeded further to hold that in the absence\n\nof the right to privacy having been enumerated in the Constitution, a provision like the\n\nFourth Amendment to the US Constitution could not be read into our own. The\n\nobservation in regard to the absence of the right to privacy in our Constitution was\n\nstrictly speaking, not necessary for the decision of the Court in M P Sharma and the\n\nobservation itself is no more than a passing observation. Moreover, the decision does\n\nnot adjudicate upon whether privacy could be a constitutionally protected right under\n\nany other provision such as <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_323\">Article 21</a> or under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_324\">Article 19.</a>\n\n\n\n\n89     Kharak Singh does not contain a reference to M P Sharma. The decision of\n\nthe majority in Kharak Singh is essentially divided into two parts; the first dealing with\n\nthe validity of a regulation for nocturnal domiciliary visits (which was struck down) and\n\nthe second dealing with the rest of the regulation (which was upheld). The decision\n\non the first part, which dealt with Regulation 236(b) conveys an inescapable\n\nimpression that the regulation invaded the sanctity of the home and was a violation of\n\nordered liberty. Though the reasoning of the Court does not use the expression\n\n‘privacy’, it alludes to the decision of the US Supreme Court in Wolf v Colorado, which\n\ndeals with privacy. Besides, the portion extracted in the judgment has a reference to\n\nprivacy specifically at two places. While holding domiciliary visits at night to be invalid,\n\nthe Court drew sustenance from the right to life under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_325\">Article 21</a> which means\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_289\">                                            88</span>\n\f                                                                                       PART H\n\n\nsomething more than a mere animal existence. The right under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_326\">Article 21</a> includes the\n\nenjoyment of those faculties which render the right meaningful. Hence, the first part\n\nof the decision in Kharak Singh represents an amalgam of life, personal liberty and\n\nprivacy. It protects interests which are grounded in privacy under the rubric of liberty.\n\nThe difficulty in construing the decision arises because in the second part of its\n\ndecision, the majority upheld the rest of the regulation and observed (while doing so)\n\nthat there is an absence of a protected right to privacy under the Constitution. These\n\nobservations in the second part are at variance with those dealing with the first. The\n\nview about the absence of a right to privacy is an isolated observation which cannot\n\ncoexist with the essential determination rendered on the first aspect of the regulation.\n\nSubsequent Benches of this Court in the last five decades and more, have attempted\n\nto make coherent doctrine out of the uneasy coexistence between the first and the\n\nsecond parts of the decision in Kharak Singh. Several of them rely on the protection\n\nof interests grounded in privacy in the first part, under the conceptual foundation of\n\nordered liberty.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_92\">\n\n\n90     Gobind proceeded on the basis of an assumption and explains what according\n\nto the Court would be the content of the right to privacy if it is held to be a constitutional\n\nright. Gobind underlines that the right would be intrinsic to ordered liberty and would\n\ncover intimate matters such as family, marriage and procreation. Gobind, while\n\nrecognizing that the right would not be absolute and would be subject to the regulatory\n\npower of the State, conditioned the latter on the existence of a compelling state\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_290\">                                             89</span>\n\f                                                                                   PART H\n\n\ninterest. The decision also brings in the requirement of a narrow tailoring of the\n\nregulation to meet the needs of a compelling interest. The Bench which decided\n\nGobind adverted to the decision in Kharak Singh (though not M P Sharma). Be that\n\nas it may, Gobind has proceeded on the basis of an assumption that the right to\n\nprivacy is a constitutionally protected right in India. Subsequent decisions of this Court\n\nhave treated the formulation of a right to privacy as one that emerges out of Kharak\n\nSingh or Gobind (or both). Evidently, it is the first part of the decision in Kharak\n\nSingh which is construed as having recognized a constitutional entitlement to privacy\n\nwithout reconciling the second part which contains a specific observation on the\n\nabsence of a protected constitutional right to privacy in the Constitution. Succeeding\n\nBenches of smaller strength were not obviously in a position to determine the\n\ncorrectness of the M P Sharma and Kharak Singh formulations. They had to weave\n\na jurisprudence of privacy as new challenges emerged from a variety of sources: wire-\n\ntapping, narco-analysis, gender based identity, medical information, informational\n\nautonomy and other manifestations of privacy. As far as the decisions following upon\n\nGobind are concerned, it does emerge that the assumptions which find specific\n\nmention in several parts of the decision were perhaps not adequately placed in\n\nperspective. Gobind has been construed by subsequent Benches as affirming the\n\nright to privacy.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_93\">\n\n\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"382721\" id=\"span_291\">91     The right to privacy has been traced in the decisions which have been rendered\n\nover more than four decades to the guarantee of life and personal liberty in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_327\">Article 21</a>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_292\">                                           90</span>\n\f                                                                                              PART H\n\n\nand the freedoms set out in <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_328\">Article 19.</a> In addition, India’s commitment to a world order\n\nfounded on respect for human rights has been noticed along with the specific articles\n\nof the UDHR and the ICCPR which embody the right to privacy. 153 In the view of this\n\nCourt, international law has to be construed as a part of domestic law in the absence\n\nof legislation to the contrary and, perhaps more significantly, the meaning of\n\nconstitutional guarantees must be illuminated by the content of international\n\nconventions to which India is a party. Consequently, as new cases brought new issues\n\nand problems before the Court, the content of the right to privacy has found\n\nelaboration in these diverse contexts. These would include telephone tapping (PUCL),\n\nprior restraints on publication of material on a death row convict (Rajagopal),\n\ninspection and search of confidential documents involving the banker - customer\n\nrelationship (Canara Bank), disclosure of HIV status (<a href=\"/doc/382721/\" id=\"a_329\">Mr X v Hospital Z</a>), food\n\npreferences and animal slaughter (Hinsa Virodhak Sangh), medical termination of\n\npregnancy (Suchita Srivastava), scientific tests in criminal investigation (Selvi),\n\ndisclosure of bank accounts held overseas (Ram Jethmalani) and the right of\n\ntransgenders (NALSA). Early cases dealt with police regulations authorising\n\nintrusions on liberty, such as surveillance. As Indian society has evolved, the assertion\n\nof the right to privacy has been considered by this Court in varying contexts replicating\n\nthe choices and autonomy of the individual citizen.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_293\">153</span>\n  See Rishika Taneja and Sidhant Kumar, Privacy Law: Principles, Injunctions and Compensation, Eastern\nBook Company (2014), for a comprehensive account on the right to privacy and privacy laws in India.\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_294\">                                                 91</span>\n\f                                                                                       PART I\n\n\n92        The deficiency, however, is in regard to a doctrinal formulation of the basis on\n\nwhich it can be determined as to whether the right to privacy is constitutionally\n\nprotected. M P Sharma need not have answered the question; Kharak Singh dealt\n\nwith it in a somewhat inconsistent formulation while Gobind rested on assumption. M\n\nP Sharma being a decision of eight judges, this Bench has been called upon to decide\n\non the objection of the Union of India to the existence of such a right in the first place.</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><pre id=\"pre_8\">I         The Indian Constitution\n\n\n          Preamble\n\n\n93        The Preamble to the Constitution postulates that the people of India have\n\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_94\">resolved to constitute India into a Republic which (among other things) is Sovereign\n\nand Democratic and to secure to all its citizens:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_132\">                  “JUSTICE, social, economic and political;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_133\">                  LIBERTY of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship;\n                  EQUALITY of status and of opportunity; and to promote among\n                  them all\n                  FRATERNITY assuring the dignity of the individual and the unity of\n                  the Nation;…”\n\n\n\n94        In Sajjan Singh v State of Rajasthan154, Justice Mudholkar alluded to the fact\n\nthat the Preamble to our Constitution is “not of the common run” as is the Preamble\n\nin a legislative enactment but was marked both by a “stamp of deep deliberation” and\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_295\">154</span>\n      (1965) 1 SCR 933\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_296\">                                                 92</span>\n\f                                                                                     PART I\n\n\nprecision.

Nor\n                   has the Parliament the power to revoke the mandate to build a\n                   welfare State and egalitarian society. These limitations are only\n                   illustrative and not exhaustive. Despite these limitations, however,\n                   there can be no question that the amending power is a wide power\n                   and it reaches every Article and every part of the Constitution. That\n                   power can be used to reshape the Constitution to fulfil the obligation\n                   imposed on the State. It can also be used to reshape the\n                   Constitution within the limits mentioned earlier, to make it an\n                   effective instrument for social good. We are unable to agree with\n                   the contention that in order to build a welfare State, it is\n                   necessary to destroy some of the human freedoms. That, at\n                   any rate is not the perspective of our Constitution. Our\n                   Constitution envisages that the State should without delay\n                   make available to all the citizens of this country the real\n                   benefits of those freedoms in a democratic way. Human\n                   freedoms are lost gradually and imperceptibly and their destruction\n                   is generally followed by authoritarian rule. That is what history has\n                   taught us. Struggle between liberty and power is eternal. Vigilance\n                   is the price that we like every other democratic society have to pay\n                   to safeguard the democratic values enshrined in our Constitution.\n                   Even the best of Governments are not averse to have more and\n                   more power to carry out their plans and programmes which they\n                   may sincerely believe to be in public interest. But a freedom once\n                   lost is hardly ever regained except by revolution.

The argument assumes that the right to privacy\n\nis independent of the liberties guaranteed by Part III of the Constitution. There lies\n\nthe error. The right to privacy is an element of human dignity. The sanctity of privacy\n\nlies in its functional relationship with dignity. Privacy ensures that a human being can\n\nlead a life of dignity by securing the inner recesses of the human personality from\n\nunwanted intrusion. Privacy recognises the autonomy of the individual and the right\n\nof every person to make essential choices which affect the course of life.

No one escapes entirely. Some yield blindly, some\n                   with sophistication. Only a few more or less effectively resist. I have\n                   always leaned in favour of upholding personal liberty, for, I believe,\n                   it is one of the most cherished values of mankind. Without it life\n                   would not be worth living. It is one of the pillars of free democratic\n                   society. Men have readily laid down their lives at its altar, in order\n                   to secure it, protect it and preserve it. But I do not think it would be\n                   right for me to allow my love of personal liberty to cloud my vision\n                   or to persuade me to place on the relevant provision of the\n                   Constitution a construction which its language cannot reasonably\n                   bear. I cannot assume to myself the role of Plato&#x27;s “Philosopher\n                   King” in order to render what I consider ideal justice between the\n                   citizen and the State. After all, the Constitution is the law of all laws\n                   and there alone judicial conscience must find its ultimate support\n                   and its final resting place. It is in this spirit of humility and obedience\n                   to the Constitution and driven by judicial compulsion, that I have\n                   come to the conclusion that the Presidential Order dated June 27,\n                   1975 bars maintainability of a writ petition for habeas corpus where\n                   an order of detention is challenged on the ground that it is mala fide\n                   or not under the Act or not in compliance with it.”205\n\n\n\nIn his dissenting opinion, Justice Khanna emphatically held that the suspension of the\n\nright to move any Court for the enforcement of the right under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_388\">Article 21</a>, upon a\n\nproclamation of emergency, would not affect the enforcement of the basic right to life\n\nand liberty.

The right to\n                   life and personal liberty is the most precious right of human beings\n                   in civilised societies governed by the rule of law.

The human element in the life of the\n\nindividual is integrally founded on the sanctity of life. Dignity is associated with liberty\n\nand freedom. No civilized state can contemplate an encroachment upon life and\n\npersonal liberty without the authority of law. Neither life nor liberty are bounties\n\nconferred by the state nor does the Constitution create these rights. The right to life\n\nhas existed even before the advent of the Constitution. In recognising the right, the\n\nConstitution does not become the sole repository of the right.

Justice Khanna was clearly right in holding that the recognition of\n\nthe right to life and personal liberty under the Constitution does not denude the\n\nexistence of that right, apart from it nor can there be a fatuous assumption that in\n\nadopting the Constitution the people of India surrendered the most precious aspect of\n\nthe human persona, namely, life, liberty and freedom to the state on whose mercy\n\nthese rights would depend. Such a construct is contrary to the basic foundation of the\n\nrule of law which imposes restraints upon the powers vested in the modern state when\n\nit deals with the liberties of the individual.

That\n\n“a miniscule fraction of the country’s population constitutes lesbians, gays, bisexuals\n\nor transgenders” (as observed in the judgment of this Court) is not a sustainable basis\n\nto deny the right to privacy. The purpose of elevating certain rights to the stature of\n\nguaranteed fundamental rights is to insulate their exercise from the disdain of\n\nmajorities, whether legislative or popular. The guarantee of constitutional rights does\n\nnot depend upon their exercise being favourably regarded by majoritarian opinion.\n\nThe test of popular acceptance does not furnish a valid basis to disregard rights which\n\nare conferred with the sanctity of constitutional protection.

Yet in a democratic\n\nConstitution founded on the rule of law, their rights are as sacred as those conferred\n\non other citizens to protect their freedoms and liberties. Sexual orientation is an\n\nessential attribute of privacy. Discrimination against an individual on the basis of\n\nsexual orientation is deeply offensive to the dignity and self-worth of the individual.\n\nEquality demands that the sexual orientation of each individual in society must be\n\nprotected on an even platform. The right to privacy and the protection of sexual\n\norientation lie at the core of the fundamental rights guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_422\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_423\">, 15</a> and\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_424\">21</a> of the Constitution.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_126\">\n\n\n127   The view in Koushal that the High Court had erroneously relied upon\n\ninternational precedents “in its anxiety to protect the so-called rights of LGBT.\n\npersons” is similarly, in our view, unsustainable. The rights of the lesbian, gay,\n\nbisexual and transgender population cannot be construed to be “so-called rights”. The\n\nexpression “so-called” seems to suggest the exercise of a liberty in the garb of a right\n\nwhich is illusory. This is an inappropriate construction of the privacy based claims of\n\nthe LGBT population. Their rights are not “so-called” but are real rights founded on\n\nsound constitutional doctrine. They inhere in the right to life. They dwell in privacy and\n\ndignity. They constitute the essence of liberty and freedom. Sexual orientation is an\n\nessential component of identity. Equal protection demands protection of the identity\n\nof every individual without discrimination.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_127\">\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_415\">                                           124</span>\n\f                                                                                  PART I\n\n\n128   The decision in Koushal presents a de minimis rationale when it asserts that\n\nthere have been only two hundred prosecutions for violating Section 377. The de\n\nminimis hypothesis is misplaced because the invasion of a fundamental right is not\n\nrendered tolerable when a few, as opposed to a large number of persons, are\n\nsubjected to hostile treatment. The reason why such acts of hostile discrimination are\n\nconstitutionally impermissible is because of the chilling effect which they have on the\n\nexercise of the fundamental right in the first place. For instance, pre-publication\n\nrestraints such as censorship are vulnerable because they discourage people from\n\nexercising their right to free speech because of the fear of a restraint coming into\n\noperation. The chilling effect on the exercise of the right poses a grave danger to the\n\nunhindered fulfilment of one’s sexual orientation, as an element of privacy and dignity.\n\nThe chilling effect is due to the danger of a human being subjected to social\n\nopprobrium or disapproval, as reflected in the punishment of crime. Hence the\n\nKoushal rationale that prosecution of a few is not an index of violation is flawed and\n\ncannot be accepted. Consequently, we disagree with the manner in which Koushal\n\nhas dealt with the privacy – dignity based claims of LGBT persons on this aspect.\n\n\nSince the challenge to Section 377 is pending consideration before a larger Bench of\n\nthis Court, we would leave the constitutional validity to be decided in an appropriate\n\nproceeding.</p><pre id=\"pre_11\">\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_416\">                                          125</span>\n\f                                                                                            PART J\n\n\nJ          India’s commitments under International law\n\n129        The recognition of privacy as a fundamental constitutional value is part of\n\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_128\">India’s commitment to a global human rights regime. <a href=\"/doc/854952/\" id=\"a_425\">Article 51</a> of the Constitution,\n\nwhich forms part of the Directive Principles, requires the State to endeavour to “foster\n\nrespect for international law and treaty obligations in the dealings of organised\n\npeoples with one another”221. <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_426\">Article 12</a> of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,\n\nrecognises the right to privacy:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_181\">                    “Article 12: No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with\n                    his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon\n                    his honour and reputation.

In 1849, in Prince Albert\n\nv Strange229 (1849), publication was sought to be restrained of otherwise unpublished\n\nprivate etchings and lists of works done by Prince Albert and Queen Victoria. In the\n\nHigh Court of Chancery, Lord Cottenham observed that:\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_195\">                “… where privacy is the right invaded, postponing the injunction\n                would be equivalent to denying it altogether.

In this case, when the appellant, after\n\nan accident, was recovering from brain surgery in a private hospital room, two\n\njournalists posed as doctors and took photographs of him. The appellant attempted to\n\nobtain an order to restrain publication of the photographs.

The applicant (the chairman and\n\nmanaging director of a company) was charged of doing acts with the intent to defraud\n\nits creditors.

It was held that the powers of the\n\nDirector of the Serious Fraud Office, under the Criminal Justice Act 1987, entitled\n\nhim/her to compel the applicant to answer questions on pain of commission of a\n\ncriminal offence. Lord Mustill, who delivered the leading opinion of the Court, held\n\nthat:\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_197\">                “[It] is a simple reflection of the common view that one person\n                should so far as possible be entitled to tell another person to mind\n                his own business. All civilised states recognise this assertion of\n                personal liberty and privacy. Equally, although there may be\n                pronounced disagreements between states, and between individual\n                citizens within states, about where the line should be drawn, few\n                would dispute that some curtailment of the liberty is indispensable\n                to the stability of society; and indeed in the United Kingdom today\n                our lives are permeated by enforceable duties to provide\n                information on demand, created by Parliament and tolerated by the\n                majority, albeit in some cases with reluctance.”\n\n\n\nLord Mustill’s statement “underlines the approach taken by the common law to\n\nprivacy” that “it recognised privacy as a principle of general value” and that “privacy\n\nhad only been given discrete and specific protection at common law”.232\n\n\nThis approach was diluted in the case of Wainwright v Home Office233(2004), where\n\na mother and son were subjected to a strip-search when visiting a prison in 1997, in\n\naccordance with existing Prison Rules. The son, who was mentally impaired and\n\nsuffered from cerebral palsy, later developed post-traumatic stress disorder.

The established doctrine is that this liberty may not be\n            interfered with, under the guise of protecting the public interest, by\n            legislative action which is arbitrary or without reasonable relation to some\n            purpose within the competency of the State to effect.”\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_464\">247</span>\n      262 US 390 (1923)\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_465\">                                                   142</span>\n\f                                                                                           PART K\n\n\nTwo years later, in Pierce v Society of Sisters248 (1925), the Court, relying upon\n\nMayer v Nebraska, struck down the Oregon Compulsory Education Act, which\n\nmandated all children (between eight and sixteen years) to attend public schools. It\n\nwas held the said statute is an “unreasonable interference with the liberty of the\n\nparents and guardians to direct the upbringing of the children, and in that respect\n\nviolates the Fourteenth Amendment”.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_137\">In Olmstead v United States249 (1928), the question before the Court was whether\n\nthe use of evidence of private telephone conversations, intercepted by means of\n\nwiretapping amounted to a violation of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments. In a 5:4\n\ndecision, it was held that there was no violation of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments.\n\nChief Justice Taft wrote the majority judgment, holding that:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_222\">                   “The Amendment itself shows that the search is to be of material\n                   things -- the person, the house, his papers, or his effects…. The\n                   Amendment does not forbid what was done here. There was no\n                   searching. There was no seizure. The evidence was secured by the\n                   use of the sense of hearing, and that only. There was no entry of\n                   the houses or offices of the defendants.”\n\n\n\n\nHowever, Justice Louis Brandeis wrote a dissenting opinion and observed that:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_223\">                   “… time works changes, brings into existence new conditions and\n                   purposes.&quot; Subtler and more far-reaching means of invading\n                   privacy have become available to the Government. Discovery and\n                   invention have made it possible for the Government, by means far\n                   more effective than stretching upon the rack, to obtain disclosure in\n                   court of what is whispered in the closet.

Ways may someday be developed by\n                  which the Government, without removing papers from secret\n                  drawers, can reproduce them in court, and by which it will be\n                  enabled to expose to a jury the most intimate occurrences of the\n                  home.

Justice Brandeis answers this question in a celebrated passage:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_224\">                  “The makers of our Constitution undertook to secure conditions\n                  favorable to the pursuit of happiness.

They conferred, as against the Government, the\n                  right to be let alone -- the most comprehensive of rights, and\n                  the right most valued by civilized men. To protect that right,\n                  every unjustifiable intrusion by the Government upon the privacy of\n                  the individual, whatever the means employed, must be deemed a\n                  violation of the Fourth Amendment...” (emphasis supplied)\n\n\n\nThe Court, in the case of Griswold v Connecticut250 (1965), invalidated a state law\n\nprohibiting the possession, sale, and distribution of contraceptives to married couples,\n\nfor the reason that the law violated the right to marital privacy. Justice Douglas, who\n\ndelivered the main opinion, observed that this right emanated from “penumbras” of\n\nthe fundamental constitutional guarantees and rights in the Bill of Rights, which\n\ntogether create “zones of privacy”. Accordingly, it was held that:\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_469\">250</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_225\">      381 US 479 (1965)\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_470\">                                                  144</span>\n\f                                                                                             PART K\n\n\n                  “The present case, then concerns a relationship lying within the\n                  zone of privacy created by several fundamental constitutional\n                  guarantees… Would we allow the police to search the sacred\n                  precincts of marital bedrooms of telltale signs of the use of\n                  contraceptives? The very idea is repulsive to the notions of privacy\n                  surrounding the marriage relationship.”\n\n\n\nJustice Goldberg wrote in the concurring opinion that:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_226\">                  “The fact that no particular provision of the Constitution explicitly\n                  forbids the State from disrupting the traditional relation of the family\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_227\">                  -- a relation as old and as fundamental as our entire civilization --\n                  surely does not show that the Government was meant to have the\n                  power to do so. Rather, as the Ninth Amendment expressly\n                  recognizes, there are fundamental personal rights such as this one,\n                  which are protected from abridgment by the Government, though\n                  not specifically mentioned in the Constitution.”\n\n\nThe 1967 decision in Katz v United States251 (“Katz”) overruled Olmstead v United\n\nStates (supra) and revolutionized the interpretation of the Fourth Amendment\n\nregarding the extent to which a constitutional right to privacy applies against\n\ngovernment interference. In this case, Charles Katz was a gambler who used a public\n\ntelephone booth to transmit illegal wagers. Unbeknownst to Katz, the FBI which was\n\ninvestigating Katz’s activity, was recording his conversations via an electronic\n\neavesdropping device attached to the exterior of the phone booth. Subsequently, Katz\n\nwas convicted based on these recordings. He challenged his conviction, arguing that\n\nthe recordings were obtained in violation of his Fourth Amendment rights. The\n\nconstitutional question in the case was whether the 4th Amendment protection from\n\n‘unreasonable searches and seizures’ was restricted to the search and seizure of\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_471\">251</span>\n      389 US 347 (1967)\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_472\">                                                    145</span>\n\f                                                                                 PART K\n\n\ntangible property, or did it extend to intangible areas such as conversations overheard\n\nby others. It was held that the Government&#x27;s eavesdropping activities violated the\n\nprivacy, upon which petitioner justifiably relied, while using the telephone booth, and\n\nthus constituted a “search and seizure” within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment,\n\nand that the Amendment governs not only the seizure of tangible items, but extends\n\nas well to the recording of oral statements.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_138\">Prior to 1967 when determining the ‘reasonable expectation of privacy’ for purposes\n\nof discussing Fourth Amendment violations, the analysis was focused on whether the\n\nauthority had trespassed on a private location. This ‘trespass doctrine’ was the\n\nprevailing test until Katz, which extended the protection of the Fourth Amendment\n\nfrom ‘places’ to ‘people’, affording individuals more privacy even in public. The\n\n‘trespass doctrine’ applied in Olmstead v United States (supra) was held to be no\n\nlonger relevant.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_139\">\nJustice Stewart wrote the majority (7:1) opinion and held that:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_228\">             “One who occupies it [a telephone booth], shuts the door behind\n             him, and pays the toll that permits him to place a call is surely\n             entitled to assume that the words he utters into the\n             mouthpiece will not be broadcast to the world.

Generally, as here, the answer to that question requires\n                  reference to a &quot;place.&quot; My understanding of the rule that has\n                  emerged from prior decisions is that there is a twofold requirement,\n                  first that a person has exhibited an actual (subjective)\n                  expectation of privacy and, second, that the expectation be\n                  one that society is prepared to recognize as &quot;reasonable.&quot;\n                  Thus, a man&#x27;s home is, for most purposes, a place where he\n                  expects privacy, but objects, activities, or statements that he\n                  exposes to the &quot;plain view&quot; of outsiders are not &quot;protected,&quot;\n                  because no intention to keep them to himself has been\n                  exhibited.

The constitutionality of a Texas Statute prohibiting abortions\n\nexcept with respect to those procured or admitted by medical advice for the purpose\n\nof saving the life of the mother was challenged on the ground that the law improperly\n\ninvaded the right and the choice of a pregnant woman to terminate her pregnancy and\n\nwas violative of the “liberty” guaranteed under the Fourteenth Amendment and the\n\nright to privacy recognized in Griswold. The Court ruled 7:2 that a right to privacy\n\nunder the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment extended to a woman&#x27;s\n\ndecision to have an abortion, but that this right must be balanced against the state&#x27;s\n\ninterests in regulating abortions.

In this case federal agents were investigating the defendant\n\nfor his involvement in a bootlegging conspiracy. The agents subpoenaed two banks\n\nand received his bank records. As a result, he was indicted. The question was whether\n\nan individual reasonably can expect that records kept incidental to his personal\n\nbanking transactions will be protected from uncontrolled government inspection. In a\n\n6:3 opinion, the Supreme Court held that a bank depositor has no Fourth Amendment\n\ninterest in the records that his bank is required to keep in compliance with the Bank\n\nSecrecy Act of 1970, and that Miller had no right to privacy in his bank records.

[that] the right… [is] based on a notion of the unencumbered\n                  self, but on the notion of what is necessary to have one’s own\n                  autonomous identity”.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_286\">The Court observed that like every other right, the right to privacy also has its limits:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_287\">                  “[67] In the context of privacy it is only the inner sanctum of a person,\n                  such as his/her family life, sexual preference and home environment,\n                  which is shielded from erosion by conflicting rights of the community.\n                  This implies that community rights and the rights of fellow members\n                  place a corresponding obligation on a citizen, thereby shaping the\n                  abstract notion of individualism towards identifying a concrete member\n                  of civil society. Privacy is acknowledged in the truly personal realm, but\n                  as a person moves into communal relations and activities such as\n                  business and social interaction, the scope of personal space shrinks\n                  accordingly.”\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_516\">274</span>\n      1996 (2) SA 751 (CC)\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_517\">                                                   166</span>\n\f                                                                                                PART K\n\n\nThe constitutional validity of laws making sodomy an offence was challenged in\n\nNational Coalition for Gay and Lesbian Equality v Minister of Justice275 (1999).\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_288\">It was held that the common law offence of sodomy was inconsistent with the\n\nConstitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996.

The way\n                   in which we give expression to our sexuality is at the core of this area\n                   of private intimacy. If, in expressing our sexuality, we act consensually\n                   and without harming one another, invasion of that precinct will be a\n                   breach of our privacy…”\n\nSachs J. discussed the interrelation between equality and privacy and held that:\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_290\">                   “...equality and privacy cannot be separated, because they are both\n                   violated simultaneously by anti-sodomy laws. In the present matter,\n                   such laws deny equal respect for difference, which lies at the heart of\n                   equality, and become the basis for the invasion of privacy. At the same\n                   time, the negation by the state of different forms of intimate personal\n                   behaviour becomes the foundation for the repudiation of equality.”\n\n\n\nOn the meaning of ‘autonomy’, the Court observed that:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_291\">                   “Autonomy must mean far more than the right to occupy an\n                   envelope of space in which a socially detached individual can act\n                   freely from interference by the state. What is crucial is the nature\n                   of the activity, not its site. While recognising the unique worth of each\n                   person, the Constitution does not presuppose that a holder of rights\n                   is as an isolated, lonely and abstract figure possessing a disembodied\n                   and socially disconnected self.

The personal and intimate\n                nature of an individual’s health information, unlike other forms of\n                documentation, reflects delicate decisions and choices relating to\n                issues pertaining to bodily and psychological integrity and personal\n                autonomy…\n\n                Individuals value the privacy of confidential medical information\n                because of the vast number of people who could have access to the\n                information and the potential harmful effects that may result from\n                disclosure. The lack of respect for private medical information and its\n                subsequent disclosure may result in fear jeopardising an individual’s\n                right to make certain fundamental choices that he/she has a right to\n                make. There is therefore a strong privacy interest in maintaining\n                confidentiality.”\n\n\n\nThe decision of the Court was that there must be a pressing social need for the right\n\nto privacy to be interfered with and that there was no such compelling public interest\n\nin this case.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_300\">In the dissenting opinion, Justice O’Regan held that the publication of the names and\n\nHIV status of the women was neither intentional nor negligent.

That decision should not be made by others. This\n             aspect of the right to privacy must be respected by all of us, not only\n             the state.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_303\">             …Secondly, we value privacy as a necessary part of a\n             democratic society and as a constraint on the power of the\n             state... In authoritarian societies, the state generally does not afford\n             such protection. People and homes are often routinely searched\n             and the possibility of a private space from which the state can be\n             excluded is often denied. The consequence is a denial of liberty and\n             human dignity. In democratic societies, this is impermissible.”\n             (emphasis supplied)\n\n\n\nThe limits of the right to privacy and the need to balance it with other rights emerge\n\nfrom the following observations:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_304\">             “Recognition of legitimate limits on the inviolability of personal\n             space, however, does not mean that the space is not worthy of\n             protection. The Constitution seeks to ensure that rights reinforce\n             one another in a constructive manner in order to promote human\n             rights generally. At times our Constitution recognises that a balance\n             has to be found to provide protection for the different rights.”\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_526\">                                               171</span>\n\f                                                                                        PART K\n\n\n     On the inter-relationship between the right to privacy, liberty and dignity, the Court\n\n     observed that:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_305\">                  “The right to privacy recognises the importance of protecting the\n                  sphere of our personal daily lives from the public. In so doing, it\n                  highlights the inter-relationship between privacy, liberty and\n                  dignity as the key constitutional rights which construct our\n                  understanding of what it means to be a human being. All these\n                  rights are therefore inter-dependent and mutually reinforcing.\n                  We value privacy for this reason at least – that the constitutional\n                  conception of being a human being asserts and seeks to foster the\n                  possibility of human beings choosing how to live their lives within\n                  the overall framework of a broader community.” (emphasis\n                  supplied)\n\n\n\n     The interim as well as the Final Constitution of South Africa contain explicit provisions\n\n     guaranteeing the right to privacy. The Judges of South African Supreme Court have\n\n     given an expansive meaning to the right, making significant inter-linkages between\n\n     equality, privacy and dignity. In doing so, it has been acknowledged that the right to\n\n     privacy does not exist in a vacuum, its contravention having a significant bearing on\n\n     other citizen rights as well.

This was also the first Supreme Court of Canada decision to consider <a href=\"/doc/406500/\" id=\"a_491\">Section\n\n8</a> of the Charter.

This decision was based on\n\nthe ground that the pattern of electricity consumption revealed as a result of computer\n\ninvestigations could not be said to reveal intimate details since “electricity\n\nconsumption reveals very little about the personal lifestyle or private decisions.”\n\n\nIn Her Majesty, The Queen v Walter Tessling286 (2004), the Supreme Court of\n\nCanada held that the use of thermal imaging by the police in the course of an\n\ninvestigation of a suspect&#x27;s property did not constitute a violation of the accused&#x27;s\n\nright to a reasonable expectation of privacy under <a href=\"/doc/406500/\" id=\"a_504\">Section 8</a> of the Canadian Charter.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_317\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"615307\" id=\"span_539\">On the reasonable expectation of privacy, it was held that the totality of circumstances\n\nneed to be considered with particular emphasis on both the existence of a subjective\n\nexpectation of privacy, and the objective reasonableness of the expectation.

The Canadian Supreme Court\n\nunanimously ruled that the request for an IP address infringed the Charter&#x27;s guarantee\n\nagainst unreasonable search and seizure. It was held that the appellant had a\n\nreasonable expectation of privacy. In doing so, it assessed whether there is a\n\n“reasonable expectation of privacy” in the “totality of the circumstances”, which\n\nincludes “the nature of the privacy interests implicated by the state action” and “factors\n\nmore directly concerned with the expectation of privacy, both subjectively and\n\nobjectively viewed, in relation to those interests”.

The Court applied a\n\nbroad approach in understanding the online privacy interests and held that:\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_319\">             “Privacy is admittedly a &quot;broad and somewhat evanescent concept&quot;...\n             [T]he Court has described three broad types of privacy interests -\n             territorial, personal, and informational - which, while often overlapping,\n             have proved helpful in identifying the nature of the privacy interest or\n             interests at stake in particular situations…”\n\n\nThe Court found that the nature of appellant’s privacy interest in subscriber\n\ninformation relating to a computer used privately was primarily an informational\n\none and held:\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_320\">             “... the identity of a person linked to their use of the Internet must be\n             recognized as giving rise to a privacy interest beyond that inherent in\n             the person’s name, address and telephone number found in the\n             subscriber information.”\n\n\nIt then set out three key elements of informational privacy: privacy as secrecy,\n\nprivacy as control, and privacy as anonymity. It further emphasised on the\n\nimportance of anonymity in informational privacy, particularly in the age of the\n\nInternet and held that:\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_321\">             “... anonymity may, depending on the totality of the circumstances, be\n             the foundation of a privacy interest that engages constitutional\n             protection against unreasonable search and seizure...”\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_545\">                                              179</span>\n\f                                                                                               PART K\n\n\n\n   Though the Court stopped short of recognizing an absolute right to anonymity, it held\n\n   that “anonymous Internet activity engages a high level of informational privacy”. The\n\n   Court further held that:\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_322\">                 “The disclosure of this information will often amount to the identification\n                 of a user with intimate or sensitive activities being carried out online,\n                 usually on the understanding that these activities would be anonymous.\n                 A request by a police officer that an ISP voluntarily disclose such\n                 information amounts to a search.”\n\n\n    The Canadian Supreme Court has used provisions of the Charter to expand the\n\n    scope of the right to privacy, used traditionally to protect individuals from an invasion\n\n    of their property rights, to an individual’s “reasonable expectation of privacy”. The\n\n    right to privacy has been held to be more than just a physical right as it includes the\n\n    privacy in information about one’s identity. Informational privacy has frequently been\n\n    addressed under <a href=\"/doc/406500/\" id=\"a_508\">Section 8</a> of the Charter. Canadian privacy jurisprudence has\n\n    developed with the advent of technology and the internet.

The first is the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR),\n\n   an international agreement to protect human rights and fundamental freedoms in\n\n   Europe. The second is the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union\n\n   (CFREU), a treaty enshrining certain political, social, and economic rights for the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_546\">                                                  180</span>\n\f                                                                                         PART K\n\n\nEuropean Union. Under ECHR (“the Convention”), the European Court of Human\n\nRights (ECtHR), also known as the ‘Strasbourg Court’, is the adjudicating body, which\n\nhears complaints by individuals on alleged breaches of human rights by signatory\n\nstates. Similarly, under CFREU (“the Charter), the Court of Justice of the European\n\nUnion (CJEU), also called the ‘Luxembourg Court’, is the chief judicial authority of the\n\nEuropean Union and oversees the uniform application and interpretation of European\n\nUnion law, in co-operation with the national judiciary of the member states.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_148\"><a href=\"/doc/691208/\" id=\"a_509\">Article 8</a> of the ECHR provides that:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_324\">             “Right to respect for private and family life\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_325\">             1.

Moreover, in the pre-\n\nCharter era, the protection of privacy was held to form part of the right to privacy in\n\nline with how the ECtHR in Strasbourg interprets <a href=\"/doc/691208/\" id=\"a_515\">Art. 8</a> of ECHR till date288.\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_548\">288</span>\n   In the case of J McB v LE, Case C-400/10 PPU, [2010] ECR I-nyr, the CJEU ruled that where Charter rights\nparalleled ECHR rights, the Court of Justice should follow any consistent jurisprudence of the European Court of\nHuman Rights, elucidating that: “It is clear that the said <a href=\"/doc/735354/\" id=\"a_516\">Article 7 [</a>of the EU Charter] contains rights corresponding\nto those guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1266611/\" id=\"a_517\">Article 8(1)</a> of the ECHR. <a href=\"/doc/735354/\" id=\"a_518\">Article 7</a> of the Charter must therefore be given the same\nmeaning and the same scope as <a href=\"/doc/1266611/\" id=\"a_519\">Article 8(1)</a> of the ECHR...” Reference can be passed to a case before ECtHR,\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_549\">                                                        182</span>\n\f                                                                                                          PART K\n\n\nThus, in order to understand the protection extended to the right to privacy in EU, the\n\njurisprudence of <a href=\"/doc/691208/\" id=\"a_520\">Article 8</a> of the Convention and <a href=\"/doc/735354/\" id=\"a_521\">Article 7</a> of the Charter need to be\n\nanalyzed. The term ‘private life’ is an essential ingredient of both these provisions and\n\nhas been interpreted to encompass a wide range of interests.\n\n\nIn the case of Niemietz v Germany289 (1992), the ECtHR observed that:\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_330\">                 “The Court does not consider it possible or necessary to attempt an\n                 exhaustive definition of the notion of &quot;private life&quot;.

That only a limited part of this information is actually\n             extracted or used by the authorities through DNA profiling and that no\n             immediate detriment is caused in a particular case does not change\n             this conclusion… [T]he DNA profiles&#x27; capacity to provide a means of\n             identifying genetic relationships between individuals… is in itself\n             sufficient to conclude that their retention interferes with the right to the\n             private life of the individuals concerned... The possibility the DNA\n             profiles create for inferences to be drawn as to ethnic origin makes their\n             retention all the more sensitive and susceptible of affecting the right to\n             private life.”\n\n\n\nRegarding retention of fingerprints, it was held that:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_347\">             “...fingerprints objectively contain unique information about the\n             individual concerned allowing his or her identification with precision in\n             a wide range of circumstances.

Given that the investigation concerned\n                   very serious crimes, the Court found that the GPS surveillance of Mr\n                   Uzun had been proportionate.”\n\n\nThe decision of the CJEU in the case Asociación Nacional de Establecimientos\n\nFinancieros de Crédito (ASNEF) v Spain294 relied upon the <a href=\"/doc/735354/\" id=\"a_538\">Article 7</a> right to respect\n\nfor private life and <a href=\"/doc/1266611/\" id=\"a_539\">Article 8(1)</a> of the Charter to find that the implementation in Spain\n\nof the Data Protection Directive was defective in that it applied only to information kept\n\nin a specified public data bank rather than more generally to public and private\n\ndatabases, on the basis that “the processing of data appearing in non-public sources\n\nnecessarily implies that information relating to the data subject’s private life will\n\nthereafter be known by the data controller and, as the case may be, by the third party\n\nor parties to whom the data is disclosed.

Other critiques argue that privacy\n              interests are not distinctive because the personal interests they\n              protect are economically inefficient (Posner, 1981) or that they are\n              not grounded in any adequate legal doctrine (Bork, 1990).

The recent\n                additions of social media, mobile platforms, cloud computing, data\n                mining, and predictive analytics now threaten to tip the scales\n                entirely, placing privacy in permanent opposition to the progress of\n                knowledge.”304\n\n\nThe article proceeds to explain that the perception of privacy as antiquated and\n\nsocially retrograde is wrong. Nonetheless, this criticism has relevance to India. The\n\nnation aspires to move to a knowledge based economy. Information is the basis of\n\nknowledge. The scales must, according to this critique, tip in favour of the paramount\n\nnational need for knowledge, innovation and development. These concerns cannot\n\nbe discarded and must be factored in.

The effect of the clauses upon the sections of the\n                   <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_555\">Indian Evidence Act</a> bearing upon privilege will have to be\n                   considered.

The opening words of the clause\n                 “public order and morality” would not be of any avail in such cases.\n                 On a very careful consideration of the whole subject I feel that\n                 inclusion of such a clause in the chapter on fundamental rights will\n                 lead to endless complications and difficulties in the administration\n                 of justice.

Unreasonable searches, In regard to this subject I\n                 pointed out the difference between the conditions obtaining in\n                 America at the time when the American Constitution was drafted\n                 and the conditions in India obtaining at present after the provisions\n                 of the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_556\">Criminal Procedure Code</a> in this behalf have been in force for\n                 nearly a century. The effect of the clause, as it is, will be to abrogate\n                 some of the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_557\">Criminal Procedure Code</a> and to leave\n                 it to the Supreme Court in particular cases to decide whether the\n                 search is reasonable or unreasonable.

Such an inclusion was, however, objected to on the\n\nfollowing grounds327 :\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_387\">                 “…It is also hardly necessary to include secrecy of postal,\n                 telegraphic and telephonic communications as a fundamental right\n                 in the Constitution itself as that might lead to practical difficulties in\n\n\n  B.

The\n\nobjection to clause 9(d) was set out in the note of dissent of Sir Alladi Krishnaswamy\n\nIyer and it was his view that the guarantee of secrecy of correspondence may lead to\n\nevery private correspondence becoming a state paper. There was also a feeling that\n\nthis would affect the prosecution especially in cases of conspiracy or abetment.\n\nSimilarly, his objection to clause 10 was that it would abrogate some of the provisions\n\nof the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_560\">Code of Criminal Procedure</a>. B N Rau likewise stated that this would seriously\n\naffect the powers of investigation of the police. The clause protecting the secrecy of\n\ncorrespondence was thus dropped on the ground that it would constitute a serious\n\nimpediment in prosecutions while the protection against unreasonable searches and\n\nseizures was deleted on the ground that there were provisions in the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_561\">Code of Criminal\n\nProcedure</a>, 1898 covering the area. The debates of the Constituent Assembly indicate\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_618\">                                            207</span>\n\f                                                                                  PART M\n\n\nthat the proposed inclusion (which was eventually dropped) was in two specific areas\n\nnamely correspondence and searches and seizures. From this, it cannot be concluded\n\nthat the Constituent Assembly had expressly resolved to reject the notion of the right\n\nto privacy as an integral element of the liberty and freedoms guaranteed by the\n\nfundamental rights.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_186\">\n\n\n149   The Constitution has evolved over time, as judicial interpretation, led to the\n\nrecognition of specific interests and entitlements. These have been subsumed within\n\nthe freedoms and liberties guaranteed by the Constitution.         <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_562\">Article 21</a> has been\n\ninterpreted by this Court to mean that life does not mean merely a physical existence.\n\nIt includes all those faculties by which life is enjoyed. The ambit of ‘the procedure\n\nestablished by law’ has been interpreted to mean that the procedure must be fair, just\n\nand reasonable. The coalescence of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_563\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_564\">, 19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_565\">21</a> has brought into being a\n\njurisprudence which recognises the inter-relationship between rights. That is how the\n\nrequirements of fairness and non-discrimination animate both the substantive and\n\nprocedural aspects of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_566\">Article 21.</a> These constitutional developments have taken place\n\nas the words of the Constitution have been interpreted to deal with new exigencies\n\nrequiring an expansive reading of liberties and freedoms to preserve human rights\n\nunder the rule of law. India’s brush with a regime of the suspension of life and personal\n\nliberty in the not too distant past is a grim reminder of how tenuous liberty can be, if\n\nthe judiciary is not vigilant. The interpretation of the Constitution cannot be frozen by\n\nits original understanding. The Constitution has evolved and must continuously evolve\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_619\">                                          208</span>\n\f                                                                                 PART M\n\n\nto meet the aspirations and challenges of the present and the future. Nor can judges\n\nforesee every challenge and contingency which may arise in the future. This is\n\nparticularly of relevance in an age where technology reshapes our fundamental\n\nunderstanding of information, knowledge and human relationships that was unknown\n\neven in the recent past. Hence as Judges interpreting the Constitution today, the\n\nCourt must leave open the path for succeeding generations to meet the challenges to\n\nprivacy that may be unknown today.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_187\">\n\n150   The impact of the decision in Cooper is to establish a link between the\n\nfundamental rights guaranteed by Part III of the Constitution. The immediate\n\nconsequence of the decision is that a law which restricts the personal liberties\n\ncontained in <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_567\">Article 19</a> must meet the test of permissible restrictions contemplated by\n\nClauses 2 to 6 in relation to the fundamental freedom which is infringed. Moreover,\n\nsince the fundamental rights are inter-related, <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_568\">Article 21</a> is no longer to be construed\n\nas a residue of rights which are not specifically enumerated in <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_569\">Article 19.</a> Both sets\n\nof rights overlap and hence a law which affects one of the personal freedoms under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_570\">Article 19</a> would, in addition to the requirement of meeting the permissible restrictions\n\ncontemplated in clauses 2 to 6, have to meet the parameters of a valid ‘procedure\n\nestablished by law’ under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_571\">Article 21</a> where it impacts on life or personal liberty. The\n\nlaw would be assessed not with reference to its object but on the basis of its effect\n\nand impact on the fundamental rights. Coupled with the breakdown of the theory that\n\nthe fundamental rights are water-tight compartments, the post Maneka jurisprudence\n\ninfused the test of fairness and reasonableness in determining whether the ‘procedure\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_620\">                                          209</span>\n\f                                                                                PART M\n\n\nestablished by law’ passes muster under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_572\">Article 21.</a> At a substantive level, the\n\nconstitutional values underlying each article in the Chapter on fundamental rights\n\nanimate the meaning of the others. This development of the law has followed a natural\n\nevolution. The basis of this development after all is that every aspect of the diverse\n\nguarantees of fundamental rights deals with human beings. Every element together\n\nwith others contributes in the composition of the human personality. In the very nature\n\nof things, no element can be read in a manner disjunctive from the composite whole.\n\nThe close relationship between each of the fundamental rights has led to the\n\nrecognition of constitutional entitlements and interests. Some of them may straddle\n\nmore than one, and on occasion several, fundamental rights. Yet others may reflect\n\nthe core value upon which the fundamental rights are founded. Even at the birth of\n\nthe Constitution, the founding fathers recognised in the Constituent Assembly that, for\n\ninstance, the freedom of speech and expression would comprehend the freedom of\n\nthe press. Hence the guarantee of free speech and expression has been interpreted\n\nto extend to the freedom of the press. Recognition of the freedom of the press does\n\nnot create by judicial fiat, a new fundamental right but is an acknowledgment of that,\n\nwhich lies embedded and without which the guarantee of free speech and expression\n\nwould not be complete.       Similarly, <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_573\">Article 21</a> has been interpreted to include a\n\nspectrum of entitlements such as a right to a clean environment, the right to public\n\nhealth, the right to know, the right to means of communication and the right to\n\neducation, besides a panoply of rights in the context of criminal law and procedure in\n\nmatters such as handcuffing and speedy trial.

The Constitution adopted a democratic form of\n\ngovernment based on the rule of law. The framers were conscious of the widespread\n\nabuse of human rights by authoritarian regimes in the two World Wars separated over\n\na period of two decades. The framers were equally conscious of the injustice suffered\n\nunder a colonial regime and more recently of the horrors of partition. The backdrop\n\nof human suffering furnished a reason to preserve a regime of governance based on\n\nthe rule of law which would be subject to democratic accountability against a violation\n\nof fundamental freedoms.

Information technology together with\n\nthe internet and the social media and all their attendant applications have rapidly\n\naltered the course of life in the last decade. Today’s technology renders models of\n\napplication of a few years ago obsolescent. Hence, it would be an injustice both to the\n\ndraftsmen of the Constitution as well as to the document which they sanctified to\n\nconstrict its interpretation to an originalist interpretation. Today’s problems have to be\n\nadjudged by a vibrant application of constitutional doctrine and cannot be frozen by a\n\nvision suited to a radically different society. We describe the Constitution as a living\n\ninstrument simply for the reason that while it is a document which enunciates eternal\n\nvalues for Indian society, it possesses the resilience necessary to ensure its continued\n\nrelevance. Its continued relevance lies precisely in its ability to allow succeeding\n\ngenerations to apply the principles on which it has been founded to find innovative\n\nsolutions to intractable problems of their times.       In doing so, we must equally\n\nunderstand that our solutions must continuously undergo a process of re-engineering.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_653\">                                           213</span>\n\f                                                                                    PART N\n\n\nN     Is the statutory protection to privacy reason to deny a constitutional right?\n\n\n152     The Union government and some of the States which have supported it have\n\nurged this Court that there is a statutory regime by virtue of which the right to privacy\n\nis adequately protected and hence it is not necessary to read a constitutional right to\n\nprivacy into the fundamental rights. This submission is sought to be fortified by\n\ncontending that privacy is merely a common law right and the statutory protection is\n\na reflection of that position.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_192\">\n\n153     The submission betrays lack of understanding of the reason why rights are\n\nprotected in the first place as entrenched guarantees in a Bill of Rights or, as in the\n\ncase of the Indian Constitution, as part of the fundamental rights. Elevating a right to\n\nthe position of a constitutionally protected right places it beyond the pale of legislative\n\nmajorities. When a constitutional right such as the right to equality or the right to life\n\nassumes the character of being a part of the basic structure of the Constitution, it\n\nassumes inviolable status: inviolability even in the face of the power of amendment.\n\nOrdinary legislation is not beyond the pale of legislative modification. A statutory right\n\ncan be modified, curtailed or annulled by a simple enactment of the legislature. In\n\nother words, statutory rights are subject to the compulsion of legislative majorities.\n\nThe purpose of infusing a right with a constitutional element is precisely to provide it\n\na sense of immunity from popular opinion and, as its reflection, from legislative\n\nannulment. Constitutionally protected rights embody the liberal belief that personal\n\nliberties of the individual are so sacrosanct that it is necessary to ensconce them in a\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_654\">                                           214</span>\n\f                                                                                    PART O\n\n\nprotective shell that places them beyond the pale of ordinary legislation. To negate a\n\nconstitutional right on the ground that there is an available statutory protection is to\n\ninvert constitutional theory. As a matter of fact, legislative protection is in many cases,\n\nan acknowledgment and recognition of a constitutional right which needs to be\n\neffectuated and enforced through protective laws.\n\n\nFor instance, the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_589\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the Right to Information Act, 2005\n\nwhich contain an exemption from the disclosure of information refer to such\n\ninformation which would cause an unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the\n\nindividual.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_193\">\n\n\nBut the important point to note is that when a right is conferred with an entrenched\n\nconstitutional status in Part III, it provides a touchstone on which the validity of\n\nexecutive decision making can be assessed and the validity of law can be determined\n\nby judicial review. Entrenched constitutional rights provide the basis of evaluating the\n\nvalidity of law. Hence, it would be plainly unacceptable to urge that the existence of\n\nlaw negates the rationale for a constitutional right or renders the constitutional right\n\nunnecessary.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_194\">\n</p><pre id=\"pre_17\">O      Not an elitist construct\n\n\n154    The Attorney General argued before us that the right to privacy must be\n\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_195\">forsaken in the interest of welfare entitlements provided by the State. In our view, the\n\nsubmission that the right to privacy is an elitist construct which stands apart from the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_655\">                                           215</span>\n\f                                                                                    PART O\n\n\nneeds and aspirations of the large majority constituting the rest of society, is\n\nunsustainable. This submission betrays a misunderstanding of the constitutional\n\nposition. Our Constitution places the individual at the forefront of its focus,\n\nguaranteeing civil and political rights in Part III and embodying an aspiration for\n\nachieving socio- economic rights in Part IV. The refrain that the poor need no civil\n\nand political rights and are concerned only with economic well-being has been utilised\n\nthough history to wreak the most egregious violations of human rights. Above all, it\n\nmust be realised that it is the right to question, the right to scrutinize and the right to\n\ndissent which enables an informed citizenry to scrutinize the actions of government.\n\nThose who are governed are entitled to question those who govern, about the\n\ndischarge of their constitutional duties including in the provision of socio-economic\n\nwelfare benefits. The power to scrutinize and to reason enables the citizens of a\n\ndemocratic polity to make informed decisions on basic issues which govern their\n\nrights. The theory that civil and political rights are subservient to socio-economic rights\n\nhas been urged in the past and has been categorically rejected in the course of\n\nconstitutional adjudication by this Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_196\">\n\n\n155    Civil and political rights and socio-economic rights do not exist in a state of\n\nantagonism. The conditions necessary for realising or fulfilling socio-economic rights\n\ndo not postulate the subversion of political freedom. The reason for this is simple.\n\nSocio-economic entitlements must yield true benefits to those for whom they are\n\nintended. This can be achieved by eliminating rent-seeking behaviour and by\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_656\">                                             216</span>\n\f                                                                                             PART O\n\n\npreventing the capture of social welfare benefits by persons who are not entitled to\n\nthem. Capture of social welfare benefits can be obviated only when political systems\n\nare transparent and when there is a free flow of information. Opacity enures to the\n\nbenefit of those who monopolize scarce economic resources. On the other hand,\n\nconditions where civil and political freedoms flourish ensure that governmental\n\npolicies are subjected to critique and assessment. It is this scrutiny which sub-serves\n\nthe purpose of ensuring that socio-economic benefits actually permeate to the under-\n\nprivileged for whom they are meant. Conditions of freedom and a vibrant assertion of\n\ncivil and political rights promote a constant review of the justness of socio-economic\n\nprogrammes and of their effectiveness in addressing deprivation and want. Scrutiny\n\nof public affairs is founded upon the existence of freedom. Hence civil and political\n\nrights and socio-economic rights are complementary and not mutually exclusive.\n\n\n\n\n156        Some of these themes have been addressed in the writings of the Nobel\n\nlaureate, Amartya Sen. Sen compares the response of many non-democratic regimes\n\nin critical situations such as famine with the responses of democratic societies in\n\nsimilar situations.343 His analysis reveals that the political immunity enjoyed by\n\ngovernment leaders in authoritarian states prevents effective measures being taken\n\nto address such conditions:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_405\">                   “For example, Botswana had a fall in food production of 17 percent\n                   and Zimbabwe one of 38 percent between 1979-1981 and 1983-\n                   1984, in the same period in which the food production decline\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_657\">343</span>\n      Amartya Sen, Development as Freedom, Oxford University Press (2000), at page 178-179\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_658\">                                                     217</span>\n\f                                                                                      PART O\n\n\n                amounted to a relatively modest 11 or 12 percent in Sudan and\n                Ethiopia. But while Sudan and Ethiopia, with comparatively smaller\n                declines in food output, had massive famines, Botswana and\n                Zimbabwe had none, and this was largely due to timely and\n                extensive famine prevention policies by these latter countries.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_406\">                Had the governments in Botswana and Zimbabwe failed to\n                undertake timely action, they would have been under severe\n                criticism and pressure from the opposition and would have gotten\n                plenty of flak from newspapers. In contrast, the Ethiopian and\n                Sudanese governments did not have to reckon with those\n                prospects, and the political incentives provided by democratic\n                institutions were thoroughly absent in those countries. Famines in\n                Sudan and Ethiopia – and in many other countries in sub-Saharan\n                Africa – were fed by the political immunity enjoyed by governmental\n                leaders in authoritarian countries. This would seem to apply to the\n                present situation in North Korea as well.”344\n\n\n\n\nIn the Indian context, Sen points out that the Bengal famine of 1943 “was made viable\n\nnot only by the lack of democracy in colonial India but also by severe restrictions on\n\nreporting and criticism imposed on the Indian press, and the voluntary practice of\n\n‘silence’ on the famine that the British-owned media chose to follow”345. Political\n\nliberties and democratic rights are hence regarded as ‘constituent components’ of\n\ndevelopment.346 In contrast during the drought which took place in Maharashtra in\n\n1973, food production failed drastically and the per capita food output was half of that\n\nin sub-Saharan Africa. Yet there was no famine in Maharashtra where five million\n\npeople were employed in rapidly organized public projects while there were\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_659\">344</span>\n    Ibid, at page 179\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_660\">345</span>\n    Amartya Sen, The Idea of Justice, Penguin Books (2009), at page 339\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_661\">346</span>\n    Ibid, at page 347\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_662\">                                                   218</span>\n\f                                                                                            PART O\n\n\nsubstantial famines in sub-Saharan Africa.

Famines kill millions of\n                   people in different countries in the world, but they don’t kill the\n                   rulers. The kings and the presidents, the bureaucrats and the\n                   bosses, the military leaders and the commanders never are famine\n                   victims. And if there are no elections, no opposition parties, no\n                   scope for uncensored public criticism, then those in authority don’t\n                   have to suffer the political consequences of their failure to prevent\n                   famines. Democracy, on the other hand, would spread the penalty\n                   of famines to the ruling groups and political leaders as well. This\n                   gives them the political incentive to try to prevent any threatening\n                   famine, and since famines are in fact easy to prevent (the economic\n                   argument clicks into the political one at this stage), the approaching\n                   famines are firmly prevented.”347\n\n\n\nThere is, in other words, an intrinsic relationship between development and freedom:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_408\">                   “…development cannot really be seen merely as the process of\n                   increasing inanimate objects of convenience, such as raising the\n                   GNP per head, or promoting industrialization or technological\n                   advance or social modernization. These accomplishments are, of\n                   course, valuable – often crucially important – but their value must\n                   depend on what they do to the lives and freedoms of the people\n                   involved. For adult human beings, with responsibility for choice, the\n                   focus must ultimately be on whether they have the freedom to do\n                   what they have reason to value.

Every individual in society irrespective of social class or\n\neconomic status is entitled to the intimacy and autonomy which privacy protects. It is\n\nprivacy as an intrinsic and core feature of life and personal liberty which enables an\n\nindividual to stand up against a programme of forced sterilization. Then again, it is\n\nprivacy which is a powerful guarantee if the State were to introduce compulsory drug\n\ntrials of non-consenting men or women. The sanctity of marriage, the liberty of\n\nprocreation, the choice of a family life and the dignity of being are matters which\n\nconcern every individual irrespective of social strata or economic well being. The\n\npursuit of happiness is founded upon autonomy and dignity.

The fact that a right may have been afforded protection\n\nat common law does not constitute a bar to the constitutional recognition of the right.\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_670\">                                          221</span>\n\f                                                                                                PART P\n\n\nThe Constitution recognises the right simply because it is an incident of a fundamental\n\nfreedom or liberty which the draftsperson considered to be so significant as to require\n\nconstitutional protection. Once privacy is held to be an incident of the protection of\n\nlife, personal liberty and of the liberties guaranteed by the provisions of Part III of the\n\nConstitution, the submission that privacy is only a right at common law misses the\n\nwood for the trees. The central theme is that privacy is an intrinsic part of life, personal\n\nliberty and of the freedoms guaranteed by Part III which entitles it to protection as a\n\ncore of constitutional doctrine. The protection of privacy by the Constitution liberates\n\nit, as it were, from the uncertainties of statutory law which, as we have noted, is subject\n\nto the range of legislative annulments open to a majoritarian government.

The Constitutional right is placed at a pedestal which embodies\n\nboth a negative and a positive freedom. The negative freedom protects the individual\n\nfrom unwanted intrusion.

The clause\n\nas originally drafted was subjected to three important changes in the Constituent\n\nAssembly. Firstly, the reference to property was deleted from the above clause of the\n\ndraft Constitution. The members of the Constituent Assembly perceived that retaining\n\nthe right to property as part of the due process clause would pose a serious\n\nimpediment to legislative reform particularly with the redistribution of property.

Moreover, 25 other statutes were\n\n struck down under the due process clause together with other provisions of the\n\n American Constitution.354 Under the due process clause, the US Supreme Court\n\n struck down labour legislation prohibiting employers from discriminating on the\n\n grounds of union activity; regulation of wages; regulation of prices for commodities\n\n and services; and legislation denying entry into business. 355 These decisions were\n\n eventually distinguished or overruled in 1937 and thereafter.356\n\n\n\n\n 160     The Constituent Assembly, in this background, made a second important\n\n change in the original draft by qualifying the expression ‘liberty’ with the word\n\n ‘personal’.

In the United States he met\n                   Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter, who told him that he\n                   considered the power of judicial review implied in the due process\n                   clause both undemocratic – because a few judges could veto\n                   legislation enacted by the representatives of a nation – and\n                   burdensome to the Judiciary. Frankfurter had been strongly\n                   influenced by the Harvard Law School’s great constitutional lawyer,\n                   James Bradley Thayer, who also feared that too great a reliance on\n                   due process as a protection against legislative oversight or\n                   misbehaviour might weaken the democratic process. Thayer’s\n                   views had impressed Rau even before he met Frankfurter. In his\n                   Constitutional Precedents, Rau had pointed out that Thayer and\n                   others had ‘drawn attention to the dangers of attempting to find in\n                   the Supreme Court – instead of in the lessons of experience – a\n                   safeguard against the mistakes of the representatives of people’.”\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_680\"> 357</span>\n     B.

One view is this; that the\n                legislature may be trusted not to make any law which would\n                abrogate the fundamental rights of man, so to say, the fundamental\n                rights which apply to every individual, and consequently, there is no\n                danger arising from the introduction of the phrase ‘due process’.\n                Another view is this : that it is not possible to trust the legislature;\n                the legislature is likely to err, is likely to be led away by passion, by\n                party prejudice, by party considerations, and the legislature may\n                make a law which may abrogate what may be regarded as the\n                fundamental principles which safeguard the individual rights of a\n                citizen. We are therefore placed in two difficult positions. One is to\n                give the judiciary the authority to sit in judgment over the will of the\n                legislature and to question the law made by the legislature on the\n                ground that it is not good law, in consonance with fundamental\n                principles. Is that a desirable principle? The second position is that\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_686\">361</span>\n    Granville Austin (Supra note 358), at page 105\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_687\">362</span>\n    Ibid, at pages 105-106\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_688\">363</span>\n    Constituent Assembly Debates, Vol. 7 (13th December 1948), available at\nhttp://parliamentofindia.nic.in/ls/debates/vol7p25a.htm\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_689\">                                                    227</span>\n\f                                                                                       PART Q\n\n\n             the legislature ought to be trusted not to make bad laws. It is very\n             difficult to come to any definite conclusion. There are dangers on\n             both sides. For myself I cannot altogether omit the possibility of a\n             Legislature packed by party men making laws which may abrogate\n             or violate what we regard as certain fundamental principles\n             affecting the life and liberty of an individual. At the same time, I do\n             not see how five or six gentlemen sitting in the Federal or Supreme\n             Court examining laws made by the Legislature and by dint of their\n             own individual conscience or their bias or their prejudices be trusted\n             to determine which law is good and which law is bad. It is rather a\n             case where a man has to sail between Charybdis and Scylla and I\n             therefor would not say anything. I would leave it to the House to\n             decide in any way it likes.”\n\n\nThe amendments proposed by some members to reintroduce ‘due process’ were\n\nrejected on 13 December 1948 and the phrase “due process of law” was deleted from\n\nthe original draft Constitution. However, <a href=\"/doc/581566/\" id=\"a_594\">Article 22</a> was introduced into the Constitution\n\nto protect against arbitrary arrest and detention by incorporating several safeguards.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_202\">162   In Gopalan, the Preventive Detention Act, 1950 was challenged on the ground\n\nthat it denied significant procedural safeguards against arbitrary detention. The\n\nmajority rejected the argument that the expression ‘procedure established by law’\n\nmeant procedural due process. Chief Justice Kania noted that <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_595\">Article 21</a> of our\n\nConstitution had consciously been drawn up by the draftsmen so as to not use the\n\nword ‘due process’ which was used in the American Constitution. Hence it was\n\nimpermissible to read the expression ‘procedure established by law’ to mean\n\n‘procedural due process’ or as requiring compliance with natural justice. Justice\n\nPatanjali Sastri held that reading the expression ‘due process of law’ into the\n\nConstitution was impermissible since it would lead to those ‘subtle and elusive criteria’\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_690\">                                              228</span>\n\f                                                                                      PART Q\n\n\nimplied in the phrase which it was the deliberate purpose of the framers of our\n\nConstitution to avoid. Similarly, Justice Das also observed that our Constitution\n\nmakers had deliberately declined to adopt “the uncertain and shifting American\n\ndoctrine of due process of law” which could not, therefore, be read into <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_596\">Article 21.</a>\n\nHence, the view of the majority was that once the procedure was established by a\n\nvalidly enacted law, <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_597\">Article 21</a> would not be violated.\n\n\n\n163    In his celebrated dissent, Justice Fazl Ali pointed out that the phrase ‘procedure\n\nestablished by law’ was borrowed from the Japanese Constitution (which was drafted\n\nunder American influence at the end of the Second World War) and hence the\n\nexpression means ‘procedural due process’. In Justice Fazl Ali’s view the deprivation\n\nof life and personal liberty under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_598\">Article 21</a>, had to be preceded by (i) a notice; (ii) an\n\nopportunity of being heard; (iii) adjudication by an impartial tribunal; and (iv) an orderly\n\ncourse of procedure. Formulating these four principles, Justice Fazl Ali held thus:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_418\">              “…Article 21 purports to protect life and personal liberty, and it\n              would be a precarious protection and a protection not worth having,\n              if the elementary principle of law under discussion which, according\n              to Halsbury is on a par with fundamental rights, is to be ignored and\n              excluded. In the course of his arguments, the learned counsel for\n              the petitioner repeatedly asked whether the Constitution would\n              permit a law being enacted, abolishing the mode of trial permitted\n              by the existing law and establishing the procedure of trial by battle\n              or trial by ordeal which was in vogue in olden times in England. The\n              question envisages something which is not likely to happen, but it\n              does raise a legal problem which can perhaps be met only in this\n              way that if the expression “procedure established by law” simply\n              means any procedure established or enacted by statute it will be\n              difficult to give a negative answer to the question, but if the word\n              “law” includes what I have endeavoured to show it does, such an\n              answer may be justified. It seems to me that there is nothing\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_691\">                                              229</span>\n\f                                                                                          PART Q\n\n\n                revolutionary in the doctrine that the words “procedure established\n                by law” must include the four principles set out in Professor Willis’\n                book, which, as I have already stated, are different aspects of the\n                same principle and which have no vagueness or uncertainty about\n                them. These principles, as the learned author points out and as the\n                authorities show, are not absolutely rigid principles but are\n                adaptable to the circumstances of each case within certain limits.

In the Constituent Assembly, the Drafting Committee chaired by Dr B\n\nR Ambedkar had included the phrase but it came to be deleted after a careful\n\nevaluation of the vagaries of the decision making process in the US involving\n\ninterpretation of the due process clause. Significantly, present to the mind of the\n\nframers of our Constitution was the invalidation of social welfare legislation in the US\n\non the anvil of the due process clause on the ground that it violated the liberty of\n\ncontract of men, women and children to offer themselves for work in a free market for\n\nlabour.

Privacy postulates the reservation of a\n\nprivate space for the individual, described as the right to be let alone. The concept is\n\nfounded on the autonomy of the individual. The ability of an individual to make choices\n\nlies at the core of the human personality. The notion of privacy enables the individual\n\nto assert and control the human element which is inseparable from the personality of\n\nthe individual. The inviolable nature of the human personality is manifested in the\n\nability to make decisions on matters intimate to human life. The autonomy of the\n\nindividual is associated over matters which can be kept private. These are concerns\n\nover which there is a legitimate expectation of privacy. The body and the mind are\n\ninseparable elements of the human personality. The integrity of the body and the\n\nsanctity of the mind can exist on the foundation that each individual possesses an\n\ninalienable ability and right to preserve a private space in which the human personality\n\ncan develop. Without the ability to make choices, the inviolability of the personality\n\nwould be in doubt. Recognizing a zone of privacy is but an acknowledgment that each\n\nindividual must be entitled to chart and pursue the course of development of\n\npersonality. Hence privacy is a postulate of human dignity itself. Thoughts and\n\nbehavioural patterns which are intimate to an individual are entitled to a zone of\n\nprivacy where one is free of social expectations. In that zone of privacy, an individual\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_754\">                                           242</span>\n\f                                                                                   PART R\n\n\nis not judged by others. Privacy enables each individual to take crucial decisions which\n\nfind expression in the human personality. It enables individuals to preserve their\n\nbeliefs, thoughts, expressions, ideas, ideologies, preferences and choices against\n\nsocietal demands of homogeneity. Privacy is an intrinsic recognition of heterogeneity,\n\nof the right of the individual to be different and to stand against the tide of conformity\n\nin creating a zone of solitude. Privacy protects the individual from the searching glare\n\nof publicity in matters which are personal to his or her life. Privacy attaches to the\n\nperson and not to the place where it is associated. Privacy constitutes the foundation\n\nof all liberty because it is in privacy that the individual can decide how liberty is best\n\nexercised. Individual dignity and privacy are inextricably linked in a pattern woven out\n\nof a thread of diversity into the fabric of a plural culture.\n\n\n\n169    Privacy of the individual is an essential aspect of dignity. Dignity has both an\n\nintrinsic and instrumental value. As an intrinsic value, human dignity is an entitlement\n\nor a constitutionally protected interest in itself. In its instrumental facet, dignity and\n\nfreedom are inseparably inter-twined, each being a facilitative tool to achieve the\n\nother. The ability of the individual to protect a zone of privacy enables the realization\n\nof the full value of life and liberty. Liberty has a broader meaning of which privacy is\n\na subset. All liberties may not be exercised in privacy. Yet others can be fulfilled only\n\nwithin a private space. Privacy enables the individual to retain the autonomy of the\n\nbody and mind. The autonomy of the individual is the ability to make decisions on\n\nvital matters of concern to life. Privacy has not been couched as an independent\n\nfundamental right. But that does not detract from the constitutional protection afforded\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_755\">                                             243</span>\n\f                                                                                  PART R\n\n\nto it, once the true nature of privacy and its relationship with those fundamental rights\n\nwhich are expressly protected is understood. Privacy lies across the spectrum of\n\nprotected freedoms. The guarantee of equality is a guarantee against arbitrary state\n\naction. It prevents the state from discriminating between individuals. The destruction\n\nby the state of a sanctified personal space whether of the body or of the mind is\n\nviolative of the guarantee against arbitrary state action. Privacy of the body entitles\n\nan individual to the integrity of the physical aspects of personhood. The intersection\n\nbetween one’s mental integrity and privacy entitles the individual to freedom of\n\nthought, the freedom to believe in what is right, and the freedom of self-determination.\n\nWhen these guarantees intersect with gender, they create a private space which\n\nprotects all those elements which are crucial to gender identity. The family, marriage,\n\nprocreation and sexual orientation are all integral to the dignity of the individual.\n\nAbove all, the privacy of the individual recognises an inviolable right to determine how\n\nfreedom shall be exercised.      An individual may perceive that the best form of\n\nexpression is to remain silent. Silence postulates a realm of privacy. An artist finds\n\nreflection of the soul in a creative endeavour. A writer expresses the outcome of a\n\nprocess of thought. A musician contemplates upon notes which musically lead to\n\nsilence. The silence, which lies within, reflects on the ability to choose how to convey\n\nthoughts and ideas or interact with others. These are crucial aspects of personhood.\n\nThe freedoms under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_672\">Article 19</a> can be fulfilled where the individual is entitled to decide\n\nupon his or her preferences. Read in conjunction with <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_673\">Article 21</a>, liberty enables the\n\nindividual to have a choice of preferences on various facets of life including what and\n\nhow one will eat, the way one will dress, the faith one will espouse and a myriad other\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_756\">                                          244</span>\n\f                                                                                      PART R\n\n\nmatters on which autonomy and self-determination require a choice to be made within\n\nthe privacy of the mind. The constitutional right to the freedom of religion under <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_674\">Article\n\n25</a> has implicit within it the ability to choose a faith and the freedom to express or not\n\nexpress those choices to the world. These are some illustrations of the manner in\n\nwhich privacy facilitates freedom and is intrinsic to the exercise of liberty.          The\n\nConstitution does not contain a separate article telling us that privacy has been\n\ndeclared to be a fundamental right. Nor have we tagged the provisions of Part III with\n\nan alpha suffixed right of privacy: this is not an act of judicial redrafting. Dignity cannot\n\nexist without privacy. Both reside within the inalienable values of life, liberty and\n\nfreedom which the Constitution has recognised. Privacy is the ultimate expression of\n\nthe sanctity of the individual. It is a constitutional value which straddles across the\n\nspectrum of fundamental rights and protects for the individual a zone of choice and\n\nself-determination.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_212\">\nPrivacy represents the core of the human personality and recognizes the ability of\n\neach individual to make choices and to take decisions governing matters intimate and\n\npersonal. Yet, it is necessary to acknowledge that individuals live in communities and\n\nwork in communities. Their personalities affect and, in turn are shaped by their social\n\nenvironment. The individual is not a hermit. The lives of individuals are as much a\n\nsocial phenomenon. In their interactions with others, individuals are constantly\n\nengaged in behavioural patterns and in relationships impacting on the rest of society.\n\nEqually, the life of the individual is being consistently shaped by cultural and social\n\nvalues imbibed from living in the community. This state of flux which represents a\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_757\">                                            245</span>\n\f                                                                                    PART S\n\n\nconstant evolution of individual personhood in the relationship with the rest of society\n\nprovides the rationale for reserving to the individual a zone of repose. The lives which\n\nindividuals lead as members of society engender a reasonable expectation of privacy.\n\nThe notion of a reasonable expectation of privacy has elements both of a subjective\n\nand objective nature. Privacy at a subjective level is a reflection of those areas where\n\nan individual desire to be left alone. On an objective plane, privacy is defined by those\n\nconstitutional values which shape the content of the protected zone where the\n\nindividual ought to be left alone. The notion that there must exist a reasonable\n\nexpectation of privacy ensures that while on the one hand, the individual has a\n\nprotected zone of privacy, yet on the other, the exercise of individual choices is subject\n\nto the rights of others to lead orderly lives. For instance, an individual who possesses\n\na plot of land may decide to build upon it subject to zoning regulations. If the building\n\nbye laws define the area upon which construction can be raised or the height of the\n\nboundary wall around the property, the right to privacy of the individual is conditioned\n\nby regulations designed to protect the interests of the community in planned spaces.\n\nHence while the individual is entitled to a zone of privacy, its extent is based not only\n\non the subjective expectation of the individual but on an objective principle which\n\ndefines a reasonable expectation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_213\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_214\">S     Informational privacy\n\n\n170   Ours is an age of information.

Online purchases have become an efficient substitute for the daily\n\n visit to the neighbouring store. Online banking has redefined relationships between\n\n bankers and customers. Online trading has created a new platform for the market in\n\n securities. Online music has refashioned the radio. Online books have opened up a\n\n new universe for the bibliophile. The old-fashioned travel agent has been rendered\n\n redundant by web portals which provide everything from restaurants to rest houses,\n\n airline tickets to art galleries, museum tickets to music shows.

Secondly, invasions of data\n\nprivacy are difficult to detect because they can be invisible. Information can be\n\naccessed, stored and disseminated without notice. Its ability to travel at the speed of\n\nlight enhances the invisibility of access to data, “information collection can be the\n\nswiftest theft of all”391.

It expresses a right to be left alone.\n\nA broader connotation which has emerged in academic literature of a comparatively\n\nrecent origin is related to the protection of one’s identity. Data protection relates\n\nclosely with the latter sphere. Data such as medical information would be a category\n\nto which a reasonable expectation of privacy attaches. There may be other data which\n\nfalls outside the reasonable expectation paradigm. Apart from safeguarding privacy,\n\ndata protection regimes seek to protect the autonomy of the individual. This is evident\n\nfrom the emphasis in the European data protection regime on the centrality of consent.\n\nRelated to the issue of consent is the requirement of transparency which requires a\n\ndisclosure by the data recipient of information pertaining to data transfer and use.\n\n\n\n178        Another aspect which data protection regimes seek to safeguard is the principle\n\nof non-discrimination which ensures that the collection of data should be carried out\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_774\">398</span>\n      Yvonne McDermott, “Conceptualizing the right to data protection in an era of Big Data”, Big Data and Society\n      (2017), at page 4.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_218\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_775\">                                                        252</span>\n\f                                                                                                    PART S\n\n\nin a manner which does not discriminate on the basis of racial or ethnic origin, political\n\nor religious beliefs, genetic or health status or sexual orientation.\n\n\n\n179     Formulation of a regime for data protection is a complex exercise which needs\n\nto be undertaken by the State after a careful balancing of the requirements of privacy\n\ncoupled with other values which the protection of data sub-serves together with the\n\nlegitimate concerns of the State.

Posner’s formulation would\n\nindicate that the State does have a legitimate interest when it monitors the web to\n\nsecure the nation against cyber attacks and the activities of terrorists.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_219\">180          While it intervenes to protect legitimate state interests, the state must\n\nnevertheless put into place a robust regime that ensures the fulfilment of a three-fold\n\nrequirement. These three requirements apply to all restraints on privacy (not just\n\ninformational privacy). They emanate from the procedural and content-based\n\nmandate of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_675\">Article 21.</a> The first requirement that there must be a law in existence to\n\njustify an encroachment on privacy is an express requirement of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_676\">Article 21.</a> For, no\n\nperson can be deprived of his life or personal liberty except in accordance with the\n\nprocedure established by law. The existence of law is an essential requirement.\n\nSecond, the requirement of a need, in terms of a legitimate state aim, ensures that\n\nthe nature and content of the law which imposes the restriction falls within the zone of\n\nreasonableness mandated by <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_677\">Article 14</a>, which is a guarantee against arbitrary state\n\naction. The pursuit of a legitimate state aim ensures that the law does not suffer from\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_778\">400</span>\n      Ibid\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_779\">401</span>\n      Ibid\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_780\">                                             254</span>\n\f                                                                                   PART S\n\n\nmanifest arbitrariness. Legitimacy, as a postulate, involves a value judgment. Judicial\n\nreview does not re-appreciate or second guess the value judgment of the legislature\n\nbut is for deciding whether the aim which is sought to be pursued suffers from palpable\n\nor manifest arbitrariness. The third requirement ensures that the means which are\n\nadopted by the legislature are proportional to the object and needs sought to be\n\nfulfilled by the law. Proportionality is an essential facet of the guarantee against\n\narbitrary state action because it ensures that the nature and quality of the\n\nencroachment on the right is not disproportionate to the purpose of the law. Hence,\n\nthe three-fold requirement for a valid law arises out of the mutual inter-dependence\n\nbetween the fundamental guarantees against arbitrariness on the one hand and the\n\nprotection of life and personal liberty, on the other. The right to privacy, which is an\n\nintrinsic part of the right to life and liberty, and the freedoms embodied in Part III is\n\nsubject to the same restraints which apply to those freedoms.\n\n\n\n181   Apart from national security, the state may have justifiable reasons for the\n\ncollection and storage of data. In a social welfare state, the government embarks\n\nupon programmes which provide benefits to impoverished and marginalised sections\n\nof society. There is a vital state interest in ensuring that scarce public resources are\n\nnot dissipated by the diversion of resources to persons who do not qualify as\n\nrecipients. Allocation of resources for human development is coupled with a legitimate\n\nconcern that the utilisation of resources should not be siphoned away for extraneous\n\npurposes. Data mining with the object of ensuring that resources are properly\n\ndeployed to legitimate beneficiaries is a valid ground for the state to insist on the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_781\">                                          255</span>\n\f                                                                                                     PART S\n\n\n collection of authentic data. But, the data which the state has collected has to be\n\n utilised for legitimate purposes of the state and ought not to be utilised unauthorizedly\n\n for extraneous purposes. This will ensure that the legitimate concerns of the state are\n\n duly safeguarded while, at the same time, protecting privacy concerns. Prevention\n\n and investigation of crime and protection of the revenue are among the legitimate\n\n aims of the state. Digital platforms are a vital tool of ensuring good governance in a\n\n social welfare state. Information technology – legitimately deployed is a powerful\n\n enabler in the spread of innovation and knowledge.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_220\">\n\n 182       A distinction has been made in contemporary literature between anonymity on\n\n one hand and privacy on the other.402 Both anonymity and privacy prevent others from\n\n gaining access to pieces of personal information yet they do so in opposite ways.\n\n Privacy involves hiding information whereas anonymity involves hiding what makes it\n\n personal. An unauthorised parting of the medical records of an individual which have\n\n been furnished to a hospital will amount to an invasion of privacy. On the other hand,\n\n the state may assert a legitimate interest in analysing data borne from hospital records\n\n to understand and deal with a public health epidemic such as malaria or dengue to\n\n obviate a serious impact on the population. If the State preserves the anonymity of the\n\n individual it could legitimately assert a valid state interest in the preservation of public\n\n health to design appropriate policy interventions on the basis of the data available to\n\n it.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_221\">\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_782\">402</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_222\">      See in this connection, Jeffrey M.

Any curtailment or\n\ndeprivation of that right would have to take place under a regime of law. The procedure\n\nestablished by law must be fair, just and reasonable.

The Expert Group in its Report403\n\n(dated 16 October 2012) proposed a framework for the protection of privacy concerns\n\nwhich, it was expected, would serve as a conceptual foundation for legislation\n\nprotecting privacy.

The judgment\n\n  does not specifically adjudicate on whether a right to privacy would arise from any\n\n  of the other provisions of the rights guaranteed by Part III including <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_680\">Article 21</a> and\n\n  <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_681\">Article 19.</a> The observation that privacy is not a right guaranteed by the Indian\n\n  Constitution is not reflective of the correct position. M P Sharma is overruled to the\n\n  extent to which it indicates to the contrary.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_233\">\n\n\n2 Kharak Singh has correctly held that the content of the expression ‘life’ under\n\n   <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_682\">Article 21</a> means not merely the right to a person’s “animal existence” and that the\n\n   expression ‘personal liberty’ is a guarantee against invasion into the sanctity of a\n\n   person’s home or an intrusion into personal security. Kharak Singh also correctly\n\n   laid down that the dignity of the individual must lend content to the meaning of\n\n   ‘personal liberty’. The first part of the decision in Kharak Singh which invalidated\n\n   domiciliary visits at night on the ground that they violated ordered liberty is an\n\n   implicit recognition of the right to privacy. The second part of the decision,\n\n   however, which holds that the right to privacy is not a guaranteed right under our\n\n   Constitution, is not reflective of the correct position. Similarly, Kharak Singh’s\n\n   reliance upon the decision of the majority in Gopalan is not reflective of the correct\n\n   position in view of the decisions in Cooper and in Maneka. Kharak Singh to the\n\n   extent that it holds that the right to privacy is not protected under the Indian\n\n   Constitution is overruled.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_234\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_789\">                                           261</span>\n\f                                                                                  PART T\n\n\n3 (A) Life and personal liberty are inalienable rights. These are rights which are\n\n   inseparable from a dignified human existence.        The dignity of the individual,\n\n   equality between human beings and the quest for liberty are the foundational pillars\n\n   of the Indian Constitution;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_235\">\n\n(B) Life and personal liberty are not creations of the Constitution. These rights are\n\n   recognised by the Constitution as inhering in each individual as an intrinsic and\n\n   inseparable part of the human element which dwells within;\n\n\n(C) Privacy is a constitutionally protected right which emerges primarily from the\n\n   guarantee of life and personal liberty in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_683\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. Elements of\n\n   privacy also arise in varying contexts from the other facets of freedom and dignity\n\n   recognised and guaranteed by the fundamental rights contained in Part III;\n\n\n(D) Judicial recognition of the existence of a constitutional right of privacy is not an\n\n   exercise in the nature of amending the Constitution nor is the Court embarking on\n\n   a constitutional function of that nature which is entrusted to Parliament;\n\n\n(E) Privacy is the constitutional core of human dignity. Privacy has both a normative\n\n   and descriptive function. At a normative level privacy sub-serves those eternal\n\n   values upon which the guarantees of life, liberty and freedom are founded. At a\n\n   descriptive level, privacy postulates a bundle of entitlements and interests which\n\n   lie at the foundation of ordered liberty;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_236\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_790\">                                           262</span>\n\f                                                                                   PART T\n\n\n(F) Privacy includes at its core the preservation of personal intimacies, the sanctity of\n\n   family life, marriage, procreation, the home and sexual orientation. Privacy also\n\n   connotes a right to be left alone. Privacy safeguards individual autonomy and\n\n   recognises the ability of the individual to control vital aspects of his or her life.\n\n   Personal choices governing a way of life are intrinsic to privacy. Privacy protects\n\n   heterogeneity and recognises the plurality and diversity of our culture. While the\n\n   legitimate expectation of privacy may vary from the intimate zone to the private\n\n   zone and from the private to the public arenas, it is important to underscore that\n\n   privacy is not lost or surrendered merely because the individual is in a public place.\n\n   Privacy attaches to the person since it is an essential facet of the dignity of the\n\n   human being;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_237\">\n(G) This Court has not embarked upon an exhaustive enumeration or a catalogue of\n\n    entitlements or interests comprised in the right to privacy. The Constitution must\n\n    evolve with the felt necessities of time to meet the challenges thrown up in a\n\n    democratic order governed by the rule of law. The meaning of the Constitution\n\n    cannot be frozen on the perspectives present when it was adopted. Technological\n\n    change has given rise to concerns which were not present seven decades ago\n\n    and the rapid growth of technology may render obsolescent many notions of the\n\n    present. Hence the interpretation of the Constitution must be resilient and flexible\n\n    to allow future generations to adapt its content bearing in mind its basic or\n\n    essential features;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_238\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_791\">                                          263</span>\n\f                                                                                     PART T\n\n\n(H) Like other rights which form part of the fundamental freedoms protected by Part\n\n   III, including the right to life and personal liberty under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_684\">Article 21</a>, privacy is not an\n\n   absolute right. A law which encroaches upon privacy will have to withstand the\n\n   touchstone of permissible restrictions on fundamental rights. In the context of\n\n   <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_685\">Article 21</a> an invasion of privacy must be justified on the basis of a law which\n\n   stipulates a procedure which is fair, just and reasonable. The law must also be\n\n   valid with reference to the encroachment on life and personal liberty under Article\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_239\">   21. An invasion of life or personal liberty must meet the three-fold requirement of\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_240\">   (i) legality, which postulates the existence of law; (ii) need, defined in terms of a\n\n   legitimate state aim; and (iii) proportionality which ensures a rational nexus\n\n   between the objects and the means adopted to achieve them; and\n\n\n(I) Privacy has both positive and negative content. The negative content restrains the\n\n   state from committing an intrusion upon the life and personal liberty of a citizen. Its\n\n   positive content imposes an obligation on the state to take all necessary measures\n\n   to protect the privacy of the individual.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_241\">\n4 Decisions rendered by this Court subsequent to Kharak Singh, upholding the right\n\n   to privacy would be read subject to the above principles.\n\n\n5 Informational privacy is a facet of the right to privacy. The dangers to privacy in\n\n   an age of information can originate not only from the state but from non-state actors\n\n   as well. We commend to the Union Government the need to examine and put into\n\n   place a robust regime for data protection. The creation of such a regime requires\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_792\">                                            264</span>\n\f                                                                                           PART T\n\n\n   a careful and sensitive balance between individual interests and legitimate\n\n   concerns of the state. The legitimate aims of the state would include for instance\n\n   protecting national security, preventing and investigating crime, encouraging\n\n   innovation and the spread of knowledge, and preventing the dissipation of social\n\n   welfare benefits.

Sharma was – whether seizure of documents from\n\nthe custody of a person accused of an offence would amount to\n\n“testimonial compulsion” prohibited under <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_687\">Article 20(3)</a> of our\n\nConstitution?</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_254\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_255\">5.       The rule against the “testimonial compulsion” is contained in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_688\">Article 20(3)2</a> of our Constitution.                                 The expression “testimonial\n\ncompulsion” is not found in that provision. The mandate contained\n\nin <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_689\">Article 20(3)</a> came to be described as the rule against testimonial\n\ncompulsion. The rule against self-incrimination owes its origin to\n\nthe revulsion against the inquisitorial methods adopted by the Star\n\nChamber of England3 and the same was incorporated in the Fifth\n\nAmendment of the American Constitution.4\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_799\">2</span>\n  “Article 20(3) of the Constitution of India: “No person accused of any offence shall be compelled to be a witness\nagainst himself.”\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_800\">3</span>\n   “In English law, this principle of protection against self-incrimination had a historical origin. It resulted from a\nfeeling of revulsion against the inquisitorial methods adopted and the barbarous sentences imposed, by the Court of\nStar Chamber, in the exercise of its criminal jurisdiction. This came to a head in the case of John Lilburn, 3 State\nTrials 1315, which brought about the abolition of the Star Chamber and the firm recognition of the principle that the\naccused should not be put on oath and that no evidence should be taken from him. This principle, in course of time,\ndeveloped into its logical extensions, by way of privilege of witnesses against self-incrimination, when called for\ngiving oral testimony or for production of documents. A change was introduced by the Criminal Evidence Act of\n1898 by making an accused a competent witness on his own behalf, if he applied for it. But so far as the oral\ntestimony of witnesses and the production of documents are concerned, the protection against self-incrimination\ncontinued as before. (See Phipson on Evidence, 9th Edition, pages 215 and 474).\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_256\">     These principles, as they were before the statutory change in 1898, were carried into the American legal system\nand became part of its common law.

Does the rule against “testimonial compulsion”, entrenched as\n\na fundamental right under our Constitution create a right of\n\nprivacy? - is a question not examined in M.P. Sharma.                                                 It was\n\nargued in M.P. Sharma “that a search to obtain documents for investigation\n\ninto an offence is a compulsory procuring of incriminatory evidence from the\n\naccused himself and is, therefore, hit by <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_690\">Article 20(3)</a> …” by necessary\n\nimplication flowing from “certain canons of liberal construction”.                               Originally\n\nthe rule was invoked only against oral evidence.                                    But the judgment\n\nin Boyd v.

I see no warrant for a conclusion (which is absolute) that their\n\nlordships held that there is no right of privacy under our\n\nConstitution. All that, in my opinion, their Lordships meant to say\n\nwas that contents of the U.S. Fourth Amendment cannot be\n\nimported into our Constitution, while interpreting <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_693\">Article 20(3).</a>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_264\">That is the boundary of M.P. Singh’s ratio. Such a conclusion, in\n\nmy opinion, requires a further examination in an appropriate\n\ncase since it is now too well settled that the text                   of       the\n\nConstitution is only the primary source for understanding the\n\nConstitution and the silences of the Constitution are also to\n\nbe ascertained to understand the Constitution.

Therefore, values other than\n\nthose informing the Fourth Amendment can ground a right of\n\nprivacy if such values are a part of the Indian Constitutional\n\nframework, and M.P.

The question whether a\n\nfundamental right of privacy is implied from these Articles, is\n\ntherefore, res integra and M.P. Sharma is no authority on that\n\naspect.

The majority took note of the American decision\n\nin Wolf v. Colorado, 338 US 25 wherein it was held that State lacks\n\nthe authority to sanction “incursion into privacy” of citizens.      Such a\n\npower would run counter to the guarantee of the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment8 and against the “very essence of a scheme of ordered liberty”.9 The\n\nmajority judgment in Kharak Singh noticed that the conclusion\n\nrecorded in Wolf v. Colorado is based on the prohibition contained\n\nin the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, and a\n\ncorresponding provision is absent in our Constitution.

The principle <a href=\"/doc/257876/\" id=\"a_723\">laid down by</a> this\n\nCourt in Kesvananda20, that the basic structure of the Constitution\n\ncannot be abrogated is the most outstanding and brilliant\n\nexposition of the ‘dark matter’ and is a part of our Constitution,\n\nthough there is nothing in the text suggesting that principle.

The text and the intent of the original framers are determinative under the textualist approach. The living\nconstitutionalist approach, while acknowledging the importance of the text, takes into account a variety of factors as\naids to interpret the text. Depending on the nature of factor used, academics have added further nuance to the this\napproach of interpretation (For instance, in his book titled ‘Constitutional Interpretation’ (which builds on his earlier\nwork titled ‘Constitutional Fate’), Philip Bobbitt categorizes the six approaches to interpretation of Constitutions as\nhistorical, textual, prudential, doctrinal, structural, and ethical. The latter four approaches treat the text as less\ndeterminative than the former two approaches).</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_288\">This court has progressively adopted a living constitutionalist approach. Varyingly, it has interpreted the\nConstitutional text by reference to Constitutional values (liberal democratic ideals which form the bedrock on which\nour text sits); a mix of cultural, social, political and historical ethos which surround our Constitutional text; a\nstructuralist technique typified by looking at the structural divisions of power within the Constitution and\ninterpreting it as an integrated whole etc. This court need not, in the abstract, fit a particular interpretative technique\nwithin specific pigeonholes of a living constitutionalist interpretation. Depending on which particular source is most\nuseful and what the matter at hand warrants, the court can resort to variants of a living constitutionalist\ninterpretation. This lack of rigidity allows for an enduring constitution.\n\nThe important criticisms against the living constitutionalist approach are that of uncertainty and that it can lead to\narbitrary exercise of judicial power. The living constitutionalist approach in my view is preferable despite these\ncriticisms, for two reasons. First, adaptability cannot be equated to lack of discipline in judicial reasoning. Second, it\nis still the text of the constitution which acquires the requisite interpretative hues and therefore, it is not as if there is\nviolence being perpetrated upon the text if one resorts to the living constitutionalist approach.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_834\">20</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_289\">     His Holiness Kesavananda Bharati Sripadagalvaru &amp; Others. v.

The very purpose of creating a\n\nwritten Constitution is to secure justice, liberty and equality to the\n\npeople of India.

The majority of\nthe Judges took the view &quot;that personal liberty&#x27; is used in the article as a compendious term to include within itself\nall the varieties of rights which go to make up the ‘personal liberties&#x27; of man other than those dealt with in the\nseveral clauses of <a href=\"/doc/1142233/\" id=\"a_755\">Article 19(1).</a> In other words, while <a href=\"/doc/1142233/\" id=\"a_756\">Article 19(1)</a> deals with particular species or attributes of that\nfreedom, &#x27;personal liberty&#x27; in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_757\">Article 21</a> takes in and comprises the residue&quot;. The minority judges, however,\ndisagreed with this view taken by the majority and explained their position in the following words : &quot;No doubt the\nexpression &#x27;personal liberty&#x27; is a comprehensive one and the right to move freely is an attribute of personal liberty. It\nis said that the freedom to move freely is carved out of personal liberty and, therefore, the expression &#x27;personal\nliberty&#x27; in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_758\">Article 21</a> excludes that attribute. In our view, this is not a correct approach. Both are independent\nfundamental rights, though there is overlapping. There is no question of one being carved out of another. The\nfundamental right of life and personal liberty has many attributes and some of them are found in <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_759\">Article 19.</a> If a\nperson&#x27;s fundamental right under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_760\">Article 21</a> is infringed, the State can rely upon a law to sustain the action, but that\ncannot be a complete answer unless the said law satisfies the test <a href=\"/doc/619152/\" id=\"a_761\">laid down in</a> <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_762\">Article 19(2)</a> so far as the attributes\ncovered by <a href=\"/doc/1142233/\" id=\"a_763\">Article 19(1)</a> are concerned&quot;.

The question now arises as to what is the purpose the framers\n\nof the Constitution sought to achieve by specifically enumerating\n\nsome of the freedoms which otherwise would form part of the\n\nexpression ‘liberty’.

The need for such an emphatic declaration\n\narose from the history of this nation. In my opinion, the purpose\n\nsought to be achieved is two-fold. Firstly, to place the expression\n\n‘liberty’ beyond the argumentative process45 of ascertaining the\n\nmeaning of the expression liberty, and secondly, to restrict the\n\nauthority of the State to abridge those enumerated freedoms only to\n\nachieve the purposes indicated in the corresponding clauses (2) to\n\n(6) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_791\">Article 19.46</a> It must be remembered that the authority of the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_894\">45</span>\n  That was exactly the State’s submission in A.K.

One of the earliest cases where the constitutionality of State’s\n\naction allegedly infringing the right of privacy fell for the\n\nconsideration of the US Supreme Court is Griswold et al v.\n\nConnecticut, 381 US 479. The Supreme Court of the United States\n\nsustained a claim of a privacy interest on the theory that the\n\nConstitution itself creates certain zones of privacy - ‘repose’ and\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_911\">                                                                            34</span>\n\f‘intimate       decision.52         Building         on this         framework,           Bostwick53\n\nsuggested that there are in fact, three aspects of privacy – “repose”,\n\n“sanctuary” and “intimate decision”. “Repose” refers to freedom\n\nfrom unwarranted stimuli, “sanctuary” to protection against\n\nintrusive observation, and “intimate decision” to autonomy with\n\nrespect to the most personal life choices. Whether any other facet\n\nof the right of privacy exists cannot be divined now. In my opinion,\n\nthere is no need to resolve all definitional concerns at an abstract\n\nlevel to understand the nature of the right to privacy. The ever\n\ngrowing possibilities of technological and psychological intrusions\n\nby the State into the liberty of SUBJECTS must leave some doubt in\n\nthis context. Definitional uncertainty is no reason to not recognize\n\nthe existence of the right of privacy. For the purpose of this case, it\n\nis sufficient to go by the understanding that the right to privacy\n\nconsists of three facets i.e. repose, sanctuary and intimate decision.\n\nEach of these facets is so essential for the liberty of human beings\n\nthat I see no reason to doubt that the right to privacy is part of the\n\nliberty guaranteed by our Constitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_345\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_912\">52</span>\n Griswold v Connecticut 381 US 479 (1965) 487.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_913\">53</span><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_346\">\n  Gary Bostwick, ‘A Taxonomy of Privacy: Repose, Sanctuary, and Intimate Decision’ (1976) 64 California Law\nReview 1447.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_914\">                                                                                                       35</span><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_347\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_348\">\f37.

The limitations are to be identified on case to case\n\nbasis depending upon the nature of the privacy interest claimed.\n\nThere are different standards of review to test infractions of\n\nfundamental rights.

As a term, compelling state interest does not have\n\ndefinite contours in the US.

It arises in the context of a constitutional challenge to the\n\n\nAadhaar project, which aims to build a database of personal identity and\n\n\nbiometric information covering every Indian – the world’s largest\n\n\nendeavour of its kind. To the Petitioners’ argument therein that Aadhaar\n\n\nwould violate the right to privacy, the Union of India, through its\n\n\nAttorney General, raised the objection that Indians could claim no\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_945\">                                  2</span>\n\f       constitutional right of privacy in view of a unanimous decision of 8\n\n\n       Judges of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/1306519/\" id=\"a_839\">M.P.

What is at stake is\n                      the amplitude of the fundamental rights including\n                      that precious and inalienable right under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_841\">Article 21.</a>\n                      If the observations made in MP Sharma and Kharak\n                      Singh are to be read literally and accepted as the law\n                      of this country, the fundamental rights guaranteed\n                      under the Constitution of India and more particularly\n                      right to liberty under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_842\">Article 21</a> would be denuded of\n                      vigour and vitality.

The question of whether <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_844\">Article 21</a> encompasses a fundamental\n\n\nright to privacy did not fall for consideration before the 8 Judges in the\n\n\nM.P. Sharma Court.      Rather, the question was whether an improper\n\n\nsearch and seizure operation undertaken against a company and its\n\n\ndirectors would violate the constitutional bar against testimonial\n\n\ncompulsion contained in <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_845\">Article 20(3)</a> of the Constitution. This Court\n\n\nheld that such a search did not violate <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_846\">Article 20(3).</a>      Its reasoning\n\n\nproceeded on the footing that the absence of a fundamental right to\n\n\nprivacy analogous to the Fourth Amendment to the United States’\n\n\nconstitution in our own constitution suggested that the Constituent\n\n\nAssembly chose not to subject laws providing for search and seizure to\n\n\nconstitutional limitations. Consequently, this Court had no defensible\n\n\nground on which to import such a right into <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_847\">Article 20(3)</a>, which was, at\n\n\nany event, a totally different right.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_386\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_387\">5.     M.P. Sharma is unconvincing not only because it arrived at its\n\n\nconclusion without enquiry into whether a privacy right could exist in\n\n\nour Constitution on an independent footing or not, but because it\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_952\">                                    5</span>\n\f       wrongly took the United States Fourth Amendment – which in itself is no\n\n\n       more than a limited protection against unlawful surveillance – to be a\n\n\n       comprehensive constitutional guarantee of privacy in that jurisdiction.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_388\">       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"619152\" id=\"span_953\">6.      Neither does the 4:2 majority in <a href=\"/doc/619152/\" id=\"a_848\">Kharak Singh v. State of Uttar\n\n\n       Pradesh</a> (supra) furnish a basis for the proposition that no constitutional\n\n\n       right to privacy exists. Ayyangar, J.’s opinion for the majority found that\n\n\n       Regulation 236 (b) of the Uttar Pradesh Police Regulations, which inter\n\n\n       alia enabled the police to make domiciliary visits at night was “plainly\n\n\n       violative of Article 21”4. In reasoning towards this conclusion, the Court\n\n\n       impliedly acknowledged a constitutional right to privacy. In particular, it\n\n\n       began by finding that though India has no like guarantee to the Fourth\n\n\n       Amendment, “an unauthorised intrusion into a person’s home and the\n\n\n       disturbance caused to him thereby, is as it were the violation of a\n\n\n       common law right of a man – an ultimate essential of ordered liberty, if\n\n\n       not of the very concept of civilization”5. It proceeded to affirm that the\n\n\n       statement in Semayne’s case6 that “the house of everyone is to him as\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_954\">4</span>\n    Id., at p. 350\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_955\">5</span>\n    Id., at p. 349\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_956\">6</span>\n    (1604) 5 Coke 91\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_957\">                                         6</span>\n\f     his castle and fortress as well as for his defence against injury and\n\n\n     violence as for his repose” articulated an “abiding principle which\n\n\n     transcends mere protection of property rights and expounds a concept\n\n\n     of “personal liberty.” Thus far, the Kharak Singh majority makes out the\n\n\n     case of the Attorney General. But, in its final conclusion, striking down\n\n\n     Regulation 236 (b) being violative of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_849\">Article 21</a> could not have been\n\n\n     arrived at without allowing that a right of privacy was covered by that\n\n\n     guarantee.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_389\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_390\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1766147\" id=\"span_958\">7.      The M.P. Sharma Court did not have the benefit of two\n\n\n     interpretative devices that have subsequently become indispensable\n\n\n     tools in this Court’s approach to adjudicating constitutional cases. The\n\n\n     first of these devices derives from R.C. Cooper v. Union of India7 and its\n\n\n     progeny – including <a href=\"/doc/1766147/\" id=\"a_850\">Maneka Gandhi v.

M.P.     Sharma   also   predates   the   practice   of   the   judicial\n\n\n       enumeration of rights implicit in a guarantee instantiated in the\n\n\n       constitutional text. As counsel for the Petitioners correctly submitted,\n\n\n       there is a whole host of rights that this court has derived from <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_852\">Article 21</a>\n\n\n       to evidence that enumeration is a well-embedded interpretative practice\n\n\n       in constitutional law. Article 21’s guarantee to the right to ‘life’ is home\n\n\n       to such varied rights as the right to go abroad (<a href=\"/doc/1766147/\" id=\"a_853\">Maneka Gandhi v.

Therefore, nothing in M.P. Sharma and Kharak Singh supports\n\n\n       the conclusion that there is no fundamental right to privacy in our\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_967\">10</span>\n     (1985) 3 SCC 545\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_968\">11</span>\n     (1989) 4 SCC 286\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_969\">                                           8</span>\n\f       Constitution. These two decisions and their inconclusiveness on the\n\n\n       question before the Court today have been discussed in great detail in\n\n\n       the opinions of Chelameswar J., Nariman J., and Chandrachud J.,\n\n\n       I agree with their conclusion in this regard. To the extent that stray\n\n\n       observations taken out of their context may suggest otherwise, the shift\n\n\n       in our understanding of the nature and location of various fundamental\n\n\n       rights in Part III brought about by R.C.

It was argued for the Union by Mr. K.K.

This\n\n\n        submission is difficult to accept. In order to properly appreciate the\n\n\n        argument, an exposition of the first principles concerning the nature and\n\n\n        evolution of rights is necessary.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_399\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_400\">        12.     According to Salmond, rights are interests protected by ‘rules of\n\n\n        right’, i.e., by moral or legal rules13. When interests are worth\n\n\n        protecting on moral grounds, irrespective of the existence of a legal\n\n\n        system or the operation of law, they are given the name of a natural\n\n\n        right. Accordingly, Roscoe Pound refers to natural law as a theory of\n\n\n        moral qualities inherent in human beings, and to natural rights as\n\n\n        deductions demonstrated by reason from human nature14.             He defines\n\n\n        natural rights, and distinguishes them from legal rights (whether at\n\n\n        common law or under constitutions) in the following way:\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_457\">                       “Natural rights mean simply interests which we think\n                       ought to be secured demands which human beings\n                       may make which we think ought to be satisfied. It is\n                       perfectly true that neither law nor state creates\n                       them. But it is fatal to all sound thinking to treat\n                       them as legal conceptions. For legal rights, the\n                       devices which law employs to secure such of these\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_973\">13</span>\n     PJ FITZGERALD, SALMOND ON JURISPRUDENCE 217 (Twelfth Edition, 1966)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_974\">14</span>\n     ROSCOE POUND, THE SPIRIT OF THE COMMON LAW 88 (1921)\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_975\">                                               10</span>\n\f                          interests as it is expedient to recognize, are the work\n                          of the law and in that sense the work of the state.”15\n\n\n\n       Privacy, with which we are here concerned, eminently qualifies as an\n\n\n       inalienable natural right, intimately connected to two values whose\n\n\n       protection is a matter of universal moral agreement: the innate dignity\n\n\n       and autonomy of man.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_401\">       13.           Legal systems,   which in India as      in England,    began as\n\n\n       monarchies, concentrated the power of the government in the person of\n\n\n       the king. English common law, whether it is expressed in the laws of the\n\n\n       monarch and her Parliament, or in the decisions of the Courts, is the\n\n\n       source of what the Attorney General correctly takes to be our own\n\n\n       common law. Semayne’s case16, in which it was affirmed that a man’s\n\n\n       home is his castle and that even the law may only enter it with warrant,\n\n\n       clearly shows that elements of the natural right of privacy began to be\n\n\n       received into the common law as early as in 1604. Where a natural law\n\n\n       right could not have been enforced at law, the common law right is\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_976\">15</span>\n     Id., at p. 92\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_977\">16</span>\n     (1604) 5 Coke 91\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_978\">                                              11</span>\n\f     evidently an instrument by which invasions into the valued interest in\n\n\n     question by one’s fellow man can be addressed. On the very same\n\n\n     rationale as Seymayne, Chapter 17 of the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_857\">Indian Penal Code</a>, 1860,\n\n\n     treats trespass against property as a criminal offence17.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_402\">     14.     With the advent of democracy and of limited constitutional\n\n\n     government came the state, a new actor with an unprecedented capacity\n\n\n     to interfere with natural and common law rights alike. The state differs in\n\n\n     two material ways from the monarch, the previous site in which\n\n\n     governmental power (including the power to compel compliance through\n\n\n     penal laws) was vested.

But this is not to suggest that solitude is always essential to\n\n\n       privacy. It is in this sense of an individual’s liberty to do things privately\n\n\n       that a group of individuals, however large, is entitled to seclude itself\n\n\n       from others and be private. In fact, a conglomeration of individuals in a\n\n\n       space to which the rights of admission are reserved – as in a hotel or a\n\n\n       cinema hall –must be regarded as private. Nor is the right to privacy lost\n\n\n       when a person moves about in public. The law requires a specific\n\n\n       authorization for search of a person even where there is suspicion26.\n\n\n       Privacy must also mean the effective guarantee of a zone of internal\n\n\n       freedom in which to think. The disconcerting effect of having another\n\n\n       peer over one’s shoulder while reading or writing explains why\n\n\n       individuals would choose to retain their privacy even in public.

Even in the ancient and religious texts of India, a well-developed\n\n\n       sense of privacy is evident. A woman ought not to be seen by a male\n\n\n       stranger seems to be a well-established rule in the Ramayana. Grihya\n\n\n       Sutras prescribe the manner in which one ought to build one’s house in\n\n\n       order to protect the privacy of its inmates and preserve its sanctity\n\n\n       during the performance of religious rites, or when studying the Vedas or\n\n\n       taking meals. The Arthashastra prohibits entry into another’s house,\n\n\n       without the owner’s consent27. There is still a denomination known as\n\n\n       the Ramanuj Sampradaya in southern India, members of which continue\n\n\n       to observe the practice of not eating and drinking in the presence of\n\n\n       anyone else. Similarly in Islam, peeping into others’ houses is strictly\n\n\n       prohibited28.    Just as the United States Fourth Amendment guarantees\n\n\n       privacy in one’s papers and personal effects, the Hadith makes it\n\n\n       reprehensible to read correspondence between others. In Christianity,\n\n\n       we find the aspiration to live without interfering in the affairs of others in\n\n\n       the text of the Bible29. Confession of one’s sins is a private act30.\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1002\">27</span>\n     KAUTILYA’S ARTHASHASTRA189-90 (R.

Privacy, that is to say, the condition arrived at after excluding\n\n\n      other persons, is a basic pre-requisite for exercising the liberty and the\n\n\n      freedom to perform that activity.

It is not possible to truncate or isolate the basic freedom to do\n\n\n      an activity in seclusion from the freedom to do the activity itself. The\n\n\n      right to claim a basic condition like privacy in which guaranteed\n\n\n      fundamental rights can be exercised must itself be regarded as a\n\n\n      fundamental right. Privacy, thus, constitutes the basic, irreducible\n\n\n      condition necessary for the exercise of ‘personal liberty’ and freedoms\n\n\n      guaranteed by the Constitution.

Undoubtedly, privacy exists, as the foregoing demonstrates, as a\n\n\nverifiable fact in all civilized societies. But privacy does not stop at being\n\n\nmerely a descriptive claim. It also embodies a normative one. The\n\n\nnormative case for privacy is intuitively simple.

The liberty of expressing\n              and publishing opinions may seem to fall under a\n              different principle, since it belongs to that part of the\n              conduct of an individual which concerns other\n              people; but, being almost of as much importance as\n              the liberty of thought itself, and resting in great part\n              on the same reasons, is practically inseparable from\n              it. Secondly, the principle requires liberty of\n              tastes and pursuits; of framing the plan of our\n              life to suit our own character; of doing as we like,\n              subject to such consequences as may follow: without\n              impediment from our fellow-creatures, so long as\n              what we do does not harm them, even though they\n              should think our conduct foolish, perverse, or wrong.\n              Thirdly, from this liberty of each individual, follows\n              the liberty, within the same limits, of combination\n              among individuals; freedom to unite, for any purpose\n              not involving harm to others: the persons combining\n              being supposed to be of full age, and not forced or\n              deceived.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_470\">              No society in which these liberties are not, on\n              the whole, respected, is free, whatever may be\n              its form of government; and none is completely\n              free in which they do not exist absolute and\n              unqualified.

The first and natural home for a right of privacy is in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_876\">Article 21</a>\n\n\n     at the very heart of ‘personal liberty’ and life itself. Liberty and privacy\n\n\n     are integrally connected in a way that privacy is often the basic condition\n\n\n     necessary for exercise of the right of personal liberty. There are\n\n\n     innumerable activities which are virtually incapable of being performed at\n\n\n     all and in many cases with dignity unless an individual is left alone or is\n\n\n     otherwise empowered to ensure his or her privacy. Birth and death are\n\n\n     events when privacy is required for ensuring dignity amongst all civilized\n\n\n     people. Privacy is thus one of those rights “instrumentally required if one\n\n\n     is to enjoy”33 rights specified and enumerated in the constitutional text.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1011\">32</span>\n  JOHN STUART MILL, ON LIBERTY AND OTHER ESSAYS 15-16 (Stefan Collini ed., 1989) (1859)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1012\">33</span>\n  Laurence H.

It is difficult to   see how dignity        – whose constitutional\n\n\nsignificance is acknowledged both by the Preamble and by this Court in\n\n\nits exposition of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_886\">Article 21</a>, among other rights – can be assured to the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1022\">                                   27</span>\n\findividual without privacy. Both dignity and privacy are intimately\n\n\nintertwined and are natural conditions for the birth and death of\n\n\nindividuals, and for many significant events in life between these events.\n\n\nNecessarily, then, the right of privacy is an integral part of both ‘life’ and\n\n\n‘personal liberty’ under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_887\">Article 21</a>, and is intended to enable the rights\n\n\nbearer to develop her potential to the fullest extent made possible only\n\n\nin consonance with the constitutional values expressed in the Preamble\n\n\nas well as across Part III.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_431\">\nPrivacy as a Travelling Right\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_432\">31.     I have already shown that the right of privacy is as inalienable as\n\n\nthe right to perform any constitutionally permissible act. Privacy in all its\n\n\naspects constitutes the springboard for the exercise of the freedoms\n\n\nguaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1142233/\" id=\"a_888\">Article 19(1).</a> Freedom of speech and expression is always\n\n\ndependent on the capacity to think, read and write in private and is often\n\n\nexercised in a state of privacy, to the exclusion of those not intended to\n\n\nbe spoken to or communicated with. A peaceful assembly requires the\n\n\nexclusion of elements who may not be peaceful or who may have a\n\n\ndifferent agenda. The freedom to associate must necessarily be the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1023\">                                   28</span>\n\ffreedom to associate with those of one’s choice and those with common\n\n\nobjectives. The requirement of privacy in matters concerning residence\n\n\nand settlement is too well-known to require elaboration. Finally, it is not\n\n\npossible to conceive of an individual being able to practice a profession\n\n\nor carry on trade, business or occupation without the right to privacy in\n\n\npractical terms and without the right and power to keep others away\n\n\nfrom his work.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_433\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_434\">32.     Ex facie, privacy is essential to the exercise of freedom of\n\n\nconscience and the right to profess, practice and propagate religion vide\n\n\n<a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_889\">Article 25.</a> The further right of every religious denomination to maintain\n\n\ninstitutions for religious and charitable purposes, to manage its own\n\n\naffairs and to own and administer property acquired for such purposes\n\n\nvide <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_890\">Article 26</a> also requires privacy, in the sense of non-interference\n\n\nfrom the state. <a href=\"/doc/630748/\" id=\"a_891\">Article 28(3)</a> expressly recognizes the right of a student\n\n\nattending an educational institution recognized by the state, to be left\n\n\nalone.

The right of privacy is also integral to the cultural and\n\n\neducational rights whereby a group having a distinct language, script or\n\n\nculture shall have the right to conserve the same.

Therefore, privacy is the necessary condition precedent to the\n\n\nenjoyment of any of the guarantees in Part III. As a result, when it is\n\n\nclaimed by rights bearers before constitutional courts, a right to privacy\n\n\nmay be situated not only in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_892\">Article 21</a>, but also simultaneously in any of\n\n\nthe other guarantees in Part III.

This is not an exhaustive list.\n\n\nFuture developments in technology and social ordering may well reveal\n\n\nthat there are yet more constitutional sites in which a privacy right\n\n\ninheres that are not at present evident to us.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_439\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1025\">                                  30</span>\n\f       Judicial Enumeration of the Fundamental Right to Privacy\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_440\">       35.      There is nothing unusual in the judicial enumeration of one right\n\n\n       on the basis of another under the Constitution. In the case of Article 21’s\n\n\n       guarantee of ‘personal liberty’, this practice is only natural if Salmond’s\n\n\n       formulation of liberty as “incipient rights”38 is correct. By the process of\n\n\n       enumeration, constitutional courts merely give a name and specify the\n\n\n       core of guarantees already present in the residue of constitutional\n\n\n       liberty. Over time, the Supreme Court has been able to imply by its\n\n\n       interpretative process, that several fundamental rights including the right\n\n\n       to privacy emerge out of expressly stated Fundamental Rights. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1775396\" id=\"span_1026\">In <a href=\"/doc/1775396/\" id=\"a_898\">Unni\n\n\n       Krishnan, J.P. v.

Not recognizing character of privacy as a fundamental right is\n\n\nlikely to erode the very sub-stratum of the personal liberty guaranteed\n\n\nby the constitution. The decided cases clearly demonstrate that\n\n\nparticular fundamental rights could not have been exercised without the\n\n\nrecognition of the right of privacy as a fundamental right. Any\n\n\nderecognition or diminution in the importance of the right of privacy will\n\n\nweaken the fundamental rights which have been expressly conferred.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_457\">37.     Before proceeding to the question of how constitutional courts\n\n\nare to review whether a violation of privacy is unconstitutional, three\n\n\narguments from the Union and the states deserve to be dealt with\n\n\nexpressly.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_458\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_459\">38.     The Learned Attorney General relied on cases holding that there\n\n\nis no fundamental right to trade in liquor to submit by analogy that there\n\n\ncan be no absolute right to privacy. Apprehensions that the recognition\n\n\nof privacy would create complications for the state in its exercise of\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1041\">                                  33</span>\n\fpowers is not well-founded. The declaration of a right cannot be avoided\n\n\nwhere there is good constitutional ground for doing so. It is only after\n\n\nacknowledging that the right of privacy is a fundamental right, that we\n\n\ncan consider how it affects the plenary powers of the state. In any event,\n\n\nthe state can always legislate a reasonable restriction to protect and\n\n\neffectuate a compelling state interest, like it may while restricting any\n\n\nother fundamental right. There is no warrant for the assumption or for\n\n\nthe conclusion that the fundamental right to privacy is an absolute right\n\n\nwhich cannot be reasonably restricted given a sufficiently compelling\n\n\nstate interest.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_460\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_461\">39.     Learned Additional Solicitor General, Shri Tushar Mehta listed\n\n\ninnumerable statutes which protect the right of privacy wherever\n\n\nnecessary and urged that it is neither necessary nor appropriate to\n\n\nrecognize privacy as a fundamental right. This argument cannot be\n\n\naccepted any more in the context of a fundamental right to privacy than\n\n\nin the context of any other fundamental right. Several legislations\n\n\nprotect and advance fundamental rights, but their existence does not\n\n\nmake the existence of a corresponding fundamental right redundant.\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1042\">                                  34</span>\n\fThis is obviously so because legislations are alterable and even\n\n\nrepealable unlike fundamental rights, which, by design, endure.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_462\">40.     Shri Rakesh Dwivedi, appearing for the State of Gujarat, while\n\n\nreferring to several judgments of the Supreme Court of the United\n\n\nStates, submitted that only those privacy claims which involve a\n\n\n‘reasonable expectation of privacy’ be recognized as protected by the\n\n\nfundamental right.   It is not necessary for the purpose of this case to\n\n\ndeal with the particular instances of privacy claims which are to be\n\n\nrecognized as implicating a fundamental right. Indeed, it would be\n\n\npremature to do. The scope and ambit of a constitutional protection of\n\n\nprivacy can only be revealed to us on a case-by-case basis.\n\n\nThe Test for Privacy\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_463\">41.     One way of determining what a core constitutional idea is, could\n\n\nbe by considering its opposite, which shows what it is not. Accordingly,\n\n\nwe understand justice as the absence of injustice, and freedom as the\n\n\nabsence of restraint. So too privacy may be understood as the antonym\n\n\nof publicity. In law, the distinction between what is considered a private\n\n\ntrust as opposed to a public trust illuminates what I take to be core and\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1043\">                                  35</span>\n\f      irreducible attributes of privacy. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"667935\" id=\"span_1044\">In <a href=\"/doc/667935/\" id=\"a_909\">Deoki Nandan v. Murlidhar42</a>, four\n\n\n      judges of this Court articulated the distinction in the following terms:</span>\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_478\">                      “The distinction between a private trust and a\n                      public trust is that whereas in the former the\n                      beneficiaries are specific individuals, in the latter\n                      they are the general public or a class thereof. While\n                      in the former the beneficiaries are persons who are\n                      ascertained or capable of being ascertained, in the\n                      latter they constitute a body which is incapable of\n                      ascertainment.”\n\n\n\n      This same feature, namely the right of a member of public as such to\n\n\n      enter upon or use such property, distinguishes private property from\n\n\n      public property and private ways from public roads.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_464\">      42.      Privacy is always connected, whether directly or through its\n\n\n      effect on the actions which are sought to be secured from interference,\n\n\n      to the act of associating with others. In this sense, privacy is usually best\n\n\n      understood as a relational right, even as its content frequently concerns\n\n\n      the exclusion of others from one’s society.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_465\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_466\">      43.      The trusts illustration also offers us a workable test for\n\n\n      determining when a constitutionally cognizable privacy claim has been\n\n\n      made, and the basis for acknowledging that the existence of such a claim\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1045\">42</span>\n     (1956) SCR 756\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1046\">                                          36</span>\n\fis context-dependent. To exercise one’s right to privacy is to choose and\n\n\nspecify on two levels. It is to choose which of the various activities that\n\n\nare taken in by the general residue of liberty available to her she would\n\n\nlike to perform, and to specify whom to include in one’s circle when\n\n\nperforming them. It is also autonomy in the negative, and takes in the\n\n\nchoice and specification of which activities not to perform and which\n\n\npersons to exclude from one’s circle. Exercising privacy is the signaling\n\n\nof one’s intent to these specified others – whether they are one’s co-\n\n\nparticipants or simply one’s audience – as well as to society at large, to\n\n\nclaim and exercise the right. To check for the existence of an actionable\n\n\nclaim to privacy, all that needs to be considered is if such an intent to\n\n\nchoose and specify exists, whether directly in its manifestation in the\n\n\nrights bearer’s actions, or otherwise.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_467\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_468\">44.     Such a formulation would exclude three recurring red herrings in\n\n\nthe Respondents’ arguments before us. Firstly, it would not admit of\n\n\narguments that privacy is limited to property or places. So, for example,\n\n\ntaking one or more persons aside to converse at a whisper even in a\n\n\npublic place would clearly signal a claim to privacy, just as broadcasting\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1047\">                                   37</span>\n\fone’s words by a loudspeaker would signal the opposite intent. Secondly,\n\n\nthis formulation would not reduce privacy to solitude. Reserving the\n\n\nrights to admission at a large gathering place, such as a cinema hall or\n\n\nclub, would signal a claim to privacy. Finally, neither would such a\n\n\nformulation require us to hold that private information must be\n\n\ninformation that is inaccessible to all others.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_469\">\nStandards of Review of Privacy Violations\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_470\">45.     There is no doubt that privacy is integral to the several\n\n\nfundamental rights recognized by Part III of the Constitution and must\n\n\nbe regarded as a fundamental right itself. The relationship between the\n\n\nright of privacy and the particular fundamental right (or rights) involved\n\n\nwould depend on the action interdicted by a particular law. At a\n\n\nminimum, since privacy is always integrated with personal liberty, the\n\n\nconstitutionality of the law which is alleged to have invaded into a rights\n\n\nbearer’s privacy must be tested by the same standards by which a law\n\n\nwhich invades personal liberty under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_910\">Article 21</a> is liable to be tested.\n\n\nUnder <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_911\">Article 21</a>, the standard test at present is the rationality review\n\n\nexpressed in Maneka Gandhi’s case. This requires that any procedure by\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1048\">                                   38</span>\n\f       which the state interferes with an <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_912\">Article 21</a> right to be “fair, just and\n\n\n       reasonable, not fanciful, oppressive or arbitrary”43.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_471\">       46.      Once it is established that privacy imbues every constitutional\n\n\n       freedom with its efficacy and that it can be located in each of them, it\n\n\n       must follow that interference with it by the state must be tested against\n\n\n       whichever one or more Part III guarantees whose enjoyment is curtailed.\n\n\n       As a result, privacy violations will usually have to answer to tests in\n\n\n       addition to the one applicable to <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_913\">Article 21.</a> Such a view would be wholly\n\n\n       consistent with R.C.

State of U.P.</a>, (1964) 1 SCR 332, which\n\nwas by a Bench of 6 learned Judges, should be overruled as\n\nthey do not reflect the correct position in law.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"43475503\" id=\"span_1059\">In any case, both\n\njudgments have been overtaken by R.C. Cooper v. Union of\n\nIndia, (<a href=\"/doc/43475503/\" id=\"a_920\">1970) 1 SCC 248, and Maneka Gandhi v. Union of\n\nIndia</a>, (1978) 1 SCC 248, and therefore require a revisit at our\n\nend. According to them, the right to privacy is very much a\n\nfundamental right which is co-terminus with the liberty and\n\ndignity of the individual. According to them, this right is found in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_921\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_922\">, 19</a><a href=\"/doc/655638/\" id=\"a_923\">, 20</a><a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_924\">, 21</a> and <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_925\">25</a> when read with the Preamble of\n\nthe Constitution. Further, it was also argued that several\n\ninternational covenants have stated that the right to privacy is\n\nfundamental to the development of the human personality and\n\nthat these international covenants need to be read into the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1060\">                                                                       5</span>\n\ffundamental rights chapter of the Constitution. Also, according\n\nto them, the right to privacy should be evolved on a case to\n\ncase basis, and being a fundamental human right should only\n\nyield to State action if such State action is compelling,\n\nnecessary and in public interest. A large number of judgments\n\nwere cited by all of them. They also invited this Court to\n\npronounce upon the fact that the right to privacy is an\n\ninalienable natural right which is not conferred by the\n\nConstitution but only recognized as such.</span>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_493\">4.   Shri Kapil Sibal, learned senior counsel on behalf of the\n\nStates of Karnataka, West Bengal, Punjab and Puducherry\n\nbroadly supported the petitioners.   According to him, the 8-\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_475\">Judge Bench and the 6-Judge Bench decisions have ceased to\n\nbe relevant in the context of the vastly changed circumstances\n\nof today.

Shri P.V. Surendra Nath, appearing on behalf of the State\n\nof Kerala, also supported the petitioners and stated that the\n\nconstitutional right to privacy very much exists in Part III of the\n\nConstitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_477\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_478\">6.    Appearing on behalf of the Union of India, Shri K.K.\n\nVenugopal, learned Attorney General for India, has argued that\n\nthe conclusions arrived at in the 8-Judge Bench and the 6-\n\nJudge Bench decisions should not be disturbed as they are\n\nsupported by the fact that the founding fathers expressly\n\nrejected the right to privacy being made part of the fundamental\n\nrights chapter of the Constitution. He referred in copious detail\n\nto the Constituent Assembly debates for this purpose. Further,\n\naccording to him, privacy is a common law right and all aspects\n\nof privacy do not elevate themselves into being a fundamental\n\nright. If at all, the right to privacy can only be one amongst\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1062\">                                                                      7</span>\n\fseveral varied rights falling under the umbrella of the right to\n\npersonal liberty. According to him, the right to life stands above\n\nthe right to personal liberty, and any claim to privacy which\n\nwould destroy or erode this basic foundational right can never\n\nbe elevated to the status of a fundamental right.        He also\n\nargued that the right to privacy cannot be claimed when most of\n\nthe aspects which are sought to be protected by such right are\n\nalready in the public domain and the information in question\n\nhas already been parted with by citizens.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_479\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_480\">7.   Shri Tushar Mehta, learned Additional Solicitor General of\n\nIndia, appearing for UIDAI and the State of Madhya Pradesh,\n\ngenerally supported and adopted the arguments of the learned\n\nAttorney General. According to him, privacy is an inherently\n\nvague and subjective concept and cannot, therefore, be\n\naccorded the status of a fundamental right. Further, codified\n\nstatutory law in India already confers protection to the\n\nindividual’s right to privacy.   According to him, no further\n\nexpansion of the rights contained in Part III of our Constitution\n\nis at all warranted. Also, the position under English Law is that\n\nthere is no common law right to privacy. He cited before us\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1063\">                                                                     8</span>\n\fexamples of other countries in the world where privacy is\n\nprotected by legislation and not by or under the Constitution.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_481\">8.     Shri Aryama Sundaram, appearing for the State of\n\nMaharashtra, also supported the arguments made by the\n\nlearned Attorney General.        According to him, there is no\n\nseparate “privacy” right and violation of a fundamental right\n\nshould directly be traceable to rights expressly protected by\n\nPart III of the Constitution. Further, privacy is a vague and\n\ninchoate expression.       He also referred to the Constituent\n\nAssembly debates to buttress the same proposition that the\n\nright to privacy was expressly discountenanced by the framers\n\nof the Constitution.    He went on to state that “personal liberty”\n\nin <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_926\">Article 21</a> is liberty which is circumscribed – i.e. it relates only\n\nto the person of the individual and is smaller conceptually than\n\n“civil liberty”.   According to him, the ratio of Kharak Singh\n\n(supra) is that there is no fundamental right to privacy, but any\n\nfundamental right that is basic to ordered liberty would certainly\n\nbe included as a fundamental right. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"377237\" id=\"span_1064\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"436241\" id=\"span_1065\">According to him, <a href=\"/doc/436241/\" id=\"a_927\">Gobind\n\nv.

Shri Rakesh Dwivedi, learned senior counsel appearing\n\nfor the State of Gujarat, has argued that both the petitioners as\n\nwell as the learned Attorney General have taken extreme\n\npositions. According to him, the petitioners state that in the\n\ncase of every invasion of a privacy right, howsoever trivial, the\n\nfundamental right to privacy gets attracted, whereas according\n\nto the learned Attorney General, there is no fundamental right\n\nto privacy at all. He asked us to adopt an intermediate position\n\n– namely, that it is only if the U.S. Supreme Court’s standard\n\nthat a petitioner before a Court satisfies the test of “reasonable\n\nexpectation of privacy” that such infraction of privacy can be\n\nelevated to the level of a fundamental right. According to Shri\n\nDwivedi, individual personal choices made by an individual are\n\nalready protected under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_929\">Article 21</a> under the rubric “personal\n\nliberty”. It is only when individuals disclose certain personal\n\ninformation in order to avail a benefit that it could be said that\n\nthey have no reasonable expectation of privacy as they have\n\nvoluntarily and freely parted with such information. Also,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1067\">                                                                     10</span>\n\faccording to him, it is only specialized data, if parted with,\n\nwhich would require protection. As an example, he stated that\n\na person’s name and mobile number, already being in the\n\npublic domain, would not be reasonably expected by that\n\nperson to be something private. On the other hand, what is\n\ncontained in that person’s bank account could perhaps be\n\nstated to be information over which he expects a reasonable\n\nexpectation of privacy and would, if divulged by the bank to\n\nothers, constitute an infraction of his fundamental right to\n\nprivacy. According to him:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_494\">     “…when a claim of privacy seeks inclusion in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_930\">Article\n     21</a> of the Constitution of India, the Court needs to\n     apply the reasonable expectation of privacy test.

The Government of India is indeed alive to the\n\nneed for such a law. He further argued that privacy as a\n\nconcept is always marshaled to protect liberty and, therefore,\n\nargued that the formulation that should be made by this Court is\n\nwhether a liberty interest is at all affected; is such liberty\n\n“personal liberty” or other liberty that deserves constitutional\n\nprotection and is there a countervailing legitimate State interest.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_496\">11.

Any discussion with regard to a right of privacy of the\n\nindividual must necessarily begin with Semayne’s case, 77 ER\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_501\">194. This case was decided in the year 1603, when there was a\n\nchange of guard in England. The Tudor dynasty ended with the\n\ndeath of Elizabeth I, and the Stuart dynasty, a dynasty which\n\nhailed from Scotland took over under James VI of Scotland,\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1072\">                                                                   14</span>\n\f        who became James I of England.1 James I was an absolute\n\n        monarch who ruled believing that he did so by Divine Right.\n\n        Semayne’s case (supra) was decided in this historical setting.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_502\">        14.      The importance of Semayne’s case (supra) is that it\n\n        decided that every man’s home is his castle and fortress for his\n\n        defence against injury and violence, as well as for his repose.\n\n        William Pitt, the Elder, put it thus: “The poorest man may in his\n\n        cottage bid defiance to all the force of the Crown. It may be frail\n\n        — its roof may shake — the wind may blow through it — the\n\n        storm may enter, the rain may enter — but the King of England\n\n        cannot enter — all his force dare not cross the threshold of the\n\n        ruined tenement.” A century and a half later, pretty much the\n\n        same thing was said in Huckle v. Money, 95 ER 768 (1763), in\n\n        which it was held that Magistrates cannot exercise arbitrary\n\n        powers which violated the Magna Carta (signed by King John,\n\n        conceding certain rights to his barons in 1215), and if they did,\n\n        exemplary damages must be given for the same. It was stated\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1073\">1</span>\n  It is interesting to note that from 1066 onwards, England has never been ruled by a native Anglo-Saxon. The\nNorman French dynasty which gave way to the Plantagenet dynasty ruled from 1066-1485; the Welsh Tudor\ndynasty then ruled from 1485-1603 AD; the Stuart dynasty, a Scottish dynasty, then ruled from 1603; and barring a\nminor hiccup in the form of Oliver Cromwell, ruled up to 1714. From 1714 onwards, members of a German dynasty\nfrom Hanover have been monarchs of England and continue to be monarchs in England.\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1074\">                                                                                                              15</span>\n\fthat, “To enter a man’s house by virtue of a nameless warrant,\n\nin order to procure evidence is worse than the Spanish\n\nInquisition, a law under which no Englishman would wish to live\n\nan hour.”\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_503\">15.   This statement of the law was echoed in Entick v.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_504\">Carrington, 95 ER 807 (1765), in which Lord Camden held that\n\nan illegal search warrant was “subversive of all the comforts of\n\nsociety” and the issuance of such a warrant for the seizure of all\n\nof a man’s papers, and not only those alleged to be criminal in\n\nnature, was “contrary to the genius of the law of England.” A\n\nfew years later, in Da Costa v. Jones, 98 ER 1331 (1778), Lord\n\nMansfield upheld the privacy of a third person when such\n\nprivacy was the subject matter of a wager, which was injurious\n\nto the reputation of such third person. The wager in that case\n\nwas as to whether a certain Chevalier D’eon was a cheat and\n\nimposter in that he was actually a woman. Such wager which\n\nviolated the privacy of a third person was held to be injurious to\n\nthe reputation of the third person for which damages were\n\nawarded to the third person. These early judgments did much\n\nto uphold the inviolability of the person of a citizen.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1075\">                                                                     16</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_505\">\f16.   When we cross the Atlantic Ocean and go to the United\n\nStates, we find a very interesting article printed in the Harvard\n\nLaw Review in 1890 by Samuel D. Warren and Louis D.\n\nBrandeis [(4 Harv. L. Rev. 193)]. The opening paragraph of the\n\nsaid article is worth quoting:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_496\">      “THAT the individual shall have full protection in\n      person and in property is a principle as old as the\n      common law; but it has been found necessary from\n      time to time to define anew the exact nature and\n      extent of such protection. Political, social, and\n      economic changes entail the recognition of new\n      rights, and the common law, in its eternal youth,\n      grows to meet the demands of society. Thus, in very\n      early times, the law gave a remedy only for physical\n      interference with life and property, for trespasses vi\n      et armis. Then the “right to life” served only to\n      protect the subject from battery in its various forms;\n      liberty meant freedom from actual restraint; and the\n      right to property secured to the individual his lands\n      and his cattle. Later, there came a recognition of\n      man’s spiritual nature, of his feelings and his\n      intellect. Gradually the scope of these legal rights\n      broadened; and now the right to life has come to\n      mean the right to enjoy life,— the right to be let\n      alone; the right to liberty secures the exercise of\n      extensive civil privileges; and the term “property”\n      has grown to comprise every form of possession—\n      intangible, as well as tangible.”\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_506\">17.   This article is of great importance for the reason that it\n\nspoke of the right of the individual “to be let alone”. It stated in\n\nunmistakable terms that this right is not grounded as a property\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1076\">                                                                       17</span>\n\fright, but is grounded in having the right of an “inviolate\n\npersonality”. Limitations on this right were also discussed in\n\nsome detail, and remedies for the invasion of this right of\n\nprivacy were suggested, being an action of tort for damages in\n\nall cases and perhaps an injunction in some. The right of\n\nprivacy as expounded in this article did not explore the\n\nramifications of the said right as against State action, but only\n\nexplored invasions of this right by private persons.\n\n\nThree Great Dissents\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_507\">18.   When the Constitution of India was framed, the\n\nfundamental rights chapter consisted of rights essentially of\n\ncitizens and persons against the State. <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_936\">Article 21</a>, with which\n\nwe are directly concerned, was couched in negative form in\n\norder to interdict State action that fell afoul of its contours. This\n\nArticle, which houses two great human rights, the right to life\n\nand the right to personal liberty, was construed rather narrowly\n\nby the early Supreme Court of India. But then, there were\n\nJudges who had vision and dissented from their colleagues.\n\nThis judgment will refer to three great dissents by Justices Fazl\n\nAli, Subba Rao and Khanna.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1077\">                                                                        18</span><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_508\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_509\">\f           19.

It appears that on the 11th October,\n        1945, General McArthur directed the Japanese\n        Cabinet to initiate measures for the preparation of\n        the Japanese Constitution, but, as no progress was\n        made, it was decided in February, 1946, that the\n        problem of constitutional reform should be taken\n        over by the Government Section of the Supreme\n        Commander’s Headquarters. Subsequently the\n        Chief of this Section and the staff drafted the\n        Constitution      with   the    help   of    American\n        constitutional lawyers who were called to assist the\n        Government Section in the task. This Constitution,\n        as a learned writer has remarked, bore on almost\n        every page evidences of its essentially Western\n        origin, and this characteristic was especially evident\n        in the preamble “particularly reminiscent of the\n        American Declaration of Independence, a preamble\n        which, it has been observed, no Japanese could\n        possibly have conceived or written and which few\n        could even understand” [See Ogg and Zink’s\n        “Modern Foreign Governments”]. One of the\n        characteristics      of   the    Constitution   which\n        undoubtedly bespeaks of direct American influence\n        is to be found in a lengthy chapter, consisting of 31\n        articles, entitled “Rights and Duties of the People,”\n        which provided for the first time an effective “Bill of\n        Rights” for the Japanese people. The usual\n        safeguards have been provided there against\n        apprehension without a warrant and against arrest\n        or detention without being informed of the charges\n        or without adequate cause (<a href=\"/doc/829916/\" id=\"a_952\">articles 33</a> and <a href=\"/doc/846153/\" id=\"a_953\">34</a>).\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1083\">                                                                  21</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_503\">\fNow there are two matters which deserve to be\nnoticed:- (1) that the Japanese Constitution was\nframed wholly under American influence; and (2)\nthat at the time it was framed the trend of judicial\nopinion in America was in favour of confining the\nmeaning of the expression “due process of law” to\nwhat is expressed by certain American writers by\nthe somewhat quaint but useful expression\n“procedural due process.” That there was such a\ntrend would be clear from the following passage\nwhich I quote from Carl Brent Swisher’s “The\nGrowth of Constitutional Power in the United States”\n(page 107):-\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_504\">     “The      American     history   of   its\n     interpretation falls into three periods.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_505\">     During the first period, covering roughly\n     the first century of government under\n     the Constitution, due process was\n     interpreted principally as a restriction\n     upon procedure—and largely the judicial\n     procedure—by which the government\n     exercised its powers. During the second\n     period, which, again roughly speaking,\n     extended through 1936, due process\n     was expanded to serve as a restriction\n     not merely upon procedure but upon the\n     substance of the activities in which the\n     government might engage. During the\n     third period, extending from 1936 to\n     date, the use of due process as a\n     substantive restriction has been largely\n     suspended or abandoned, leaving it\n     principally in its original status as a\n     restriction upon procedure.”\n\nIn the circumstances mentioned, it seems\npermissible to surmise that the expression\n“procedure established by law” as used in the\nJapanese Constitution represented the current trend\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1084\">                                                       22</span>\n\f        of American judicial opinion with regard to “due\n        process of law,” and, if that is so, the expression as\n        used in our Constitution means all that the\n        American writers have read into the words\n        “procedural due process.” But I do not wish to base\n        any conclusions upon mere surmise and will try to\n        examine the whole question on its merits.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_506\">        The word “law” may be used in an abstract or\n        concrete sense. Sometimes it is preceded by an\n        article such as “a” or “the” or by such words as\n        “any,” “all,” etc., and sometimes it is used without\n        any such prefix. But, generally, the word “law” has a\n        wider meaning when used in the abstract sense\n        without being preceded by an article. The question\n        to be decided is whether the word “law” means\n        nothing more than statute law.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_507\">        Now whatever may be the meaning of the\n        expression “due process of law,” the word “law” is\n        common to that expression as well as “procedure\n        established by law” and though we are not bound to\n        adopt the construction put on “law” or “due process\n        of law” in America, yet since a number of eminent\n        American Judges have devoted much thought to the\n        subject, I am not prepared to hold that we can\n        derive no help from their opinions and we should\n        completely ignore them.”\n                                         (at pages 159-161)\n\nHe also went on to state that “law” in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_954\">Article 21</a> means “valid\n\nlaw”.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_508\">On all counts, his words were a cry in the wilderness.

In fact,\n         you measure the reasonableness of a restriction imposed by law by indulging in an authentic bit\n         of special legislation [See Learned Hand, Bill of Rights, p. 26]. “The words ‘reason’ and\n         ‘reasonable’ denote for the common law lawyer ideas which the ‘Civilians’ and the ‘Canonists’\n         put under the head of the ‘law of nature’…”\n\n        “…The limitations in <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_1004\">Article 19</a> of the Constitution open the doors to judicial review of legislation\n        in India in much the same manner as the doctrine of police power and its companion, the due\n        process clause, have done in the United States. The restrictions that might be imposed by the\n        Legislature to ensure the public interest must be reasonable and, therefore, the Court will have\n        to apply the yardstick of reason in adjudging the reasonableness.

It is true our Constitution does not\n      expressly declare a right to privacy as a\n      fundamental right, but the said right is an essential\n      ingredient of personal liberty. Every democratic\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1105\">                                                                      29</span>\n\f      country sanctifies domestic life; it is expected to\n      give him rest, physical happiness, peace of mind\n      and security. In the last resort, a person’s house,\n      where he lives with his family, is his “castle”: it is his\n      rampart against encroachment on his personal\n      liberty. The pregnant words of that famous Judge,\n      Frankfurter J., in Wolf v. Colorado (1949) 338 U.<a href=\"/doc/1034087/\" id=\"a_1007\">S.\n      25</a>, pointing out the importance of the security of\n      one’s privacy against arbitrary intrusion by the\n      police, could have no less application to an Indian\n      home as to an American one. If physical restraints\n      on a person’s movements affect his personal liberty,\n      physical encroachments on his private life would\n      affect it in a larger degree. Indeed, nothing is more\n      deleterious to a man’s physical happiness and\n      health than a calculated interference with his\n      privacy. We would, therefore, define the right of\n      personal liberty in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1008\">Article 21</a> as a right of an\n      individual to be free from restrictions or\n      encroachments on his person, whether those\n      restrictions or encroachments are directly imposed\n      or indirectly brought about by calculated measures.\n      If so understood, all the acts of surveillance under\n      Regulation 236 infringe the fundamental right of the\n      petitioner under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1009\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution.”\n                                               (at page 359)\n\n\nThe 8 Judge Bench Decision in M.P.

This takes us to the correctness of the aforesaid view,\n\nfirstly in light of the decision of the 8-Judge Bench in M.P.\n\nSharma (supra). The facts of that case disclose that certain\n\nsearches were made as a result of which a voluminous mass of\n\nrecords was seized from various places. The petitioners prayed\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1106\">                                                                   30</span>\n\fthat the search warrants which allowed such searches and\n\nseizures to take place be quashed, based on an argument\n\nfounded on <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_1010\">Article 20(3)</a> of the Constitution which says that no\n\nperson accused of any offence shall be compelled to be a\n\nwitness against himself. The argument which was turned down\n\nby the Court was that since this kind of search would lead to the\n\ndiscovery of several incriminating documents, a person\n\naccused of an offence would be compelled to be a witness\n\nagainst himself as such documents would incriminate him. This\n\nargument was turned down with reference to the law of\n\ntestimonial compulsion in the U.S., the U.K. and in this country.\n\nWhile dealing with the argument, this Court noticed that there is\n\nnothing in our Constitution corresponding to the Fourth\n\nAmendment     of   the   U.S.   Constitution,   which   interdicts\n\nunreasonable searches and seizures. In so holding, this Court\n\nthen observed:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_527\">     “It is, therefore, clear that there is no basis in the\n     Indian law for the assumption that a search or\n     seizure of a thing or document is in itself to be\n     treated as compelled production of the same.\n     Indeed a little consideration will show that the two\n     are essentially different matters for the purpose\n     relevant to the present discussion.

But search warrant is\n      addressed to an officer of the Government,\n      generally a police officer. Neither the search nor the\n      seizure are acts of the occupier of the searched\n      premises. They are acts of another to which he is\n      obliged to submit and are, therefore, not his\n      testimonial acts in any sense.”\n\n      “A power of search and seizure is in any system of\n      jurisprudence an overriding power of the State for\n      the protection of social security and that power is\n      necessarily regulated by law. When the Constitution\n      makers have thought fit not to subject such\n      regulation to constitutional limitations by recognition\n      of a fundamental right to privacy, analogous to the\n      American Fourth Amendment, we have no\n      justification to import it, into a totally different\n      fundamental right, by some process of strained\n      construction.”\n                                       (at pages 1096-1097)\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_518\">26.   The first thing that strikes one on reading the aforesaid\n\npassage is that the Court resisted the invitation to read the U.S.\n\nFourth Amendment into the U.S. Fifth Amendment; in short it\n\nrefused to read or import the Fourth Amendment into the Indian\n\nequivalent of that part of the Fifth Amendment which is the\n\nsame as <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_1012\">Article 20(3)</a> of the Constitution of India. Also, the\n\nfundamental right to privacy, stated to be analogous to the\n\nFourth Amendment, was held to be something which could not\n\nbe read into <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_1013\">Article 20(3).</a>\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1108\">                                                                     32</span><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_519\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_520\">\f27.   The second interesting thing to be noted about these\n\nobservations is that there is no broad ratio in the said judgment\n\nthat a fundamental right to privacy is not available in Part III of\n\nthe Constitution. The observation is confined to <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_1014\">Article 20(3).</a>\n\nFurther, it is clear that the actual finding in the aforesaid case\n\nhad to do with the law which had developed in this Court as\n\nwell as the U.S. and the U.K. on <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_1015\">Article 20(3)</a> which, on the\n\nfacts of the case, was held not to be violated. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1857950\" id=\"span_1109\">Also we must not\n\nforget that this was an early judgment of the Court, delivered in\n\nthe <a href=\"/doc/1857950/\" id=\"a_1016\">Gopalan</a> (supra) era, which did not have the benefit of R.C.\n\nCooper (supra) or Maneka Gandhi (supra). Quite apart from\n\nthis, it is clear that by the time this judgment was delivered,\n\nIndia was already a signatory to the Universal Declaration of\n\nHuman Rights, <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_1017\">Article 12</a> of which states:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_528\">      “No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference\n      with his privacy, family, home or correspondence,\n      nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation.\n      Everyone has the right to the protection of the law\n      against such interference or attacks.”\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1110\">                                                                      33</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_521\">\f28.   It has always been the law of this Court that international\n\ntreaties must be respected. Our Constitution contains Directive\n\nPrinciple 51(c), which reads as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_529\">      “51. The State shall endeavour to—\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_530\">      (a) &amp; (b)   xxx   xxx   xxx\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_531\">      (c) foster respect for international law and treaty\n      obligations in the dealings of organized peoples with\n      one another;”\n      In order that legislation be effected to implement an\n\ninternational treaty, <a href=\"/doc/741672/\" id=\"a_1018\">Article 253</a> removes legislative competence\n\nfrom all the States and entrusts only the Parliament with such\n\nlegislation. <a href=\"/doc/741672/\" id=\"a_1019\">Article 253</a> reads as follows:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_532\">      “253.

At one extreme stands the\n\nUnited Kingdom, which states that international treaties are not\n\na part of the laws administered in England. At the other end of\n\nthe spectrum, Article VI of the U.S. Constitution declares:\n</blockquote>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1111\">                                                                    34</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_533\">\f      “xxx xxx    xxx\n      This Constitution, and the laws of the United States\n      which shall be made in pursuance thereof; and all\n      treaties made, or which shall be made, under the\n      authority of the United States, shall be the supreme\n      law of the land; and the judges in every state shall\n      be bound thereby, anything in the Constitution or\n      laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding.\n      xxx   xxx   xxx”\n\n      It is thus clear that no succor can be drawn from the\n\nexperience of either the U.K. or the U.S.   We must proceed in\n\naccordance with the law laid down in the judgments of the\n\nSupreme Court of India.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_522\">29.   Observations of several judgments make it clear that in\n\nthe absence of any specific prohibition in municipal law,\n\ninternational law forms part of Indian law and consequently\n\nmust be read into or as part of our fundamental rights.

They\n     are such rights which are to be made\n     available as a matter of right. The\n     Constitution and legislations of a\n     civilised country recognise them since\n     they are so quintessentially part of every\n     human being. That is why every\n     democratic country committed to the\n     rule of law put into force mechanisms for\n     their enforcement and protection.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_550\">     Human rights are universal in nature.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_551\">     The Universal Declaration of Human\n     Rights (hereinafter referred to as UDHR)\n     adopted by the General Assembly of the\n     United     Nations     on      10-12-1948\n     recognises and requires the observance\n     of certain universal rights, articulated\n     therein, to be human rights, and these\n     are acknowledged and accepted as\n     equal and inalienable and necessary for\n     the inherent dignity and development of\n     an individual. Consequently, though the\n     term “human rights” itself has not been\n     defined in UDHR, the nature and\n     content of human rights can be\n     understood from the rights enunciated\n     therein.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_552\">     Possibly considering the wide sweep of\n     such basic rights, the definition of\n     “human rights” in the 1993 Act has been\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1120\">                                                      39</span>\n\f           designedly kept           very broad        to\n           encompass within it all the rights relating\n           to life, liberty, equality and dignity of the\n           individual        guaranteed      by      the\n           Constitution or embodied in the\n           International         Covenants          and\n           enforceable by courts in India. Thus, if a\n           person has been guaranteed certain\n           rights either under the Constitution or\n           under an International Covenant or\n           under a law, and he is denied access to\n           such a right, then it amounts to a clear\n           violation of his human rights and NHRC\n           has the jurisdiction to intervene for\n           protecting it.”\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_553\">32.

It is obvious that <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1055\">Article 21</a>, though couched in\n                  negative language, confers the fundamental right to\n                  life and personal liberty. So far as the right to\n                  personal liberty is concerned, it is ensured by\n                  providing that no one shall be deprived of personal\n                  liberty except according to procedure prescribed by\n                  law. The first question that arises for consideration\n                  on the language of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1056\">Article 21</a> is: what is the\n                  meaning and content of the words ‘personal liberty’\n                  as used in this article? This question incidentally\n                  came up for discussion in some of the judgments\n                  in <a href=\"/doc/1857950/\" id=\"a_1057\">A.K. Gopalan v. State of Madras</a> (AIR 1950 SC\n                  27: 1950 SCR 88: 51 Cri LJ 1383) and the\n                  observations made by Patanjali Sastri, J.,\n                  Mukherjea, J., and S.R. Das, J., seemed to place a\n                  narrow interpretation on the words ‘personal liberty’\n                  so as to confine the protection of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1058\">Article 21</a> to\n                  freedom of the person against unlawful detention.\n                  But there was no definite pronouncement made on\n                  this point since the question before the Court was\n                  not so much the interpretation of the words\n                  ‘personal liberty’ as the inter-relation between\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1136\">7</span>\n  This view of the law is obviously incorrect. If the Preamble to the Constitution of India is to be a guide as to the\nmeaning of the expression “liberty” in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1059\">Article 21</a>, liberty of thought and expression would fall in <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_1060\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> and\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1061\">Article 21</a> and belief, faith and worship in <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_1062\">Article 25</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1063\">Article 21.</a> Obviously, “liberty” in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1064\">Article 21</a> is not confined\nto these expressions, but certainly subsumes them. It is thus clear that when <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1065\">Article 21</a> speaks of “liberty”, it is,\natleast, to be read together with <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_1066\">Articles 19(1)(a)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_1067\">25.</a></span>\n</blockquote>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1137\">                                                                                                                      45</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_568\">\f<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"619152\" id=\"span_1138\"><a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_1068\">Articles 19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1069\">21.</a> It was in <a href=\"/doc/619152/\" id=\"a_1070\">Kharak Singh v. State\nof U.P.</a> (AIR 1963 SC 1295: (1964) 1 SCR 332:</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_569\">(1963) 2 Cri LJ 329) that the question as to the\nproper scope and meaning of the expression\n‘personal liberty’ came up pointedly for\nconsideration for the first time before this Court. The\nmajority of the Judges took the view “that ‘personal\nliberty’ is used in the article as a compendious term\nto include within itself all the varieties of rights which\ngo to make up the ‘personal liberties’ of man other\nthan those dealt with in the several clauses of\n<a href=\"/doc/1142233/\" id=\"a_1071\">Article 19(1).</a> In other words, while <a href=\"/doc/1142233/\" id=\"a_1072\">Article 19(1)</a>\ndeals with particular species or attributes of that\nfreedom, ‘personal liberty’ in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1073\">Article 21</a> takes in and\ncomprises the residue”. The minority Judges,\nhowever, disagreed with this view taken by the\nmajority and explained their position in the following\nwords: “No doubt the expression ‘personal liberty’ is\na comprehensive one and the right to move freely is\nan attribute of personal liberty. It is said that the\nfreedom to move freely is carved out of personal\nliberty and, therefore, the expression ‘personal\nliberty’ in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1074\">Article 21</a> excludes that attribute. In our\nview, this is not a correct approach. Both are\nindependent fundamental rights, though there is\noverlapping. There is no question of one being\ncarved out of another. The fundamental right of life\nand personal liberty has many attributes and some\nof them are found in <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_1075\">Article 19.</a> If a person&#x27;s\nfundamental right under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1076\">Article 21</a> is infringed, the\nState can rely upon a law to sustain the action, but\nthat cannot be a complete answer unless the said\nlaw satisfies the test <a href=\"/doc/619152/\" id=\"a_1077\">laid down in</a> <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_1078\">Article 19(2)</a> so far\nas the attributes covered by <a href=\"/doc/1142233/\" id=\"a_1079\">Article 19(1)</a> are\nconcerned.” There can be no doubt that in view of\nthe decision of this Court in R.C. Cooper v. Union of\nIndia [(1970) 2 SCC 298: (1971) 1 SCR 512] the\nminority view must be regarded as correct and the\nmajority view must be held to have been overruled.”\n                                      (at pages 278-279)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1139\">                                                             46</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_531\">\f39.   The majority judgment in Kharak Singh (supra) then\n\nwent on to refer to the Preamble to the Constitution, and stated\n\nthat <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1080\">Article 21</a> contained the cherished human value of dignity\n\nof the individual as the means of ensuring his full development\n\nand evolution. A passage was then quoted from Wolf v.\n\nColorado, 338 U.<a href=\"/doc/1058907/\" id=\"a_1081\">S. 25 (1949)</a> to the effect that the security of\n\none’s privacy against arbitrary intrusion by the police is basic to\n\na free society. The Court then went on to quote the U.S. Fourth\n\nAmendment which guarantees the rights of the people to be\n\nsecured in their persons, houses, papers and effects against\n\nunreasonable searches and seizures. Though the Indian\n\nConstitution did not expressly confer a like guarantee, the\n\nmajority held that nonetheless an unauthorized intrusion into a\n\nperson’s home would violate the English Common Law maxim\n\nwhich asserts that every man’s house is his castle. In this view\n\nof <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1082\">Article 21</a>, Regulation 236(b) was struck down.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_532\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_533\">40.   However, while upholding sub-clauses (c), (d) and (e) of\n\nRegulation 236, the Court stated (at page 351):\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_534\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1140\">                                                                      47</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_570\">\f      “As already pointed out, the right of privacy is not a\n      guaranteed right under our Constitution and\n      therefore the attempt to ascertain the movements of\n      an individual which is merely a manner in which\n      privacy is invaded is not an infringement of a\n      fundamental right guaranteed by Part III.”\n\n\n      This passage is a little curious in that clause (b) relating to\n\ndomiciliary visits was struck down only on the basis of the\n\nfundamental right to privacy understood in the sense of a\n\nrestraint against the person of a citizen. It seems that the earlier\n\npassage in the judgment which stated that despite the fact that\n\nthe U.S. Fourth Amendment was not reflected in the Indian\n\nConstitution, yet any unauthorized intrusion into a person’s\n\nhome, which is nothing but a facet of the right to privacy, was\n\ngiven a go by.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_535\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"37517217\" id=\"span_1141\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1068532\" id=\"span_1142\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"382721\" id=\"span_1143\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"31276692\" id=\"span_1144\">41.   Peculiarly enough, without referring to the extracted\n\npassage in which the majority held that the right to privacy is\n\nnot a guaranteed right under our Constitution, the majority\n\njudgment has been held as recognizing a fundamental right to\n\nprivacy in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1083\">Article 21.</a> (See: <a href=\"/doc/31276692/\" id=\"a_1084\">PUCL v.

If the passage in the judgment dealing with domiciliary\n\nvisits at night and striking it down is contrasted with the later\n\npassage upholding the other clauses of Regulation 236\n\nextracted above, it becomes clear that it cannot be said with\n\nany degree of clarity that the majority judgment upholds the\n\nright to privacy as being contained in the fundamental rights\n\nchapter or otherwise.      As the majority judgment contradicts\n\nitself on this vital aspect, it would be correct to say that it cannot\n\nbe given much value as a binding precedent. In any case, we\n\nare of the view that the majority judgment is good law when it\n\nspeaks of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1088\">Article 21</a> being designed to assure the dignity of the\n\nindividual as a most cherished human value which ensures the\n\nmeans of full development and evolution of a human being.\n\nThe majority judgment is also correct in pointing out that <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1089\">Article\n\n21</a> interdicts unauthorized intrusion into a person’s home.\n\nWhere the majority judgment goes wrong is in holding that\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1146\">                                                                         49</span>\n\ffundamental rights are in watertight compartments and in\n\nholding that the right of privacy is not a guaranteed right under\n\nour Constitution. It can be seen, therefore, that the majority\n\njudgment is like the proverbial curate’s egg – good only in parts.\n\nStrangely enough when the good parts alone are seen, there is\n\nno real difference between Subba Rao, J.’s approach in the\n\ndissenting judgment and the majority judgment.           This then\n\nanswers the major part of the reference to this 9-Judge Bench\n\nin that we hereby declare that neither the 8-Judge nor the 6-\n\nJudge Bench can be read to come in the way of reading the\n\nfundamental right to privacy into Part III of the Constitution.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_538\">43.      However, the learned Attorney General has argued in\n\nsupport of the 8-Judge Bench and the 6-Judge Bench, stating\n\nthat the framers of the Constitution expressly rejected the right\n\nto privacy being made part of the fundament rights chapter of\n\nthe Constitution. While he may be right, Constituent Assembly\n\ndebates make interesting reading only to show us what exactly\n\nthe framers had in mind when they framed the Constitution of\n\nIndia.     As will be pointed out later in this judgment, our\n\njudgments expressly recognize that the Constitution governs\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1147\">                                                                     50</span>\n\fthe lives of 125 crore citizens of this country and must be\n\ninterpreted to respond to the changing needs of society at\n\ndifferent points in time.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_539\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_540\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"45326369\" id=\"span_1148\">44.   The phrase “due process” was distinctly avoided by the\n\nframers of the Constitution and replaced by the colourless\n\nexpression “procedure established by law”. Despite this, owing\n\nto changed circumstances, Maneka Gandhi (supra) in 1978,\n\nfollowed by a number of judgments, have read what was\n\nexpressly rejected by the framers into <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1090\">Article 21</a>, so that by the\n\ntime of <a href=\"/doc/45326369/\" id=\"a_1091\">Mohd. Arif</a> (supra), this Court, at paragraph 28, was\n\nable to say that the wheel has turned full circle and substantive\n\ndue process is now part and parcel of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1092\">Article 21.</a></span> Given the\n\ntechnological revolution of the later part of the 20th century and\n\nthe completely altered lives that almost every citizen of this\n\ncountry leads, thanks to this revolution, the right to privacy has\n\nto be judged in today’s context and not yesterday’s.          This\n\nargument, therefore, need not detain us.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_541\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_542\">45.   The learned Attorney General then argued that between\n\nthe right to life and the right to personal liberty, the former has\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1149\">                                                                      51</span>\n\fprimacy and any claim to privacy which would destroy or erode\n\nthis basic foundational right can never be elevated to the status\n\nof a fundamental right. Elaborating further, he stated that in a\n\ndeveloping country where millions of people are denied the\n\nbasic necessities of life and do not even have shelter, food,\n\nclothing or jobs, no claim to a right to privacy as a fundamental\n\nright would lie. First and foremost, we do not find any conflict\n\nbetween the right to life and the right to personal liberty. Both\n\nrights are natural and inalienable rights of every human being\n\nand are required in order to develop his/her personality to the\n\nfullest. Indeed, the right to life and the right to personal liberty\n\ngo hand-in-hand, with the right to personal liberty being an\n\nextension of the right to life. A large number of poor people that\n\nShri Venugopal talks about are persons who in today’s\n\ncompletely different and changed world have cell phones, and\n\nwould come forward to press the fundamental right of privacy,\n\nboth against the Government and against other private\n\nindividuals.

If the right is to be held to be not attached\nto the person, then “we would not shield our\naccount balances, income figures and personal\ntelephone and address books from the public eye,\nbut might instead go about with the information\nwritten on our ‘foreheads or our bumper stickers’.”\nHe observes that the majority in Miller, 425 US 435\n(1976), confused “privacy” with “secrecy” and that\n“even their notion of secrecy is a strange one, for\na secret remains a secret even when shared with\nthose whom one selects for one&#x27;s confidence”.

Shri Sundaram has argued that rights have to be traced\n\ndirectly to those expressly stated in the fundamental rights\n\nchapter of the Constitution for such rights to receive protection,\n\nand privacy is not one of them. It will be noticed that the dignity\n\nof the individual is a cardinal value, which is expressed in the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1157\">                                                                      57</span>\n\fPreamble to the Constitution.       Such dignity is not expressly\n\nstated as a right in the fundamental rights chapter, but has\n\nbeen read into the right to life and personal liberty. The right to\n\nlive with dignity is expressly read into <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1097\">Article 21</a> by the judgment\n\nin <a href=\"/doc/1741605/\" id=\"a_1098\">Jolly George Varghese v.

It\n\nis too late in the day to canvas that a fundamental right must be\n\ntraceable to express language in Part III of the Constitution. As\n\nwill be pointed out later in this judgment, a Constitution has to\n\nbe read in such a way that words deliver up principles that are\n\nto be followed and if this is kept in mind, it is clear that the\n\nconcept of privacy is contained not merely in personal liberty,\n\nbut also in the dignity of the individual.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_548\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_549\">49.   The judgment in Stanley v.

In this case, the appellant before the Court\n\nwas tried and convicted under a Georgia statute for knowingly\n\nhaving possession of obscene material in his home. The U.S.\n\nSupreme Court referred to judgments which had held that\n\nobscenity is not within the area of constitutionally protected\n\nspeech under the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\n\nYet, the Court held:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_579\">     “It is now well established that the Constitution\n     protects the right to receive information and ideas.\n     “This freedom [of speech and press] … necessarily\n     protects the right to receive……” Martin v.

This right to\n     receive information and ideas, regardless of their\n     social worth, see Winters v. New York, 333 US 507,\n     510, 92 L Ed 840, 847, 68 S Ct 665 (1948), is\n     fundamental to our free society. Moreover, in the\n     context of this case—a prosecution for mere\n     possession of printed or filmed matter in the privacy\n     of a person&#x27;s own home—that right takes on an\n     added dimension. For also fundamental is the right\n     to be free, except in very limited circumstances,\n     from unwanted governmental intrusions into one&#x27;s\n     privacy…\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1160\">                                                                  59</span>\n\f      These are the rights that appellant is asserting in\n      the case before us. He is asserting the right to read\n      or observe what he pleases—the right to satisfy his\n      intellectual and emotional needs in the privacy of his\n      own home. He is asserting the right to be free from\n      state inquiry into the contents of his library. Georgia\n      contends that appellant does not have these rights,\n      that there are certain types of materials that the\n      individual may not read or even possess. Georgia\n      justifies this assertion by arguing that the films in the\n      present case are obscene. But we think that mere\n      categorization of these films as “obscene” is\n      insufficient justification for such a drastic invasion of\n      personal liberties guaranteed by the First and\n      Fourteenth Amendments. Whatever may be the\n      justifications for other statutes regulating obscenity,\n      we do not think they reach into the privacy of one&#x27;s\n      own home. If the First Amendment means anything,\n      it means that a State has no business telling a man,\n      sitting alone in his own house, what books he may\n      read or what films he may watch. Our whole\n      constitutional heritage rebels at the thought of giving\n      government the power to control men&#x27;s minds.”\n                                         (Emphasis Supplied)\n\n      The Court concluded by stating:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_580\">      “We hold that the First and Fourteenth Amendments\n      prohibit making mere private possession of obscene\n      material a crime. Roth and the cases following that\n      decision are not impaired by today&#x27;s holding. As we\n      have said, the States retain broad power to regulate\n      obscenity; that power simply does not extend to\n      mere possession by the individual in the privacy of\n      his own home.”\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_581\">50.   This case, more than any other, brings out in bold relief,\n\nthe difference between the right to privacy and the right to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1161\">                                                                   60</span>\n\ffreedom of speech.       Obscenity was held to be outside the\n\nfreedom of speech amended by the First Amendment, but a\n\nprivacy interest which related to the right to read obscene\n\nmaterial was protected under the very same Amendment.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_551\">Obviously, therefore, neither is privacy as vague and\n\namorphous as has been argued, nor is it correct to state that\n\nunless it finds express mention in a provision in Part III of the\n\nConstitution, it should not be regarded as a fundamental right.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_552\">51.   Shri Sundaram’s argument that personal liberty is\n\ndifferent from civil liberty need not detain us at all for the reason\n\nthat at least qua the fundament right to privacy — that right\n\nbeing intimately connected with the liberty of the person would\n\ncertainly fall within the expression “personal liberty”.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_553\">52.   According to Shri Sundaram, every facet of privacy is not\n\nprotected. Instances of actions which, according to him, are not\n\nprotected are:\n</p>\n<pre id=\"pre_21\">      •     “Taxation laws requiring the furnishing of\n\n      information;\n\n      •     In relation to a census;\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1162\">                                                                        61</span>\n\f      •     Details   and   documents     required    to   be\n\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_554\">      furnished for the purpose of obtaining a passport;\n</p>\n<pre id=\"pre_22\">      •     Prohibitions     pertaining      to      viewing\n\n      pornography.”\n\n\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_555\">53.   We are afraid that this is really putting the cart before the\n\nhorse. Taxation laws which require the furnishing of information\n\ncertainly impinge upon the privacy of every individual which\n\nought to receive protection. Indeed, most taxation laws which\n\nrequire the furnishing of such information also have, as a\n\nconcomitant    provision,    provisions    which     prohibit   the\n\ndissemination of such information to others except under\n\nspecified circumstances which have relation to some legitimate\n\nor important State or societal interest. The same would be the\n\ncase in relation to a census and details and documents\n\nrequired to be furnished for obtaining a passport. Prohibitions\n\npertaining to viewing pornography have been dealt with earlier\n\nin this judgment.     The U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in\n\nStanley (supra) held that such prohibitions would be invalid if\n\nthe State were to intrude into the privacy of one’s home.\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1163\">                                                                      62</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_556\">\f<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"675008\" id=\"span_1164\">54.

In any\n\nevent, the analogy to be drawn from the cases dealing with\n\nliquor does not take us further for the simple reason that the\n\nfundamental right to privacy once recognized, must yield in\n\ngiven circumstances to legitimate State interests in combating\n\ncrime.

Statutory law can be made and also unmade by a simple\n\nParliamentary majority. In short, the ruling party can, at will, do\n\naway with any or all of the protections contained in the statutes\n\nmentioned hereinabove.       Fundamental rights, on the other\n\nhand, are contained in the Constitution so that there would be\n\nrights that the citizens of this country may enjoy despite the\n\ngovernments that they may elect. This is all the more so when\n\na particular fundamental right like privacy of the individual is an\n\n“inalienable” right which inheres in the individual because he is\n\na human being. The recognition of such right in the\n\nfundamental rights chapter of the Constitution is only a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1169\">                                                                       65</span>\n\frecognition that such right exists notwithstanding the shifting\n\nsands    of   majority   governments.     Statutes    may    protect\n\nfundamental rights; they may also infringe them. In case any\n\nexisting statute or any statute to be made in the future is an\n\ninfringement of the inalienable right to privacy, this Court would\n\nthen be required to test such statute against such fundamental\n\nright and if it is found that there is an infringement of such right,\n\nwithout any countervailing societal or public interest, it would be\n\nthe duty of this Court to declare such legislation to be void as\n\noffending the fundamental right to privacy.

In Minnesota v.

Post, at\n      110, citing Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 88\n      S.Ct. 507, 19 L.Ed.2d 576 (1967). In my view, the\n      only thing the past three decades have established\n      about the Katz test (which has come to mean the\n      test enunciated by Justice Harlan’s separate\n      concurrence in Katz, see id., at 360, 88 S.Ct. 507) is\n      that, unsurprisingly, those “actual (subjective)\n      expectation[s] of privacy” “that society is prepared to\n      recognize as ‘reasonable,’ ” id., at 361, 88 S.Ct.\n      507, bear an uncanny resemblance to those\n      expectations of privacy that this Court considers\n      reasonable. When that self-indulgent test is\n      employed (as the dissent would employ it here) to\n      determine whether a “search or seizure” within the\n      meaning of the Constitution has occurred (as\n      opposed to whether that “search or seizure” is an\n      “unreasonable” one), it has no plausible foundation\n      in the text of the Fourth Amendment. That provision\n      did not guarantee some generalized “right of\n      privacy” and leave it to this Court to determine\n      which particular manifestations of the value of\n      privacy “society is prepared to recognize as\n      ‘reasonable’.” Ibid.”\n\n\n      In Kyllo v.

In\n\nso holding, the U.S. Supreme Court stated:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_583\">     “The Katz test—whether the individual has an\n     expectation of privacy that society is prepared to\n     recognize as reasonable—has often been criticized\n     as circular, and hence subjective and unpredictable.\n     See 1 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure §2.1(d), pp.\n     393-394 (3d ed. 1996); Posner, The Uncertain\n     Protection of Privacy by the Supreme Court, 1979\n     S. Ct.

Ct. 421.\n     While it may be difficult to refine Katz when the\n     search of areas such as telephone booths,\n     automobiles, or even the curtilage and uncovered\n     portions of residences are at issue, in the case of\n     the search of the interior of homes—the prototypical\n     and hence most commonly litigated area of\n     protected privacy—there is a ready criterion, with\n     roots deep in the common law, of the minimal\n     expectation of privacy that exists, and that is\n     acknowledged to be reasonable. To withdraw\n     protection of this minimum expectation would be to\n     permit police technology to erode the privacy\n     guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment. We think\n     that obtaining by sense-enhancing technology any\n     information regarding the interior of the home that\n     could not otherwise have been obtained without\n     physical “intrusion into a constitutionally protected\n     area,” Silverman, 365 U.S., at 512, 81 S.

Also, as has rightly been held, the\n\ntest is circular in the sense that there is no invasion of privacy\n\nunless the individual whose privacy is invaded had a\n\nreasonable expectation of privacy. Whether such individual will\n\nor will not have such an expectation ought to depend on what\n\nthe position in law is. Also, this test is intrinsically linked with\n\nthe test of voluntarily parting with information, inasmuch as if\n\ninformation is voluntarily parted with, the person concerned can\n\nreasonably be said to have no expectation of any privacy\n\ninterest. This is nothing other than reading of the “reasonable\n\nexpectation of privacy” with the test in Miller (supra), which is\n\nthat if information is voluntarily parted with, no right to privacy\n\nexists. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1068532\" id=\"span_1173\">As has been held by us, in <a href=\"/doc/1068532/\" id=\"a_1123\">Canara Bank</a> (supra), this\n\nCourt referred to Miller (supra) and the criticism that it has\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1174\">                                                                        69</span>\n\freceived in the country of its origin, and refused to apply it in\n\nthe Indian context.</span> Also, as has been discussed above, soon\n\nafter    Miller   (supra),   the   Congress   enacted   the    Right\n\nto Financial Privacy Act, 1978, doing away with the substratum\n\nof this judgment.

If this is so, then statutes which\n\nwould enable the State to contractually obtain information about\n\npersons would pass muster in given circumstances, provided\n\nthey safeguard the individual right to privacy as well.

This can only be done by amending the\n\nConstitution. It was, therefore, urged that it was not open for us\n\nto interpret the fundamental rights chapter in such a manner as\n\nto introduce a fundamental right to privacy, when the founding\n\nfathers had rejected the same. It is only the Parliament in its\n\nconstituent capacity that can introduce such a right.          This\n\ncontention must be rejected having regard to the authorities\n\ncited above.

Thus in an\n\n        early case, Olmstead v. United States, 277 U.S. 438 at 474,\n\n        478 and 479 (1928), the majority of the Court held that wiretaps\n\n        attached to telephone wires on public streets did not constitute\n\n        a “search” under the Fourth Amendment since there was no\n\n        physical entry into any house or office of the defendants. In a\n\n        classic dissenting judgment, Louis Brandeis, J. held that this\n\n\n\n9                                th\n This era lasted from the early 20 Century till 1937, when the proverbial switch in time that saved nine was made\nby Justice Roberts.

Ways may\n      someday be developed by which the Government,\n      without removing papers from secret drawers, can\n      reproduce them in court, and by which it will be\n      enabled to expose to a jury the most intimate\n      occurrences of the home. Advances in the psychic\n      and related sciences may bring means of exploring\n      unexpressed beliefs, thoughts and emotions. “That\n      places the liberty of every man in the hands of every\n      petty officer” was said by James Otis of much lesser\n      intrusions than these. To Lord Camden, a far\n      slighter intrusion seemed “subversive of all the\n      comforts of society.” Can it be that the Constitution\n      affords no protection against such invasions of\n      individual security?”\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_602\">69.

A large number of judgments of the U.S. Supreme Court\n\nsince Katz (supra) have recognized the right to privacy as\n\nfalling in one or other of the clauses of the Bill of Rights in the\n\nU.S. Constitution. Thus, in Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S.\n\n479 (1965), Douglas, J.’s majority opinion found that the right to\n\nprivacy was contained in the penumbral regions of the First,\n\nThird, Fourth and Fifth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_578\">Goldberg, J. found this right to be embedded in the Ninth\n\nAmendment which states that certain rights which are not\n\nenumerated are nonetheless recognized as being reserved to\n\nthe people.

There can be no doubt that privacy-dignity\n      claims deserve to be examined with care and to be\n      denied only when an important countervailing\n      interest is shown to be superior. If the Court does\n      find that a claimed right is entitled to protection as a\n      fundamental privacy right, a law infringing it must\n      satisfy the compelling State interest test. Then the\n      question would be whether a State interest is of\n      such paramount importance as would justify an\n      infringement of the right. Obviously, if the\n      enforcement of morality were held to be a\n      compelling as well as a permissible State interest,\n      the characterization of a claimed right as a\n      fundamental privacy right would be of far less\n      significance. The question whether enforcement of\n      morality is a State interest sufficient to justify the\n      infringement of a fundamental privacy right need not\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1221\">                                                                     84</span>\n\fbe considered for the purpose of this case and\ntherefore we refuse to enter the controversial thicket\nwhether enforcement of morality is a function of\nState.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_607\">23. Individual autonomy, perhaps the central\nconcern of any system of limited government, is\nprotected in part under our Constitution by explicit\nconstitutional guarantees. In the application of the\nConstitution our contemplation cannot only be of\nwhat has been but what may be. Time works\nchanges and brings into existence new conditions.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_582\">Subtler and far reaching means of invading privacy\nwill make it possible to be heard in the street what is\nwhispered in the closet. Yet, too broad a definition\nof privacy raises serious questions about the\npropriety of judicial reliance on a right that is not\nexplicit in the Constitution. Of course, privacy\nprimarily concerns the individuals. It therefore\nrelates to and overlaps with the concept of liberty.\nThe most serious advocate of privacy must confess\nthat there are serious problems of defining the\nessence and scope of the right. Privacy interest in\nautonomy must also be placed in the context of\nother rights and values.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_583\">24. Any right to privacy must encompass and\nprotect the personal intimacies of the home, the\nfamily marriage, motherhood, procreation and child\nrearing. This catalogue approach to the question is\nobviously not as instructive as it does not give\nanalytical picture of distinctive characteristics of the\nright of privacy. Perhaps, the only suggestion that\ncan be offered as unifying principle underlying the\nconcept has been the assertion that a claimed right\nmust be a fundamental right implicit in the concept\nof ordered liberty.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_584\">27. There are two possible theories for protecting\nprivacy of home. The first is that activities in the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1222\">                                                           85</span>\n\f      home harm others only to the extent that they cause\n      offence resulting from the mere thought that\n      individuals might be engaging in such activities and\n      that such ‘harm’ is not constitutionally protectable by\n      the State. The second is that individuals need a\n      place of sanctuary where they can be free from\n      societal control. The importance of such a sanctuary\n      is that individuals can drop the mask, desist for a\n      while from projecting on the world the image they\n      want to be accepted as themselves, an image that\n      may reflect the values of their peers rather than the\n      realities of their natures.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_585\">      28. The right to privacy in any event will\n      necessarily have to go through a process of case-\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_586\">      by-case development. Therefore, even assuming\n      that the right to personal liberty, the right to move\n      freely throughout the territory of India and the\n      freedom of speech create an independent right of\n      privacy as an emanation from them which one can\n      characterize as a fundamental right, we do not think\n      that the right is absolute.”\n                                         (at pages 155-157)\n\n      The Police Regulations were, however, not struck down,\n\nbut   were    termed   as   being   perilously   close   to     being\n\nunconstitutional.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_587\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_588\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"377237\" id=\"span_1223\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"377237\" id=\"span_1224\">73.

If he does so, he\n      would be violating the right to privacy of the person\n      concerned and would be liable in an action for\n      damages. Position may, however, be different, if a\n      person voluntarily thrusts himself into controversy or\n      voluntarily invites or raises a controversy.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_592\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1227\">                                                                   87</span>\n\f(2) The rule aforesaid is subject to the exception,\nthat any publication concerning the aforesaid\naspects     becomes      unobjectionable   if    such\npublication is based upon public records including\ncourt records. This is for the reason that once a\nmatter becomes a matter of public record, the right\nto privacy no longer subsists and it becomes a\nlegitimate subject for comment by press and media\namong others. We are, however, of the opinion that\nin the interests of decency [<a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_1167\">Article 19(2)]</a> an\nexception must be carved out to this rule, viz., a\nfemale who is the victim of a sexual assault, kidnap,\nabduction or a like offence should not further be\nsubjected to the indignity of her name and the\nincident being publicised in press/media.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_593\">(3) There is yet another exception to the rule in (1)\nabove—indeed, this is not an exception but an\nindependent rule. In the case of public officials, it is\nobvious, right to privacy, or for that matter, the\nremedy of action for damages is simply not\navailable with respect to their acts and conduct\nrelevant to the discharge of their official duties. This\nis so even where the publication is based upon facts\nand statements which are not true, unless the\nofficial establishes that the publication was made\n(by the defendant) with reckless disregard for truth.\nIn such a case, it would be enough for the\ndefendant (member of the press or media) to prove\nthat he acted after a reasonable verification of the\nfacts; it is not necessary for him to prove that what\nhe has written is true. Of course, where the\npublication is proved to be false and actuated by\nmalice or personal animosity, the defendant would\nhave no defence and would be liable for damages.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_594\">It is equally obvious that in matters not relevant to\nthe discharge of his duties, the public official enjoys\nthe same protection as any other citizen, as\nexplained in (1) and (2) above.

We must\n      recognise the importance of personal autonomy in\n      aspects such as the choice between remaining\n      silent and speaking. An individual’s decision to\n      make a statement is the product of a private choice\n      and there should be no scope for any other\n      individual to interfere with such autonomy,\n      especially in circumstances where the person faces\n      exposure to criminal charges or penalties.”\n                                       (at pages 369-370)\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_602\">77.   All this leads to a discussion on what exactly is the\n\nfundamental right of privacy – where does it fit in Chapter III of\n\nthe Constitution, and what are the parameters of its\n\nconstitutional protection.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_603\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_604\">78.   In an instructive article reported in Volume 64 of the\n\nCalifornia Law Review, written in 1976, Gary L. Bostwick\n\nsuggested that the right to privacy in fact encompasses three\n\nseparate and distinct rights. According to the learned author,\n\nthese three components are the components of repose,\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1240\">                                                                     94</span>\n\fsanctuary, and intimate decision. The learned author puts it\n\nthus (at pages 1482-1483):-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_621\">      “The extent of constitutional protection is not the\n      only distinction between the types of privacy. Each\n      zone protects a unique type of human transaction.\n      Repose maintains the actor’s peace; sanctuary\n      allows an individual to keep some things private,\n      and intimate decision grants the freedom to act in\n      an autonomous fashion. Whenever a generalized\n      claim to privacy is put forward without distinguishing\n      carefully between the transactional types, parties\n      and courts alike may become hopelessly muddled\n      in obscure claims. The clear standards that appear\n      within each zone are frequently ignored by\n      claimants anxious to retain some aspect of their\n      personal liberty and by courts impatient with the\n      indiscriminate invocation of privacy.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_622\">      Finally, it should be recognized that the right of\n      privacy is a continually evolving right. This\n      Comment has attempted to show what findings of\n      fact will lead to the legal conclusion that a person\n      has a right to privacy. Yet the same findings of fact\n      may lead to different conclusions of law as time\n      passes and society’s ideas change about how much\n      privacy is reasonable and what kinds of decisions\n      are best left to individual choice. Future litigants\n      must look to such changes in community concerns\n      and national acceptance of ideas as harbingers of\n      corresponding changes in the contours of the zones\n      of privacy.”\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_605\">79.   Shortly thereafter, in 1977, an instructive judgment is to\n\nbe found in Whalen v. Roe, 429 U.S. 589 at 598 and 599 by\n\nthe U.S. Supreme Court. This case dealt with a legislation by\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1241\">                                                                   95</span>\n\fthe State of New York in which the State, in a centralized\n\ncomputer file, registered the names and addresses of all\n\npersons    who    have      obtained,   pursuant   to    a   Doctor’s\n\nprescription, certain drugs for which there is both a lawful and\n\nunlawful market. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the statute,\n\nfinding that it would seem clear that the State’s vital interest in\n\ncontrolling the distribution of dangerous drugs would support\n\nthe legislation at hand. In an instructive footnote – 23 to the\n\njudgment, the U.S. Supreme Court found that the right to\n\nprivacy was grounded after Roe (supra) in the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment’s       concept    of   personal liberty.     Having thus\n\ngrounded the right, the U.S. Supreme Court in a very significant\n\npassage stated:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_623\">      “At the very least, it would seem clear that the\n      State’s vital interest in controlling the distribution of\n      dangerous drugs would support a decision to\n      experiment with new techniques for control…\n\n      …Appellees contend that the statute invades a\n      constitutionally protected “zone of privacy.” The\n      cases sometimes characterized as protecting\n      “privacy” have in fact involved at least two different\n      kinds of interests. One is the individual interest in\n      avoiding disclosure of personal matters, and\n      another is the interest in independence in making\n      certain kinds of important decisions.”\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1242\">                                                                        96</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_606\">\f80.

All these rights are therefore inter-\n      dependent and mutually reinforcing.

In the Indian context, a fundamental right to privacy would\n\ncover at least the following three aspects:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_630\">      • Privacy that involves the person i.e. when there is some\n\n        invasion by the State of a person’s rights relatable to\n\n        his physical body, such as the right to move freely;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_631\">      • Informational privacy which does not deal with a\n\n        person’s body but deals with a person’s mind, and\n\n        therefore recognizes that an individual may have\n\n        control over the dissemination of material that is\n\n        personal to him. Unauthorised use of such information\n\n        may, therefore lead to infringement of this right; and\n\n      • The privacy of choice, which protects an individual’s\n\n        autonomy over fundamental personal choices.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_632\">For instance, we can ground physical privacy or privacy relating\n\nto the body in <a href=\"/doc/1024002/\" id=\"a_1199\">Articles 19(1)(d)</a> and (e) read with <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1200\">Article 21;</a>\n</blockquote>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1245\">                                                                    99</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_633\">\fground personal information privacy under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1201\">Article 21;</a> and the\n\nprivacy of choice in <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_1202\">Articles 19(1)(a)</a> to (c), 20(3), 21 and 25.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_634\">The argument based on ‘privacy’ being a vague and nebulous\n\nconcept need not, therefore, detain us.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_635\">82.

In his well-known thesis “On Liberty”, John Stuart Mill, as\n\nfar back as in 1859, had this to say:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_637\">      “…. the sole end for which mankind are warranted,\n      individually or collectively, in interfering with the\n      liberty of action of any of their number, is self-\n      protection. That the only purpose for which power\n      can be rightfully exercised over any member of a\n      civilised community, against his will, is to prevent\n      harm to others. His own good, either physical or\n      moral, is not a sufficient warrant. He cannot\n      rightfully be compelled to do or forbear because it\n      will be better for him to do so, because it will make\n      him happier, because, in the opinions of others, to\n      do so would be wise, or even right. These are good\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1246\">                                                                    100</span>\n\freasons for remonstrating with him, or reasoning\nwith him, or persuading him, or entreating him, but\nnot for compelling him, or visiting him with any evil\nin case he do otherwise. To justify that, the conduct\nfrom which it is desired to deter him must be\ncalculated to produce evil to someone else. The\nonly part of the conduct of any one, for which he is\namenable to society, is that which concerns others.\nIn the part which merely concerns himself, his\nindependence is, of right, absolute. Over himself,\nover his own body and mind, the individual is\nsovereign.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_638\">(…)\nThis, then, is the appropriate region of human\nliberty. It comprises, first, the inward domain of\nconsciousness; demanding liberty of conscience in\nthe most comprehensive sense; liberty of thought\nand feeling; absolute freedom of opinion and\nsentiment on all subjects, practical or speculative,\nscientific, moral, or theological. The liberty of\nexpressing and publishing opinions may seem to fall\nunder a different principle, since it belongs to that\npart of the conduct of an individual which concerns\nother people; but, being almost of as much\nimportance as the liberty of thought itself, and\nresting in great part on the same reasons, is\npractically inseparable from it.         Secondly, the\nprinciple requires liberty of tastes and pursuits; of\nframing the plan of our life to suit our own character;\nof doing as we like, subject to such consequences\nas may follow: without impediment from our fellow\ncreatures, so long as what we do does not harm\nthem, even though they should think our conduct\nfoolish, perverse, or wrong. Thirdly, from this liberty\nof each individual, follows the liberty, within the\nsame limits, of combination among individuals;\nfreedom to unite, for any purpose not involving harm\nto others: the persons combining being supposed to\nbe of full age, and not forced or deceived.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1247\">                                                          101</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_639\">\f      No society in which these liberties are not, on the\n      whole, respected, is free, whatever may be its form\n      or government; and none is completely free in which\n      they do not exist absolute and unqualified. The only\n      freedom which deserves the name, is that of\n      pursuing our own good in our own way, so long as\n      we do not attempt to deprive others of theirs, or\n      impede their efforts to obtain it.”\n\nNoting the importance of liberty to individuality, Mill wrote:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_640\">      “It is not by wearing down into uniformity all that is\n      individual in themselves, but by cultivating it, and\n      calling it forth, within the limits imposed by the rights\n      and interests of others, that human beings become\n      a noble and beautiful object of contemplation; and\n      as the works partake the character of those who do\n      them, by the same process human life also\n      becomes rich, diversified, and animating, furnishing\n      more abundant aliment to high thoughts and\n      elevating feelings, and strengthening the tie which\n      binds every individual to the race, by making the\n      race infinitely better worth belonging to.             In\n      proportion to the development of his individuality,\n      each person becomes more valuable to himself,\n      and is therefore capable of being more valuable to\n      others. There is a greater fullness of life about his\n      own existence, and when there is more life in the\n      units there is more in the mass which is composed\n      of them….. The means of development which the\n      individual loses by being prevented from gratifying\n      his inclinations to the injury of others, are chiefly\n      obtained at the expense of the development of other\n      people…. To be held to rigid rules of justice for the\n      sake of others, develops the feelings and capacities\n      which have the good of others for their object. But\n      to be restrained in things not affecting their good, by\n      their mere displeasure, develops nothing valuable,\n      except such force of character as may unfold itself\n      in resisting the restraint.

If the\ninformation sought for is personal and has no\nrelationship with any public activity or interest or it\nwill not subserve larger public interest, the public\nauthority or the officer concerned is not legally\nobliged to provide those information.

Further, if the\n      authority finds that information sought for can be\n      made available in the larger public interest, then the\n      officer should record his reasons in writing before\n      providing the information, because the person from\n      whom information is sought for, has also a right to\n      privacy guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1247\">Article 21</a> of the\n      Constitution.”\n                                          (at page 112-114)</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_639\">89.

The right to life and\n        personal liberty is the most precious right of human\n        beings in civilised societies governed by the rule of\n        law. Many modern Constitutions incorporate certain\n        fundamental rights, including the one relating to\n        personal freedom. According to Blackstone, the\n        absolute rights of Englishmen were the rights of\n        personal security, personal liberty and private\n        property.      The      American      Declaration    of\n        Independence (1776) states that all men are\n        created equal, and among their inalienable rights\n        are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. The\n        Second Amendment to the US Constitution refers\n        inter alia to security of person, while the Fifth\n        Amendment prohibits inter alia deprivation of life\n\nHowever, the legal analysis in this Chapter confirms his conclusion though on different grounds\nfrom those which he has given.” (at Appendix pg. 2229).\n</blockquote>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1274\">                                                                                                  114</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_665\">\fand liberty without due process, of law. The different\nDeclarations of Human Rights and fundamental\nfreedoms have all laid stress upon the sanctity of\nlife and liberty.

The International Commission of Jurists, which\nis affiliated to UNESCO, has been attempting with,\nconsiderable success to give material content to\n“the rule of law”, an expression used in the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights. One of its\nmost notable achievements was the Declaration of\nDelhi, 1959. This resulted from a Congress held in\nNew Delhi attended by jurists from more than 50\ncountries, and was based on a questionnaire\ncirculated to 75,000 lawyers. “Respect for the\nsupreme value of human personality” was stated to\nbe the basis of all law (see page 21 of the\nConstitutional and Administrative Law by O.

These\nfundamental rights are important as they\npossess intrinsic value. Part III of the\nConstitution does not confer fundamental\nrights. It confirms their existence and gives\nthem protection. Its purpose is to withdraw\ncertain subjects from the area of political\ncontroversy to place them beyond the reach of\nmajorities and officials and to establish them\nas legal principles to be applied by the courts.\nEvery right has a content. Every foundational\nvalue is put in Part III as a fundamental right\nas it has intrinsic value. The converse does\nnot apply. A right becomes a fundamental\nright because it has foundational value.

Chandrachud.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_659\">Having read them carefully, I have nothing more\n\nuseful to add to the reasoning and the conclusion\n\narrived at by my esteemed brothers in their respective\n\nopinions.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_660\">2)   However, keeping in view the importance of the\n\nquestions referred to this Bench, I wish to add only\n\nfew words of concurrence of my own.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_661\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1317\">                                                         3</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_662\">\f<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1306519\" id=\"span_1318\">3)   In substance, two questions were referred to this\n\nNine Judge Bench, first, whether the law laid down in\n\nthe case of <a href=\"/doc/1306519/\" id=\"a_1287\">M.P.Sharma and others vs. Satish\n\nChandra, District Magistrate Delhi &amp; Ors.</a>, AIR 1954\n\nSC 300 and Kharak Singh vs. State of Uttar Pradesh\n\n&amp; Ors. AIR 1963 SC 1295 insofar as it relates to the\n\n&quot;right to privacy of an individual”        is correct and\n\nsecond, whether &quot;right to privacy&quot; is a fundamental\n\nright under Part III of the Constitution of India?</span></p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_663\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_664\">4)   Before I examine these two questions, it is\n\napposite   to   take   note   of   the   Preamble    to   the\n\nConstitution, which, in my view, has bearing on the\n\nquestions referred.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_665\">5)   The Preamble to the Constitution reads as\n\nunder:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_679\">     “WE, THE PEOPLE OF INDIA, having\n     solemnly resolved to constitute India into a\n     SOVEREIGN        SOCIALIST         SECULAR\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1319\">                                                                4</span>\n\f     DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC and to secure to all\n     its citizens:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_680\">     JUSTICE, social, economic and political;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_681\">     LIBERTY of thought, expression, belief, faith\n     and worship;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_682\">     EQUALITY of status and of opportunity;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_683\">     And to promote among them all\n     FRATERNITY assuring the dignity of the\n     individual and the unity and integrity of the\n     Nation;”\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_684\">6)   Perusal of the words in the Preamble would go to\n\nshow that every word used therein was cautiously\n\nchosen by the founding fathers and then these words\n\nwere arranged and accordingly placed in a proper\n\norder. Every word incorporated in the Preamble has\n\nsignificance and proper meaning.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_685\">7)   The most important place of pride was given to\n\nthe &quot;People of India&quot; by using the expression, WE, THE\n\nPEOPLE OF INDIA, in the beginning of the Preamble.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_666\">The Constitution was accordingly adopted, enacted\n\nand then given to ourselves.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_667\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1320\">                                                         5</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_668\">\f8)   The keynote of the Preamble was to lay emphasis\n\non two positive aspects – one, &quot;the Unity of the Nation&quot;\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_669\">and the second &quot;Dignity of the individual&quot;.         The\n\nexpression &quot;Dignity&quot; carried with it moral and spiritual\n\nimports. It also implied an obligation on the part of\n\nthe Union to respect the personality of every citizen\n\nand create the conditions in which every citizen would\n\nbe left free to find himself/herself and attain self-\n\nfulfillment.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_670\">9)   The incorporation of expression &quot;Dignity of the\n\nindividual&quot; in the Preamble was aimed essentially to\n\nshow explicit repudiation of what people of this\n\nCountry had inherited from the past. Dignity of the\n\nindividual was, therefore, always considered the prime\n\nconstituent of the fraternity, which assures the dignity\n\nto    every    individual.   Both    expressions    are\n\ninterdependent and intertwined.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_671\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1321\">                                                           6</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_672\">\f10)   In my view, unity and integrity of the Nation\n\ncannot survive unless the dignity of every individual\n\ncitizen is guaranteed. It is inconceivable to think of\n\nunity and integration without the assurance to an\n\nindividual to preserve his dignity. In other words,\n\nregard and respect by every individual for the dignity\n\nof the other one brings the unity and integrity of the\n\nNation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_673\">11)   The    expressions   &quot;liberty“,   &quot;equality&quot;   and\n\n&quot;fraternity&quot; incorporated in the Preamble are not\n\nseparate entities. They have to be read in juxtaposition\n\nwhile dealing with the rights of the citizens. They, in\n\nfact, form a union. If these expressions are divorced\n\nfrom each other, it will defeat the very purpose of\n\ndemocracy.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_674\">12)   In other words, liberty cannot be divorced from\n\nequality so also equality cannot be divorced from\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1322\">                                                           7</span>\n\fliberty and nor can liberty and equality be divorced\n\nfrom    fraternity.   The   meaning   assigned   to   these\n\nexpressions has to be given due weightage while\n\ninterpreting Articles of Part III of the Constitution.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_675\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1611825\" id=\"span_1323\">13)    It is, therefore, the duty of the Courts and\n\nespecially this Court as sentinel on the qui vive to\n\nstrike a balance between the changing needs of the\n\nSociety and the protection of the rights of the citizens\n\nas and when the issue relating to the infringement of\n\nthe rights of the citizen comes up for consideration.\n\nSuch a balance can be achieved only through securing\n\nand protecting liberty, equality and fraternity with\n\nsocial and political justice to all the citizens under rule\n\nof law (see-S.S. <a href=\"/doc/1611825/\" id=\"a_1288\">Bola &amp; Ors. vs. B.D. Sardana &amp; Ors</a>.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_676\">1997 (8) SCC 522).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_677\">14)    Our Constitution has recognized certain existing\n\ncherished rights of an individual. These rights are\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1324\">                                                              8</span>\n\fincorporated in different Articles of Part III of the\n\nConstitution under the heading-Fundamental Rights.\n\nIn so doing, some rights were incorporated and those,\n\nwhich were not incorporated, were read in Part III by\n\nprocess of judicial interpretation depending upon the\n\nnature of right asserted by the citizens on case-to-case\n\nbasis.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_678\">15)   It was not possible for the framers of the\n\nConstitution to incorporate each and every right be\n\nthat a natural or common law right of an individual in\n\nPart III of the Constitution. Indeed, as we can see\n\nwhenever occasion arose in the last 50 years to decide\n\nas to whether any particular right alleged by the\n\ncitizen is a fundamental right or not, this Court with\n\nthe process of judicial interpretation recognized with\n\nremarkable   clarity   several   existing   natural   and\n\ncommon law rights of an individual as fundamental\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1325\">                                                            9</span>\n\frights falling in Part III though not defined in the\n\nConstitution. It was done keeping in view the fact that\n\nthe Constitution is a sacred living document and,\n\nhence, susceptible to appropriate interpretation of its\n\nprovisions based on changing needs of &quot;We, the\n\nPeople” and other well defined parameters.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_679\">16)   <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1289\">Article 21</a> is perhaps the smallest Article in terms\n\nof words (18) in the Constitution. It is the heart of the\n\nConstitution as was said by Dr. B. R. Ambedkar. It\n\nreads as under: -\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_686\">      “No person shall be deprived of his life or\n      personal   liberty   except    according to\n      procedure established by law.”\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_687\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"45326369\" id=\"span_1326\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1857950\" id=\"span_1327\">17)   This Article is in Part III of the Constitution and\n\ndeals with Fundamental      rights of the citizens.

The great Judges of this Court with their\n\nvast knowledge, matured thoughts, learning and with\n\ntheir inimitable style of writing coupled with the able\n\nassistance of great lawyers gradually went on to\n\nexpand the meaning of the golden words (personal\n\nliberty) with remarkable clarity and precision.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_689\">19)   The learned Judges endeavored and expanded\n\nthe width of the fundamental rights and preserved the\n\nfreedom of the citizens. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"45326369\" id=\"span_1329\">In the process of the judicial\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1330\">                                                          11</span>\n\fevolution, the law <a href=\"/doc/45326369/\" id=\"a_1293\">laid down in</a> some earlier cases was\n\neither overruled or their correctness doubted.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_690\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"513801\" id=\"span_1331\">20)   It is a settled rule of interpretation as held in the\n\ncase of <a href=\"/doc/513801/\" id=\"a_1294\">Rustom Cavasjee Cooper vs. Union of India</a>,\n\n(1970) 1 SCC 248 that the Court should always make\n\nattempt to expand the reach and ambit of the\n\nfundamental rights rather than to attenuate their\n\nmeaning and the content by process of judicial\n\nconstruction.</span> Similarly, it is also a settled principle of\n\nlaw laid down in His Holiness Kesavananda Bharati\n\nSripadagalvaru vs. State of Kerala &amp; Anr., (1973) 4\n\nSCC 225      that the     Preamble is a      part of the\n\nConstitution and, therefore, while interpreting any\n\nprovision   of   the   Constitution   or   examining   any\n\nconstitutional issue or while determining the width or\n\nreach of any provision or when any ambiguity or\n\nobscurity is noticed in any provision, which needs to\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1332\">                                                              12</span>\n\fbe clarified, or when the language admits of meaning\n\nmore than one, the Preamble to the Constitution may\n\nbe relied on as a remedy for mischief or/and to find\n\nout the true meaning of the relevant provision as the\n\ncase may be.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_691\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"513801\" id=\"span_1333\">21)   In my considered opinion, the two questions\n\nreferred herein along with few incidental questions\n\narising therefrom need to be examined carefully in the\n\nlight of law <a href=\"/doc/513801/\" id=\"a_1295\">laid down by</a> this Court in several decided\n\ncases.   Indeed, the answer to the questions can be\n\nfound in the law <a href=\"/doc/513801/\" id=\"a_1296\">laid down in</a> the decided cases of this\n\nCourt alone and one may not require taking the help of\n\nthe law <a href=\"/doc/513801/\" id=\"a_1297\">laid down by</a> the American Courts.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_692\">22)   It is true that while interpreting our laws, the\n\nEnglish decisions do guide us in reaching to a\n\nparticular conclusion arising for consideration.

Such right remains\n\nwith the human being till he/she breathes last. It is\n\nindeed inseparable and inalienable from human being.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_680\">In other words, it is born with the human being and\n\nextinguish with human being.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_681\">26)   One cannot conceive an individual enjoying\n\nmeaningful life with dignity without such right. Indeed,\n\nit is one of those cherished rights, which every civilized\n\nsociety governed by rule of law always recognizes in\n\nevery human being and is under obligation to\n\nrecognize such rights in order to maintain and\n\npreserve the dignity of an individual regardless of\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1337\">                                                             15</span>\n\fgender, race, religion, caste and creed.

I have had the benefit of reading the exhaustive and erudite\n\nopinions of Rohinton F. Nariman, J, and Dr. D.Y. Chandrachud, J.      The\n\nconclusion is the same, answering the reference that privacy is not just a\n\ncommon law right, but a fundamental right falling in Part III of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1363\">\f                                                                              3</span>\n\n\nConstitution of India. I agree with this conclusion as privacy is a primal,\n\nnatural right which is inherent to an individual. However, I am tempted\n\nto set out my perspective on the issue of privacy as a right, which to my\n\nmind, is an important core of any individual existence.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_698\">2.     A human being, from an individual existence, evolved into a\n\nsocial animal. Society thus envisaged a collective living beyond the\n\nindividual as a unit to what came to be known as the family. This, in\n\nturn, imposed duties and obligations towards the society. The right to\n\n“do as you please” became circumscribed by norms commonly\n\nacceptable to the larger social group. In time, the acceptable norms\n\nevolved into formal legal principles.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_699\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_700\">3.     “The right to be”, though not extinguished for an individual, as\n\nthe society evolved, became hedged in by the complexity of the norms.\n\nThere has been a growing concern of the impact of technology which\n\nbreaches this “right to be”, or privacy – by whatever name we may call\n\nit.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_701\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_702\">4.     The importance of privacy may vary from person to person\n\ndependent on his/her approach to society and his concern for being left\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1364\">\f                                                                            4</span>\n\n\nalone or not. That some people do not attach importance to their\n\nprivacy cannot be the basis for denying recognition to the right to\n\nprivacy as a basic human right.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_703\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_704\">5.     It is not India alone, but the world that recognises the right of\n\nprivacy as a basic human right.

The importance of this right to privacy cannot be diluted and the\n\nsignificance of this is that the legal conundrum was debated and is to be\n\nsettled in the present reference by a nine-Judges Constitution Bench.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_707\">7.     This reference has arisen from the challenge to what is called the\n\n‘Aadhar Card Scheme’.

Privacy Concerns Against The State\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_718\">        13.       The growth and development of technology has created new\n\n        instruments for the possible invasion of privacy by the State, including\n\n        through surveillance, profiling and data collection and processing.\n\n        Surveillance is not new, but technology has permitted surveillance in\n\n        ways that are unimaginable. Edward Snowden shocked the world with\n\n        his disclosures about global surveillance. States are utilizing technology\n\n        in the most imaginative ways particularly in view of increasing global\n\n        terrorist attacks and heightened public safety concerns. One such\n\n        technique being adopted by States is ‘profiling’. The European Union\n\n        Regulation of 20164 on data privacy defines ‘Profiling’ as any form of\n\n        automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal\n\n        data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in\n\n        particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning that natural person&#x27;s\n\n        performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences,\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1371\">4</span>\n Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of\nnatural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and\nrepealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1372\">\f                                                                                                                8</span>\n\n\n        interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements5. Such profiling\n\n        can result in discrimination based on religion, ethnicity and caste.\n\n        However, ‘profiling’ can also be used to further public interest and for\n\n        the benefit of national security.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_719\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_720\">        14.

Further, in this digital age, individuals are constantly generating\n\n        valuable data which can be used by non-State actors to track their\n\n        moves, choices and preferences.

And ‘Airbnb’, the world’s largest accommodation provider,\n\n        owns no real estate. Something interesting is happening.”7 ‘Uber’ knows\n\n        our whereabouts and the places we frequent. ‘Facebook’ at the least,\n\n        knows who we are friends with. ‘Alibaba’ knows our shopping habits.\n\n        ‘Airbnb’ knows where we are travelling to. Social networks providers,\n\n        search engines, e-mail service providers, messaging applications are all\n\n        further examples of non-state actors that have extensive knowledge of\n\n        our movements, financial transactions, conversations – both personal\n\n        and professional, health, mental state, interest, travel locations, fares\n\n        and shopping habits.

These digital footprints and extensive data can be analyzed\n\ncomputationally to reveal patterns, trends, and associations, especially\n\nrelating to human behavior and interactions and hence, is valuable\n\ninformation. This is the age of ‘big data’. The advancement in technology\n\nhas created not just new forms of data, but also new methods of\n\nanalysing the data and has led to the discovery of new uses for data. The\n\nalgorithms are more effective and the computational power has\n\nmagnified exponentially. A large number of people would like to keep\n\nsuch search history private, but it rarely remains private, and is collected,\n\nsold and analysed for purposes such as targeted advertising. Of course,\n\n‘big data’ can also be used to further public interest. There may be cases\n\nwhere collection and processing of big data is legitimate and\n\nproportionate, despite being invasive of privacy otherwise.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_725\">19.

Thus, there is an unprecedented need for regulation regarding\n\n        the extent to which such information can be stored, processed and used\n\n        by non-state actors. There is also a need for protection of such\n\n        information from the State. Our Government was successful in\n\n        compelling Blackberry to give to it the ability to intercept data sent over\n\n        Blackberry devices.

The concept of ‘invasion of privacy’ is not the early conventional\n\n        thought process of ‘poking ones nose in another person’s affairs’. It is\n\n        not so simplistic.

It has also to\n                        be borne in mind that a Constitution is not a gate but a\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1390\">12</span>\n     (1973) 4 SCC 225\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1391\">\f                                                                   17</span>\n\n\nroad. Beneath the drafting of a Constitution is the\nawareness that things do not stand still but move on, that\nlife of a progressive nation, as of an individual, is not static\nand stagnant but dynamic and dashful.

It had (sic) its roots in the\npast, its continuity is reflected in the present and it is\nintended for the unknown future. The words of Holmes\nwhile dealing with the U.S. Constitution have equal\nrelevance for our Constitution.

The boundaries that\n\npeople establish from others in society are not only physical but also\n\ninformational. There are different kinds of boundaries in respect to\n\ndifferent relations.   Privacy assists in preventing awkward social\n\nsituations and reducing social frictions. Most of the information about\n\nindividuals can fall under the phrase “none of your business”. On\n\ninformation being shared voluntarily, the same may be said to be in\n\nconfidence and any breach of confidentiality is a breach of the trust.\n\nThis is more so in the professional relationships such as with doctors and\n\nlawyers which requires an element of candor in disclosure of\n\ninformation. An individual has the right to control one’s life while\n\nsubmitting personal data for various facilities and services. It is but\n\nessential that the individual knows as to what the data is being used for\n\nwith the ability to correct and amend it. The hallmark of freedom in a\n\ndemocracy is having the autonomy and control over our lives which\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1409\">\f                                                                                       28</span>\n\n\n        becomes impossible, if important decisions are made in secret without\n\n        our awareness or participation.17\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_782\">        54.

Nariman,J., recognizes informational privacy which\n\n        recognizes that an individual may have control over the dissemination of\n\n        material which is personal to him. Recognized thus, from the right to\n\n        privacy in this modern age emanate certain other rights such as the right\n\n        of individuals to exclusively commercially exploit their identity and\n\n        personal information, to control the information that is available about\n\n        them on the ‘world wide web’ and to disseminate certain personal\n\n        information for limited purposes alone.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_783\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_784\">        55.

Shah, which submitted a report on\n\n16 October, 2012.       The five salient features, in his own words, are as\n\nfollows:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_821\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_745\">       “1. Technological Neutrality and Interoperability with\n       International Standards: The Group agreed that any\n       proposed framework for privacy legislation must be\n       technologically neutral and interoperable with international\n       standards. Specifically the Privacy Act should not make any\n       reference to specific technologies and must be generic\n       enough such that the principles and enforcement\n       mechanisms remain adaptable to changes in society, the\n       marketplace, technology, and the government. To do this it\n       is important to closely harmonise the right to privacy with\n       multiple international regimes, create trust and facilitate co-\n       operation between national and international stakeholders\n       and provide equal and adequate levels of protection to data\n       processed inside India as well as outside it. In doing so, the\n       framework should recognise that data has economic value,\n       and that global data flows generate value for the individual\n       as data creator, and for businesses that collect and process\n       such data. Thus, one of the focuses of the framework\n       should be on inspiring the trust of global clients and their\n       end users, without compromising the interests of domestic\n       customers in enhancing their privacy protection.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_746\">           2. Multi-Dimensional Privacy: This report recognises the\n           right to privacy in its multiple dimensions. A framework on\n           the right to privacy in India must include privacy-related\n           concerns around data protection on the internet and\n           challenges emerging therefrom, appropriate protection\n           from unauthorised interception, audio and video\n           surveillance, use of personal identifiers, bodily privacy\n           including DNA as well as physical privacy, which are crucial\n           in establishing a national ethos for privacy protection,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1437\">\f                                                                 41</span>\n\n\nthough the specific forms such protection will take must\nremain flexible to address new and emerging concerns.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_747\">3. Horizontal Applicability: The Group agreed that any\nproposed privacy legislation must apply both to the\ngovernment as well as to the private sector. Given that the\ninternational trend is towards a set of unified norms\ngoverning both the private and public sector, and both\nsectors process large amounts of data in India, it is\nimperative to bring both within the purview of the\nproposed legislation.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_748\">4. Conformity with Privacy Principles: This report\nrecommends nine fundamental Privacy Principles to form\nthe bedrock of the proposed Privacy Act in India. These\nprinciples, drawn from best practices internationally, and\nadapted suitably to an Indian context, are intended to\nprovide the baseline level of privacy protection to all\nindividual data subjects. The fundamental philosophy\nunderlining the principles is the need to hold the data\ncontroller accountable for the collection, processing and\nuse to which the data is put thereby ensuring that the\nprivacy of the data subject is guaranteed.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_749\">5.    Co-Regulatory Enforcement Regime: This report\nrecommends the establishment of the office of the Privacy\nCommissioner, both at the central and regional levels. The\nPrivacy Commissioners shall be the primary authority for\nenforcement of the provisions of the Act. However, rather\nthan prescribe a pure top-down approach to enforcement,\nthis report recommends a system of co-regulation, with\nequal emphasis on Self-Regulating Organisations (SROs)\nbeing vested with the responsibility of autonomously\nensuring compliance with the Act, subject to regular\noversight by the Privacy Commissioners. The SROs, apart\nfrom possessing industry-specific knowledge, will also be\nbetter placed to create awareness about the right to\nprivacy and explaining the sensitivities of privacy protection\nboth within industry as well as to the public in respective\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1438\">\f                                                                          42</span>\n\n\n        sectors. This recommendation of a co-regulatory regime\n        will not derogate from the powers of courts which will be\n        available as a forum of last resort in case of persistent and\n        unresolved violations of the Privacy Act.”\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_750\">75.   The enactment of a law on the subject is still awaited. This was\n\npreceded by the Privacy Bill of the year of 2005 but there appears to have\n\nbeen little progress. It was only in the course of the hearing that we were\n\npresented with an office memorandum of the Ministry of Electronics and\n\nInformation Technology dated 31.7.2017, through which a Committee of\n\nExperts had been constituted to deliberate on a data protection\n\nframework for India, under the Chairmanship of Mr. Justice B.N.\n\nSrikrishna, former Judge of the Supreme Court of India, in order to\n\nidentify key data protection issues in India and recommend methods of\n\naddressing them. So there is hope !\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_751\">76.   The aforesaid aspect has been referred to for purposes that the\n\nconcerns about privacy have been left unattended for quite some time\n\nand thus an infringement of the right of privacy cannot be left to be\n\nformulated by the legislature. It is a primal natural right which is only\n\nbeing recognized as a fundamental right falling in part III of the\n\nConstitution of India.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1439\">\f                                                                          43</span>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_822\">CONCLUSION\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_823\">77.   The right of privacy is a fundamental right. It is a right which\n\nprotects the inner sphere of the individual from interference from both\n\nState, and non-State actors and allows the individuals to make\n\nautonomous life choices.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_824\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_825\">78.   It was rightly expressed on behalf of the petitioners that the\n\ntechnology has made it possible to enter a citizen’s house without\n\nknocking at his/her door and this is equally possible both by the State and\n\nnon-State actors. It is an individual’s choice as to who enters his house,\n\nhow he lives and in what relationship. The privacy of the home must\n\nprotect the family, marriage, procreation and sexual orientation which are\n\nall important aspects of dignity.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_826\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_827\">79.   If the individual permits someone to enter the house it does not\n\nmean that others can enter the house.      The only check and balance is\n\nthat it should not harm the other individual or affect his or her rights.\n\nThis applies both to the physical form and to technology. In an era where\n\nthere are wide, varied, social and cultural norms and more so in a country\n\nlike ours which prides itself on its diversity, privacy is one of the most\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1440\">\f                                                                                     44</span>\n\n\n           important rights to be protected both against State and non-State actors\n\n           and be recognized as a fundamental right. How it thereafter works out in\n\n           its inter-play with other fundamental rights and when such restrictions\n\n           would become necessary would depend on the factual matrix of each\n\n           case. That it may give rise to more litigation can hardly be the reason not\n\n           to recognize this important, natural, primordial right as a fundamental\n\n           right.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_828\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_829\">           <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"58730926\" id=\"span_1441\">80.        There are two aspects of the opinion of Dr. D.Y. Chandrachud,J.,\n\n           one of which is common to the opinion of Rohinton F. Nariman,J.,\n\n           needing specific mention.           While considering the evolution of\n\n           Constitutional jurisprudence on the right of privacy he has referred to the\n\n           judgment in <a href=\"/doc/58730926/\" id=\"a_1329\">Suresh Kumar Koushal Vs. Naz Foundation.32 In</a> the challenge\n\n           laid to <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_1330\">Section 377</a> of the Indian Penal Code before the Delhi High Court,\n\n           one of the grounds of challenge was that the said provision amounted to\n\n           an infringement of the right to dignity and privacy. The Delhi High Court,\n\n           inter alia, observed that the right to live with dignity and the right of\n\n           privacy both are recognized as dimensions of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1331\">Article 21</a> of the\n\n           Constitution of India. The view of the High Court, however did not find\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1442\">32</span>\n     (2014) 1 SCC 1\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1443\">\f                                                                                   45</span>\n\n\n          favour with the Supreme Court and it was observed that only a miniscule\n\n          fraction of the country’s population constitutes lesbians, gays, bisexuals\n\n          or transgenders and thus, there cannot be any basis for declaring the\n\n          Section ultra virus of provisions of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_1332\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_1333\">, 15</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1334\">21</a> of the\n\n          Constitution. The matter did not rest at this, as the issue of privacy and\n\n          dignity discussed by the High Court was also observed upon. The sexual\n\n          orientation even within the four walls of the house thus became an\n\n          aspect of debate.     I am in agreement with the view of Dr. D.Y.\n\n          Chandrachud, J., who in paragraphs 123 &amp; 124 of his judgment, states\n\n          that the right of privacy cannot be denied, even if there is a miniscule\n\n          fraction of the population which is affected. The majoritarian concept\n\n          does not apply to Constitutional rights and the Courts are often called up\n\n          on to take what may be categorized as a non-majoritarian view, in the\n\n          check and balance of power envisaged under the Constitution of India.\n\n          Ones sexual orientation is undoubtedly an attribute of privacy.</span>       The\n\n          observations made in Mosley vs. News Group Papers Ltd. 33, in a broader\n\n          concept may be usefully referred to:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_830\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1444\">33</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_752\">     (2008) EWHS 1777 (QB)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1445\">\f                                                                            46</span>\n\n\n       “130… It is not simply a matter of personal privacy versus\n       the public interest.

When the courts identify an infringement of a\n       person’s <a href=\"/doc/691208/\" id=\"a_1335\">Article 8</a> rights, and in particular in the context of\n       his freedom to conduct his sex life and personal\n       relationships as he wishes, it is right to afford a remedy and\n       to vindicate that right. The only permitted exception is\n       where there is a countervailing public interest which in the\n       particular circumstances is strong enough to outweigh it;\n       that is to say, because one at least of the established\n       “limiting principles” comes into play. Was it necessary and\n       proportionate for the intrusion to take place, for example,\n       in order to expose illegal activity or to prevent the public\n       from being significantly misled by public claims hitherto\n       made by the individual concerned (as with Naomi\n       Campbell’s public denials of drug-taking)? Or was it\n       necessary because the information, in the words of the\n       Strasbourg court in Von Hannover at (60) and (76), would\n       make a contribution to “a debate of general interest”? That\n       is, of course, a very high test, it is yet to be determined how\n       far that doctrine will be taken in the courts of this\n       jurisdiction in relation to photography in public places. If\n       taken literally, it would mean a very significant change in\n       what is permitted.
