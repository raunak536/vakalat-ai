Challenge in all these appeals is to the common judgment dated\n\n            9.5.2011 passed by learned Single Judge whereby the writ petitions filed by the\n\n            appellants have been dismissed. In LPA No.1174 of 2011, the appellant - Punjab\n\n            Cricket Association, SAS Nagar (Mohali) is a society registered under the\n\n            <a href=\"/doc/1700055/\" id=\"a_1\">Societies&#x27; Registration Act, 1860</a>.        On 20.9.2007, respondent No.2 filed an\n\n            application under <a href=\"/doc/864781/\" id=\"a_2\">section 6(1)</a> of the Right to Information Act, 2005 (in short, &quot;the\n\n            <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_3\">RTI Act</a>&quot;) seeking information from the appellant society. Having got no reply,\n\n            respondent No.2 on 29.10.2007 filed a complaint, Annexure P.1 under <a href=\"/doc/66861/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 18\n\n            (1) (c)</a> of the RTI Act in the State Information Commission, Punjab (in short, SIC).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">            Notice of the complaint was issued to the appellant. The appellant objected to the\n\n            jurisdiction of the Information Commission under the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_5\">RTI Act</a>.      It was pointed out\n\n            that since the appellant society was not covered by the provisions of the said Act, it\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">Singh Gurbax</span>\n            was not under any obligation to provide the information sought.

Thereafter, another application was filed with a prayer to\n\n            adjudicate the question of jurisdiction first before proceeding in the matter.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">            Respondent No.2 filed written arguments on 31.1.2008 on the issue contending\n\n            that Punjab Cricket Association fell within the ambit of the term &quot;public authority&quot;\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">            under <a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 2(h)(d)(i)</a> of the RTI Act. The SIC vide order dated 31.1.2008,\n\n            Annexure P.5 directed the appellant to submit copies of certain documents to\n\n            decide the exact status of the Punjab Cricket Association. The appellant submitted\n\n            the required documents. It was further submitted by the appellant that there was\n\n            neither any regular grant nor any aid being given by the State or any of its\n\n            departments. Similarly, dissatisfied with the action of State Public Information\n\n            Officers (SPIOs) in not supplying the requisite information, some of the appellants\n\n            in connected cases filed appeals before the first appellate authority but no\n\n            information was supplied to them. Thereafter, they filed second appeals before the\n\n            State Information Commissions, Punjab and Haryana. The said appeals were\n\n            allowed and the SICs came to the conclusion that the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_8\">RTI Act</a> were\n\n            applicable to the appellant-institutions and that they were legally bound to provide\n\n            the information sought. The SIC vide order dated 19.8.2008, Annexure P.10 in LPA\n\n            No.1174 of 2011 declared the Punjab Cricket Association a &quot;public authority&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_5\">            within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 2(h)</a> of the RTI Act. Aggrieved by the order, the\n\n            appellant approached this Court through Civil writ petition. Similarly other\n\n            appellants also filed writ petitions in this Court. The said writ petitions have been\n\n            dismissed by the     learned Single Judge by a common judgment dated dated\n\n            9.5.2011 impugned herein.

It is not in dispute that the Society has not been\n                               constituted under an Act. Its functions like any other\n                               cooperative society are mainly regulated in terms of the\n                               provisions of the Act, except as provided in the bye-laws of\n                               the Society. The State has no say in the functions of the\n                               Society. Membership, acquisition of shares and all other\n                               matters are governed by the bye-laws framed under the Act.\n                               The terms and conditions of an officer of the cooperative\n                               society, indisputably, are governed by the Rules. Rule 56, to\n                               which reference has been made by Mr Vijay Kumar, does not\n                               contain any provision in terms whereof any legal right as\n                               such is conferred upon an officer of the Society.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">                               10.

The State furthermore is not\n                               the majority shareholder. The State has the power only to\n                               nominate one Director. It cannot, thus, be said that the State\n                               exercises any functional control over the affairs of the\n                               Society in the sense that the majority Directors are nominated\n                               by the State. For arriving at the conclusion that the State has a\n                               deep and pervasive control over the Society, several other\n                               relevant questions are required to be considered, namely, (1)\n                               How was the Society created? (2) Whether it enjoys any\n                               monopoly character? (3) Do the functions of the Society\n                               partake to statutory functions or public functions? and (4)\n                               Can it be characterised as public authority?\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">                               11.
