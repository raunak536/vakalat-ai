Parties and documents are referred to in this\n\njudgment, unless otherwise mentioned, as they appear in W.P.\n\n(C) No.21463 of 2021.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_2\">            2.       On 17.09.2021, the Government in the Higher\n\nEducation Department, having regard to the fact that the\n\nrestrictions imposed in connection with the prevention of\n\nCovid-19 pandemic have been substantially relaxed, ordered to\n\nopen the higher education institutions including professional\n\ncolleges in the State with effect from 04.10.2021 for the final\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\"> W.P.(C) Nos.21120 &amp; 21463 of 2021      7</span>\n\n\nyear graduate students and post graduate students subject to\n\nthe conditions stipulated therein. In the light of the said\n\nGovernment Order, the Director of Collegiate Education, the\n\nfirst respondent, issued Ext.P1 circular on 01.10.2021 directing\n\nthat students, teachers and other staff members who have\n\ntaken two doses of Covid-19 vaccine or one dose of the vaccine\n\nbefore two weeks and those who have recovered from Covid-19\n\ninfection within the previous 90 days, shall be permitted to\n\nenter the educational institutions and their hostels. It is\n\nclarified, however, in Ext.P1 circular that those who are unable\n\nto take the vaccine on account of the health issues can also\n\nenter   the        educational   institutions   and   their   hostels   on\n\nproduction of medical certificates, indicating their inability to\n\ntake the vaccine.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_3\">              3.      On 02.10.2021, the second respondent, the\n\nChairman of the Executive Committee of the State Disaster\n\nManagement Authority issued Ext.P2 order in exercise of the\n\npowers under <a href=\"/doc/1664121/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 20(3)</a> of the Disaster Management Act,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\"> W.P.(C) Nos.21120 &amp; 21463 of 2021      8</span>\n\n\n2005 directing, among others, that regular classes in colleges\n\nand training institutions can be commenced with effect from\n\n18.10.2021 for students who have taken two doses of the\n\nvaccine by engaging teachers/trainers/other staff who have\n\ntaken two doses of the vaccine.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_4\">            4.    The      petitioners     are    students     undergoing\n\neducation in various colleges in the State. They have taken an\n\ninformed decision not to take the vaccine fearing adverse side\n\neffects. It is stated by the petitioners that the vaccine is not\n\ncompulsory and the right to life guaranteed to them under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_2\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India, especially the right to\n\nprivacy available to the petitioners also gives them freedom to\n\nabstain   from    taking    the     vaccine.     In   the   circumstances,\n\naccording to the petitioners, Ext.P1 circular of the first\n\nrespondent and Ext.P2 order of the second respondent are\n\nillegal and unconstitutional. The petitioners, therefore, seek\n\norders quashing Ext.P1 circular and Ext.P2 order to the extent\n\nthey restrict the students from continuing their education in the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\"> W.P.(C) Nos.21120 &amp; 21463 of 2021   9</span>\n\n\ncolleges, when the colleges reopen.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_5\">            5.    W.P.(C) No.21120 of 2021 is a writ petition\n\ninstituted by a few school teachers in the State challenging a\n\ncircular issued by the Director of General Education, the sixth\n\nrespondent in the said writ petition, identical to Ext.P1 circular,\n\ninsisting the teachers and other staff members of the schools in\n\nthe State to take two doses or at least one dose of the vaccine\n\non or before 16.09.2021. The grounds urged by the petitioners\n\nin this writ petition are identical to the grounds urged by the\n\npetitioners in W.P.(C) No.21463 of 2021. In addition, the\n\npetitioners in this case also allege that the said circular of the\n\nsixth respondent infringes the fundamental right guaranteed to\n\nthe petitioners under <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_3\">Article 19(1)(g)</a> of the Constitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_6\">            6.

The    learned    counsel   for   the   petitioners\n\nreiterated the case in the writ petitions and relied on the\n\ndecisions of the Apex Court in <a href=\"/doc/91938676/\" id=\"a_4\">K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\"> W.P.(C) Nos.21120 &amp; 21463 of 2021   10</span>\n\n\nIndia</a>, (<a href=\"/doc/235821/\" id=\"a_5\">2017) 10 SCC 1 and Aruna Ramachandra Shanbaug\n\nv. Union of India</a>, (2011) 4 SCC 454, in support of the same.</span></span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_8\">            8.    Per contra, the learned Government Pleader\n\ncontended at the outset that the questions raised by the\n\npetitioners in the writ petitions are covered against them by\n\nthe decision of the Division Bench of this Court in W.P.(C)\n\nNos.16614 of 2021 and 17274 of 2021. As regards the merits of\n\nthe matter, it was argued by the learned Government Pleader\n\nthat no fundamental right is absolute and in the interest of\n\ngeneral public, reasonable restrictions can be imposed by the\n\nGovernment. According to the learned Government Pleader,\n\nthe measures taken in terms of the impugned order and\n\ncirculars are only those taken in public interest to suppress the\n\nspread of Covid-19. It was also argued by the learned\n\nGovernment Pleader that the rights of individuals are always\n\nsubservient to public interest and the directions contained in\n\nthe impugned order and circulars being directions issued in\n\npublic interest, they cannot be impugned on the ground of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\"> W.P.(C) Nos.21120 &amp; 21463 of 2021     11</span>\n\n\nviolation of fundamental rights of the individuals.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_9\">            9.     I have considered the arguments of the learned\n\ncounsel for the parties on either side.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\">            10.    The decision of the Division Bench of this Court\n\ncited by the learned Government Pleader is a decision on two\n\nwrit   petitions   instituted     challenging,          among       others,      the\n\ndecisions of the competent authorities permitting entry in\n\npublic places for those who have taken the vaccine. The case of\n\nthe petitioners in the said writ petitions was that the impugned\n\ndecisions   are    discriminatory      and      that      persons        who     are\n\nvaccinated and unvaccinated are to be treated alike.

Across the globe, the\n                  executive has been given a wider margin in enacting\n                  measures which ordinarily may have violated the liberty of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\"> W.P.(C) Nos.21120 &amp; 21463 of 2021       20</span>\n\n\n                individuals, but are now incumbent to curb the pandemic.\n                Historically,   the   judiciary     has   also   recognized   that\n                constitutional scrutiny is transformed during such public\n                health emergencies, where the executive functions in rapid\n                consultation with scientists and other experts. In 1905, the\n                Supreme Court of the United States in               Jacobson v.\n                Massachusetts         197    U.<a href=\"/doc/129956/\" id=\"a_27\">S.   11    (1905)</a>,   considered   a\n                constitutional liberty challenge to a compulsory vaccination\n                law that was enacted to combat the smallpox epidemic.\n                Justice Harlan had noted the complex role of the government\n                in battling public health emergencies in the following terms:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">                           &quot;..the State may invest local bodies called into\n                           existence for purposes of local administration with\n                           authority in some appropriate way to safeguard\n                           the public health and the public safety... While this\n                           court should guard with firmness every right\n                           appertaining to life, liberty or property as secured\n                           to the individual by the Supreme Law of the Land,\n                           it is of the last importance that it should not\n                           invade the domain of local authority except when\n                           it is plainly necessary to do so in order to enforce\n                           that law.
