Learned advocate for the petitioners vehemently rested his\n         contention on <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution by submitting that\n         borrower&#x27;s right to privacy flowing from <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_2\">Article 21</a>, would stand\n         infringed if his photograph was to be published. He submitted that the\n         bank was not supposed to disclose the identity of the petitioners-\n         borrowers by publishing photograph, more particularly when neither in\n         the Act or in the Rules, such recourse is permissible. It was the emphatic\n         submission that by publishing photographs of the petitioners, the rights of\n         privacy and rights concomitant thereto, would be tinkered with.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_3\">         <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"67469801\" id=\"span_3\">3.      Though an interesting, but the question is covered in view of\n         judgment of this court dated 31st March, 2015 in <a href=\"/doc/67469801/\" id=\"a_3\">Monal Dineshbhai\n         Chokshi vs. State Bank of India</a> being Special Civil Application\n         No.8323 of 2013 and allied petitions. Therein, the court considered the\n         issue with regard to the powers of bank under <a href=\"/doc/52229129/\" id=\"a_4\">SARFAESI Act</a> to publish\n         the name with photograph of the borrower who has been a defaulter in\n         repayment of the outstanding dues of the bank.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_4\">         4.      The submissions on similar lines as are sought to be raised by\n         learned advocate for the petitioner in this case, were canvassed in the said\n         case,\n\n                 &quot;3.     The learned counsels have, referring to the right to life under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_5\">Art. 21</a>,\n                 emphasised that it encompasses right to live with dignity and therefore the\n                 reputation or dignity of the borrower who has defaulted in repayment cannot\n                 be prejudiced. The learned counsels have therefore pointedly referred to these\n                 provisions including some guidelines by the bank and alternatively it has also\n                 been argued that even if the power is assumed, it cannot have any unfettered\n                 power or discretion and therefore the guideline known as the Bank Codes and\n                 the Standards Board of India refers to the standards which include the privacy\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                                Page 2 of 6</span>\n\nHC-NIC                                       Page 2 of 6      Created On Sun Feb 28 03:54:53 IST 2016\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">              C/SCA/189/2015                                                  ORDER</span>\n\n\n\n         and confidentiality of the borrower as a customer. Therefore, it has also been\n         contended that the bank could not disclose or publish the photograph in view\n         of such guidelines with regard to privacy and confidentiality as they cannot\n         cause any harm to the reputation of the borrower by publishing information\n         and the photograph of the borrower. It was emphasised that as it has been\n         specifically stated in this Code that &quot;your privacy would be respected&quot; would\n         not justify any such publication of the photograph. The learned counsels have\n         have tried to emphasise that even if it is assumed for the sake of argument that\n         there is a power, still, it is subject to some mechanism or guideline and as\n         there is no detailed guideline with regard to the same by RBI, the photograph\n         could not be permitted to be published causing harm to the reputation of the\n         borrower. The learned counsels have submitted that merely because the\n         person may have committed a default in repayment he is not necessarily a\n         person without reputation. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"847250\" id=\"span_6\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1392447\" id=\"span_7\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1885881\" id=\"span_8\">In support of these submissions, they have\n         referred to and relied upon the judgments of the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court reported\n         in AIR 1996 SC 2124 in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1885881/\" id=\"a_6\">State of Manipur v. Thingujam Brojen\n         Meetei</a>, (1996) 11 SCC 399 in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1392447/\" id=\"a_7\">Om Prakash Gargi v.

Mandal Revenue Officer, Andhra Pradesh</a> and the\n         judgment reported in 2014(1) DRTC 93 (Ker).</span></span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_5\">         4.      Per contra, the learned counsels appearing for the banks contended\n         that there is no right, much less any fundamental right. It was submitted that\n         the publication of such photograph along with the notice is in exercise of\n         statutory right as provided under the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/52229129/\" id=\"a_9\">SARFAESI Act</a>. They\n         have pointedly referred to the notice under <a href=\"/doc/122562177/\" id=\"a_10\">sec.13(2)</a> of SARFAESI Act read\n         with the Rules and submitted that it clearly provides for taking action for\n         recovery of the dues. Merely because it is not expressly stated about\n         publication of notice with photograph it does not necessarily mean that every\n         detail has to be provided in the statute itself about the mode or the manner of\n         publication of the notice. The learned counsels have submitted that the notice\n         may include the notice with photograph as in these days in many cases\n         photograph is required to be affixed to the forms like the account opening\n         form, etc. It was submitted that when the statute provides and it does not\n         expressly prohibit it can hardly be said that there is any breach or violation of\n         any right. The learned counsels have stated that therefore the manner and\n         modalities of publication of notice cannot be an issue once the statute\n         empowers the bank to publish such notice. It was submitted that it gives right\n         to the bank, provides an opportunity to the borrower to comply with the notice\n         and at the same time the published notice also puts the public at large to notice\n         about the property in question which is involved and which is mortgaged to\n         the bank as a security. It was therefore submitted that it is in public interest\n         and so long as it is not offending or prohibited by any law or rules the\n         exercise of statutory powers by the bank cannot be curtailed or regulated in\n         exercise of discretion under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_11\">Art. 226</a> by the court. The manner of publication\n         of notice cannot be questioned before the court in exercise of discretion under\n         <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_12\">Art. 226.</a>\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                         Page 3 of 6</span>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_6\">HC-NIC                                Page 3 of 6      Created On Sun Feb 28 03:54:53 IST 2016\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                      C/SCA/189/2015                                                 ORDER</span>\n\n\n\n               .................\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_7\">               9.      Learned Sr. Counsel Shri Nanavati referred to the papers and pointedly\n               referred to the Banking Codes and Standards Board of India (for short &#x27;the\n               Codes&#x27;) which is produced on record and submitted that it also includes a\n               clause/para regarding privacy and confidentiality. Learned Sr. Counsel Shri\n               Nanavati has pointedly referred to this and submitted that the bank has\n               evolved this guideline to protect the reputation of the borrower who has\n               defaulted and it has been specifically observed,\n\n                                 &quot;Your privacy would be respected&quot;\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">               <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"176333521\" id=\"span_11\">He, therefore, submitted that the &#x27;Codes&#x27; provide for a broad code of conduct\n               for both the bank as well as the borrower. He submitted that the clause\n               regarding privacy and confidentiality would be meaningless if such notice\n               with photograph is permitted to be published. He has referred to and relied\n               upon the judgment of the Kerala High Court reported in [(2014) (1) DRTC 93\n               (Ker.)] in the case of <a href=\"/doc/176333521/\" id=\"a_13\">Venu v. State Bank of India</a> to emphasise the\n               observation,\n\n               &quot;...The practice of exhibiting a photograph of a person and shaming him in\n               public for the sin of being in an impecunious condition cannot be encouraged\n               in a civilised society like ours.&quot;</span>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_8\">               He has also referred to other judgments and submitted that apart from the\n               challenge to the power the court may also consider the alternative argument\n               whether there is any justification to publish the notice with photograph.&quot;\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_9\">         4.1   The court answered the contentions as under,\n\n               &quot;22. There are divergent views on this issue with regard to publication of\n               photograph and the powers of the bank to publish notice with photograph.\n               The Kerala High Court has decided that it is not permissible as it entrenches\n               upon the right to life under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_14\">Art. 21</a> as it has an impact on the reputation of the\n               borrower, whereas the Hon&#x27;ble High Courts of Madras and Madhya Pradesh\n               have taken different views with specific observations referring to this very\n               aspect. The High Court of Bombay in a judgment in the case of D.J. Exim\n               (India) Pvt Ltd. &amp; ors. (supra) has focused on this very issue with reference to\n               <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_15\">Art. 21</a> and right to reputation or right to privacy.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_10\">               .................\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_11\">               29.     It is required to be mentioned that the fact that the publication of notice\n               with photograph has a social impact and perhaps that is the reason the\n               defaulters/borrowers like the petitioners are more concerned which in turn is\n               indication of the fact that it is a more effective measure for recovery as the\n               person would like to have his reputation protected and therefore would clear\n               the outstanding dues and would not make the default. Therefore, though the\n               submissions have been made that it is arm-twisting it could not be readily\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                                Page 4 of 6</span>\n\nHC-NIC                                       Page 4 of 6      Created On Sun Feb 28 03:54:53 IST 2016\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                   C/SCA/189/2015                                                  ORDER</span>\n\n\n\n              accepted. In fact, it is rather an effective remedy as it has a reference to some\n              kind of social impact. It is required to be mentioned at this stage that even for\n              criminal justice system the theory of reformation or deterrence have advocated\n              about social impact or social sanction being imposed which could be more\n              effective.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\">              <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"793946\" id=\"span_14\">30.     A useful reference can be made to the observations made by the\n              Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court in the case of R. Rajagopal (supra) and relied upon in the\n              case of <a href=\"/doc/793946/\" id=\"a_16\">Phoolan Devi v. Shekhar Kapoor</a>, reported in (1995) 57 DLT 154 :</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">              (1995) 32 DRJ 142.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">              31.     It is also required to be considered with reference to the right of the\n              bank or financial institution to protect its outstanding dues and also as a\n              public body having a public duty of passing information to the general public\n              with regard to the financial transaction of the defaulters like the petitioners. In\n              fact, the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_17\">Right to Information Act</a> has been made for granting more\n              information to the public at large. In the facts of the case, such information\n              may not be given individually but when the bank in exercise of its statutory\n              powers or under an agreement is obliged to give a notice it cannot be\n              interpreted narrowly that it has a right to publish the notice but it does not\n              necessarily mean with photograph. In fact, it is one of the modes of\n              publication and the public notice with or without photograph is a matter which\n              is better left to the institution rather than the court intervening.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">              32.      One more aspect which is required to be considered is, as rightly\n              submitted by learned advocate Ms. Raval, that the RBI is having a master\n              circular by way of guideline which provides for internal mechanism to have\n              some scrutiny before such publication. It has been pointed out that it is not\n              that in case of every defaulter it is published with photographs and care has\n              been taken so that it does not affect the reputation of a person though he is a\n              borrower who has defaulted. It provides that the papers would be placed and\n              only with the approval of Chief Manager it could be published and there is a\n              committee also which would scrutinize the papers. This itself suggests that\n              even the exercise of discretion under an agreement is guided by some norms\n              or mechanism. In other words, even though the borrower has agreed\n              unconditionally and the bank having unqualified right to give publication of\n              notice with photograph that there have to be in place some mechanism so that\n              it is not exercised in every case. Therefore, it is in this background the court\n              would not be justified to interfere with such discretion in exercise of discretion\n              under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_18\">Art. 226.</a>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\">              33.    The scope of judicial review in exercise of discretion under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_19\">Art.226</a> is\n              well defined and broad guidelines have been <a href=\"/doc/793946/\" id=\"a_20\">laid down by</a> the Hon&#x27;ble Apex\n              Court in this regard. Though the concept of judicial review refers to the\n              exercise of such power or judicial review with care and circumspection,\n              meaning thereby, it is not a case of lack of jurisdiction but rather a caution and\n              self-imposed limitation before exercising such discretion.&quot;\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_16\">         5.
