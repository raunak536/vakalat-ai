No. 22075 of 2021 (<a href=\"/doc/18639342/\" id=\"a_1\">K.\n\nUmadevi Vs. Government of Tamil Nadu and Others</a>) whereby\n\ndirection was issued to the State to sanction maternity leave to\n\nthe appellant. By reversing the aforesaid decision, Division\n\nBench held that appellant was not entitled to the benefit of\n\nmaternity leave as claimed by her.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">3.        Relevant facts may be briefly noted.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">4.        Appellant married A. Suresh in the year 2006. From\n\nthe said wedlock, two children were born: first one in 2007 and\n\nthe second one in 2011. She entered government service in\n\nDecember, 2012 as English Teacher in Government Higher\n\nSecondary School, P. Gollapatti, Dharmapuri District in the\n\nState of Tamil Nadu. Marriage between the two was dissolved in\n\nthe year 2017. It is stated that the two children born out of the\n\nsaid wedlock are in the custody of the former husband.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                             2</span>\n\f4.1.        On 12.09.2018, appellant married M. Rajkumar. Due\n\nto conceivement from her second marriage, appellant applied\n\nfor grant of maternity leave to the authorities for the period from\n\n17.08.2021 to 13.05.2022 (nine months) which was inclusive of\n\nboth pre-and-post-natal periods.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">4.2.        The third respondent vide order dated 28.08.2021\n\nrejected the prayer of the appellant. It was stated that as\n\nper Fundamental Rule (FR) 101(a) which is applicable to state\n\ngovernment employees of Tamil Nadu, maternity leave is\n\navailable to women state government employees having less\n\nthan two surviving children. There is no provision for grant of\n\nmaternity leave for the third child on account of appellant’s re-\n\nmarriage.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">4.3.        Aggrieved by rejection of her request for grant of\n\nmaternity leave, appellant preferred a writ petition before the\n\nHigh Court which was registered as W.P. No. 22075 of 2021. A\n\nlearned Single Judge of the High Court vide the judgment and\n\norder dated 25.03.2022 held that appellant was entitled to grant\n\nof maternity benefit. Therefore, rejection of her claim for grant\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                              3</span>\n\fof such benefit was illegal. As such, order dated 28.08.2021 was\n\nset aside. Respondents were directed to sanction maternity\n\nleave to the appellant as admissible in terms of the latest\n\nG.O.Ms. No. 84 of the Personnel and Administrative Reforms\n\n(FR-III) Department dated 23.08.2021. Consequential decision\n\nwas directed to be taken within a period of two weeks from the\n\ndate of receipt of a copy of <a href=\"/doc/18639342/\" id=\"a_2\">the said judgment</a>. Writ petition was\n\naccordingly allowed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_9\">4.4.      Government of Tamil Nadu and its officers filed intra-\n\ncourt appeal being W.A. No. 1442 of 2022. A Division Bench of\n\nthe High Court vide the impugned judgment and order dated\n\n14.09.2022 found the judgment of the learned Single Judge to\n\nbe unsustainable. Division Bench held that the appellant was\n\nnot entitled to maternity relief as claimed by her. Accordingly,\n\nthe judgment and order of the learned Single Judge dated\n\n25.03.2022 has been set aside. Consequently, the writ appeal\n\nhas been allowed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\">5.        This came to be assailed before this Court in the\n\nrelated special leave petition. Notice was issued by this Court\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                             4</span>\n\f          on 28.11.2022. In the hearing held on 11.02.2025, leave was\n\n          granted.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_11\">          6.            Learned counsel for the appellant submits that the\n\n          Division Bench was not at all justified in reversing the decision\n\n          of the learned Single Judge. Division Bench erred in holding\n\n          that maternity benefit could not be provided to the appellant.\n\n          Prior to her entry into service, she had begotten two children\n\n          from her first marriage but their custody is with the father.\n\n          Conceivement of a child out of her re-marriage which, in fact, is\n\n          her first child from the present wedlock cannot be treated as\n\n          her third child, thus, disentitling her from availing the benefit\n\n          of maternity leave.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\">          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"26134676\" id=\"span_11\">6.1.          Learned counsel submits that the issue raised in this\n\n          case is squarely covered by the decision of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/26134676/\" id=\"a_3\">Deepika\n\n          Singh Vs. Central Administrative Tribunal1</a>. However, the\n\n          Division Bench misdirected itself in observing that <a href=\"/doc/26134676/\" id=\"a_4\">the said\n\n          decision</a> is not applicable to the facts of this case; rather\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">1</span>\n    (2023) 13 SCC 681\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                                          5</span>\n\fsupports the case of the respondents.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"26134676\" id=\"span_14\">He submits that the\n\ndecision of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/26134676/\" id=\"a_5\">Deepika Singh</a> (supra) is squarely\n\napplicable to the facts of this case.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"26134676\" id=\"span_15\">Division Bench of the High\n\nCourt is bound by the dictum of law <a href=\"/doc/26134676/\" id=\"a_6\">laid down in</a> <a href=\"/doc/26134676/\" id=\"a_7\">Deepika Singh</a>\n\n(supra). To that extent, impugned judgment and order suffers\n\nfrom perversity.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_13\">6.2.       Learned counsel further submits that view of the\n\nDivision Bench that grant of maternity leave is not a\n\nfundamental right is totally unsustainable. Right to have\n\nmaternity leave is a facet of reproductive right of a woman which\n\nis traceable to <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_8\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India, he\n\nsubmits.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_14\">6.3.       He further submits that though the <a href=\"/doc/600217/\" id=\"a_9\">Maternity Benefit\n\nAct, 1961</a> may not be directly applicable to the state government\n\nemployees, nonetheless for the purpose of adopting an\n\napproach which would further the legislative intent, certainly\n\nguidance can be derived from the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/600217/\" id=\"a_10\">Maternity\n\nBenefit Act, 1961</a> (referred to hereinafter as the ‘<a href=\"/doc/600217/\" id=\"a_11\">Maternity\n\nBenefit Act</a>’).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_15\">\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                             6</span>\n\f6.4.      In any view of the matter, he submits that view taken\n\nby the Division Bench cannot be sustained. Learned Single\n\nJudge was justified in holding that appellant is entitled to\n\nmaternity leave. Therefore, the impugned judgment should be\n\nset aside and direction be issued to the respondents to grant\n\nmaternity leave to the appellant or regularize any leave taken by\n\nthe appellant relatable to her pregnancy as maternity leave of\n\nthe appellant.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_16\">7.        Per contra, learned counsel for the respondents\n\nsubmits that the entire object of maternity benefit is to protect\n\nthe dignity of motherhood by providing complete care to a\n\nwoman employee and her children when she is unable to\n\nperform her duty on account of her pregnancy. By extending\n\nsuch benefit, the State has made an attempt to provide the\n\nwomen employees with a level playing field.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_17\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"26134676\" id=\"span_17\">7.1.      He, however, submits that the said policy is subject\n\nto fiscal responsibility and human resources management. Any\n\ndeviation from the established policy of not extending the\n\nbenefit of maternity leave to women employees having more\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                             7</span>\n\fthan two children would create precedents that could\n\npotentially overwhelm the exchequer and impact administrative\n\nefficacy. Even in <a href=\"/doc/26134676/\" id=\"a_12\">Deepika Singh</a> (supra), this Court highlighted\n\nthat statutory rights and service conditions must align.\n\nTherefore, personal circumstances cannot override established\n\npolicy, especially where fiscal implications are significant.\n\n7.2.       He also submits that it is the policy of the State to\n\nespouse the cause of small family which is in sync with the\n\npolicy of Government of India on population control. If the\n\nreliefs sought for by the appellant is granted, it would amount\n\nto incentivizing breach of population control norms and may\n\nhave severe and adverse impact on government’s policy of\n\nmanaging small family norms as a population control measure.\n\n7.3.       Learned counsel has referred to FR 101(a) and\n\nsubmits that the same bars grant of maternity benefit beyond\n\nthe second child. Permanent married women government\n\nservants and non-permanent married women government\n\nservants may be granted maternity leave with less than two\n\nsurviving children or with two surviving children born as twins\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                              8</span>\n\fin the first delivery. Insofar the present case is concerned,\n\nappellant already has two children from her first marriage.\n\nTherefore, she is not entitled to maternity benefit for the third\n\nchild. That apart, provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/600217/\" id=\"a_13\">Maternity Benefit Act</a> are\n\nnot applicable to state government employees like the appellant.\n\nHowever, benefits extended to government employees of Tamil\n\nNadu as social welfare measures are more beneficial than under\n\nthe <a href=\"/doc/600217/\" id=\"a_14\">Maternity Benefit Act</a>.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_18\">7.4.      Learned counsel submits that appeal of the appellant\n\nis without any merit and, therefore, the same is liable to be\n\ndismissed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_19\">8.        We have considered the rival submissions of the\n\nlearned counsel representing the parties.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_20\">9.        Let us first deal with the order dated 28.08.2021\n\npassed by the third respondent under the heading: Proceeding\n\nof Dharmapuri District Chief Educational Officer. By the\n\naforesaid order, request of the appellant for maternity leave was\n\nrejected on the ground that there is no provision in the Tamil\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                             9</span>\n\fNadu Fundamental Rules for grant of maternity leave for third\n\nchild through re-marriage. Order dated 28.08.2021 reads thus:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">           On the above subject matter, the letter in the\n      reference cited was received on 18.08.2021 in this office.\n      Smt. K. Umadevi had two children by her first marriage.\n      After getting divorced for personal reason, she remarried\n      and through remarriage she has now applied for\n      maternity leave for the third child from 17.08.2021.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">           Since as per Rule 101 (a) of the Tamil Nadu\n      Fundamental Rules, maternity leave can be granted to a\n      woman government servant with less than two living\n      children only, the request of the individual to sanction\n      maternity leave to her third child may be rejected by\n      informing that there is no provision in the Tamil Nadu\n      Fundamental rules for grant of maternity leave for third\n      child through remarriage.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_21\">10.        When this was challenged before the High Court,\n\nlearned Single Judge referred to various case laws and also\n\nrelied upon the <a href=\"/doc/600217/\" id=\"a_15\">Maternity Benefit Act</a> and held that provisions\n\nof the <a href=\"/doc/600217/\" id=\"a_16\">Maternity Benefit Act</a> have overriding effect on any other\n\nlaw inconsistent therewith. It was held that the rule providing\n\ncap on the number of children for entitlement of maternity\n\nbenefit is repugnant to the <a href=\"/doc/600217/\" id=\"a_17\">Maternity Benefit Act</a> which is a\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">                               10</span>\n\fcentral enactment. Further, two surviving children must mean\n\nchildren in lawful custody of the mother. Appellant was not\n\nhaving the custody of children born from the first wedlock. A\n\nsemantic construct of the expression ‘having surviving children’\n\nmust mean that the woman government employee seeking\n\nmaternity benefit should have custody of the children. The\n\nthrust should be on grant of the benefit by adopting a liberal\n\ninterpretation. Learned Single Judge also noted that the State\n\nGovernment had issued G.O.Ms. No. 84 dated 23.08.2021\n\nenhancing maternity leave from 9 months to 12 months\n\nunderlying the importance of maternity leave. Therefore,\n\nlearned Single Judge concluded that rejection of the claim of the\n\nappellant for maternity leave was wholly unjustified. Vide the\n\njudgment and order of the learned Single Judge dated\n\n25.03.2022,    order   dated     28.08.2021   was    set   aside.\n\nRespondents were directed to sanction maternity leave to the\n\nappellant for the period from 11.10.2021 to 10.10.2022 as\n\nadmissible in terms of the latest G.O.Ms. No. 84 dated\n\n23.08.2021.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_22\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">                            11</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_23\">\f11.        When the aforesaid judgment and order of the\n\nlearned Single Judge was assailed in intra-court appeal,\n\nDivision Bench noted that insofar policy of the State is\n\nconcerned it restricts benefit of maternity leave to two children.\n\nTherefore, appellant was not entitled to benefit of maternity\n\nleave for the third child. Grant of maternity leave is not a\n\nfundamental right. It is either a statutory right or a right which\n\nflows from the conditions of service. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"26134676\" id=\"span_23\">Insofar the decision of this\n\nCourt in <a href=\"/doc/26134676/\" id=\"a_18\">Deepika Singh</a> (supra) is concerned, Division Bench\n\nobserved that <a href=\"/doc/26134676/\" id=\"a_19\">the said decision</a> supports the case of the State,\n\nparticularly paragraph 17 thereof. In the circumstances,\n\nDivision Bench vide the impugned judgment held that appellant\n\nwas not entitled to the relief as claimed by her. Consequently,\n\nwhile allowing the writ appeal, judgment and order of the\n\nlearned Single Judge has been set aside.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">12.        We need to examine the correctness or otherwise of\n\nthe decision of the Division Bench in the light of constitutional\n\nand statutory framework as well as in the backdrop of\n\ninternational developments.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_25\">\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                              12</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_26\">\f13.          <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_20\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India though at first\n\nblush appears to be a colourless article, it is a potent provision\n\npregnant with wide width and scope having received extensive\n\nand liberal construction at the hands of this Court. <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_21\">Article 21</a>\n\nreads thus:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">        21.

Maternity leave is integral to maternity\n\n          benefits. Reproductive rights are now recognized as part of\n\n          several intersecting domains of international human rights law\n\n          viz. the right to health, right to privacy, right to equality and\n\n          non-discrimination and the right to dignity.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_48\">          29.

Reproductive health has\n     been defined as “the capability to reproduce and the\n     freedom   to    make        informed,   free    and   responsible\n     decisions.

It also includes the\n\n          constellation of freedoms and entitlements that enable a woman\n\n          to decide freely on all matters relating to her sexual and\n\n          reproductive health. This Court observed that although human\n\n          dignity inheres in every individual, it is susceptible to violation\n\n          by external conditions and treatment imposed by the State.

Deprivation of access to reproductive healthcare\n\nor emotional and physical well-being also injures the dignity of\n\nwomen. This Court referred to <a href=\"/doc/854952/\" id=\"a_63\">Article 51</a> of the Constitution\n\nwhich urges the State to foster respect for international law and\n\ntreaty obligations. Relevant extract of <a href=\"/doc/123985596/\" id=\"a_64\">the said decision</a> reads\n\nthus:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">        101.

In   a   recent   decision,    Delhi   High    Court   in\n\n         Commissioner of Police Vs. Raveena Yadav6 explained the\n\n         purpose of maternity benefit. It is to ensure that a working lady\n\n         may overcome the state of motherhood honourably, peaceably\n\n         and undeterred by the fear of being victimized for forced\n\n         absence from work during pre and post natal periods. Women\n\n         now constituting a sizable portion of the work force in our\n\n         country, must be treated with honour and dignity at places\n\n         where they work to earn their livelihood. The High Court went\n\n         on to explain the impact of pregnancy on the physiological and\n\n         psychological       state   of   a    woman    employee      undergoing\n\n         pregnancy. It is not just motherhood but also childhood that\n\n         require special attention. Health issues of both mother as well\n\n         as that of the child are to be kept in consideration while\n\n         providing maternity leave. Concept of maternity leave is a\n\n         matter of not just fair play and social justice but is also a\n\n         constitutional guarantee to the women employees of this\n\n         country towards fulfillment whereof the State is bound to act.\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_53\">6</span>\n    MANU/DE/4823/2024\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_54\">                                          32</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_59\">\f33.        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"26134676\" id=\"span_55\">In <a href=\"/doc/26134676/\" id=\"a_65\">Deepika Singh</a> (supra), appellant at the material\n\ntime was working as a nursing officer in the Post Graduate\n\nInstitute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh\n\n(PGIMER). Her spouse had two children from his first marriage.\n\nAfter his first wife passed away he married the appellant. In\n\nofficial record she declared the two children of her spouse from\n\nthe first marriage as her children. On 04.06.2019 she had her\n\nfirst biological child from her marriage. She applied for\n\nmaternity leave in terms of Rule 43 of the Central Services\n\n(Leave) Rules, 1972 (‘1972 Rules’ hereinafter) which rules are\n\napplicable to PGIMER. Request of the appellant for grant of\n\nmaternity leave was rejected on the ground that she had two\n\nsurviving children and had availed of child care leave earlier for\n\nthe two children born from the first marriage of her spouse. Her\n\nfirst biological child was considered as the third child. Therefore\n\nher request for grant of maternity leave was found to be\n\ninadmissible in terms of the 1972 Rules.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_60\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"26134676\" id=\"span_56\">33.1.      Appellant challenged <a href=\"/doc/26134676/\" id=\"a_66\">the said decision</a> before the\n\nCentral Administrative Tribunal, Chandigarh Bench (Tribunal).\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_57\">                             33</span>\n\fHowever, her original application was dismissed by the\n\nTribunal. When the appellant moved the High Court calling into\n\nquestion the decision of the Tribunal, High Court also dismissed\n\nthe same on the ground that there was no perversity or illegality\n\nin the judgment of the Tribunal.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_61\">33.2.      Thereafter, the matter travelled to this Court. This\n\nCourt referred to Rule 43 of the 1972 Rules which deals with\n\nmaternity leave. As per Rule 43(1), only a female Government\n\nservant with less than two surviving children may be granted\n\nmaternity leave. This Court opined that provisions of Rule 43(1)\n\nmust be imbued with a purposive construction. Since it is a\n\nbeneficial legislation, it has to be construed with a purpose\n\noriented approach and must receive a liberal construction to\n\npromote its objects. The courts must bridge the gap between\n\nlaw and society through the use of purposive interpretation.\n\nThough this Court acknowledged that the <a href=\"/doc/600217/\" id=\"a_67\">Maternity Benefit Act</a>\n\nhas no application to PGIMER as an establishment, yet for the\n\npurpose of adopting an approach which furthers legislative\n\npolicy, referred to the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/600217/\" id=\"a_68\">Maternity Benefit Act</a> to\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_58\">                             34</span>\n\fderive some guidance therefrom. After an exhaustive analysis of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1130021/\" id=\"a_69\">Section 5</a> of the Maternity Benefit Act, this Court observed that\n\nthe said Act was enacted to secure women’s right to maternity\n\nleave and to afford women with as much flexibility as possible\n\nto live an autonomous life, both as a mother and as a worker.\n\nThereafter, this Court referred to the various international\n\ntreaties and conventions.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_62\">33.3.        In the facts of that case, this Court observed that\n\nspouse of the appellant had a prior marriage which had ended\n\nas a result of the death of his wife after which the appellant\n\nmarried him. However, what is relevant and important is the\n\nfollowing declaration of this Court:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">             24.   …….The fact that the appellant’s spouse had\n        two biological children from his first marriage would not\n        impinge upon the entitlement of the appellant to avail\n        maternity leave for her sole biological child……\n\n\n33.4.        Thus, this Court was categorical in declaring that the\n\nfactum of appellant’s spouse having two biological children from\n\nhis first marriage would not impinge upon the entitlement of the\n\nappellant to avail maternity leave for her sole biological child.\n</blockquote>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_59\">                                35</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_63\">\fGrant of child care leave to the appellant for the two children of\n\nher spouse from his previous marriage cannot be used to\n\ndisentitle her to maternity leave under Rule 43 of the 1972\n\nRules. In the context of employment, child birth has to be\n\nconstrued as a natural incident of life and, hence, provisions for\n\nmaternity leave must be construed in that perspective.\n\nObserving that when courts are confronted with such\n\nsituations, they would do well to attempt to give effect to the\n\npurpose of the law in question rather than to prevent its\n\napplication.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_64\">34.        Insofar the present case is concerned it is true that\n\nappellant has two biological children out of her first wedlock.\n\nBut that was before entry into her service. Post entry into\n\nservice and from her subsisting marriage, this is her first child.\n\nIt has come on record that the two children out of her first\n\nwedlock are not residing with her but with their father, who is\n\nhaving their custody.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_65\">35.        Policy of the State to arrest population growth by\n\nresorting to various population control measures is certainly a\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_60\">                             36</span>\n\flaudable objective. So is the objective of granting maternity\n\nbenefit to women employees. The object of having two child\n\nnorm as part of the measures to control population growth in\n\nthe country and the object of providing maternity benefit to\n\nwomen employees including maternity leave in circumstances\n\nsuch as in the present case are not mutually exclusive. The two\n\nmust be harmonized in a purposive and rationale manner to\n\nachieve the social objective.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_66\">36.        In the circumstances, we are unable to agree with the\n\nview taken by the Division Bench of the High Court. Though\n\nlearned Single Judge had granted the relief to the appellant, we\n\nare also unable to persuade ourselves to the line of reasoning of\n\nthe learned Single Judge.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_67\">37.        We accordingly set aside the judgment and order of\n\nthe Division Bench of the High Court dated 14.09.2022 and\n\ndeclare that appellant shall be granted maternity leave under\n\nFR 101(a). Maternity benefits which are admissible to the\n\nappellant shall be released to her within a period of two months\n\nfrom today.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_68\">\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_61\">                                37</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_69\">\f38.
