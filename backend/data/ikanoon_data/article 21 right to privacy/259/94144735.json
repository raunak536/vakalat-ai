In\n\nthe light of the suit having been dismissed for want of adequate\n\nevidence regarding the relationship of the plaintiffs with the first\n\ndefendant and especially as regards the paternity of plaintiffs no.2\n\nand 3, an application under Order XXVI Rule 10-A <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_6\">of the Code of\n\nCivil Procedure</a>, 1908 (Hereinafter referred to as the &quot;<a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_7\">CPC</a>&quot;, for\n\nbrevity) was said to have been filed, seeking the appointment of a\n\nCommissioner for collection of DNA samples of the concerned\n\nnamely, the petitioner and respondents 2 and 3 herein, to\n\ndetermine their paternity. That application having been allowed,\n\nthe petitioner is aggrieved and the present petition is filed.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                   5</span>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_2\">      2. The learned counsel for the petitioner would contend\n\nthat the court below has allowed the above application without\n\nregard to the serious and sensitive nature of the proposed\n\ninvestigation, which is a direct violation of the petitioner&#x27;s\n\nfundamental right under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_8\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_3\">      It is contended that the plaintiffs, who are claiming to be the\n\nwife and daughters of the petitioner are aged 48, 24 and 22,\n\nrespectively, and it is hence inexplicable that they were unable to\n\nproduce any kind of documentary evidence to even remotely\n\nestablish that the petitioner and the first plaintiff had lived\n\ntogether as husband and wife, over the decades and that the other\n\nplaintiffs were born to them.          It is therefore unjust and\n\nobjectionable that the petitioner be subjected to any scientific\n\ninvestigation, against his will and when the respondents 1 to 3\n\nhave miserably failed to establish their case. It is contended that it\n\nis not a circumstance that though there was some evidence of a\n\npossible relationship, since there was some doubt created in the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                   6</span>\n\n\n\nmind of the court, which had prompted it to make the\n\nappointment, and seeks that the impugned order be set at naught.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_4\">       3. The learned counsel for the respondents, however, seeks\n\nto justify the impugned order.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_5\">       4. It is noticed by this court that since recently courts have\n\nbeen routinely directing that parties be subjected to DNA tests\n\nand analysis.    It is therefore necessary to revisit the topic as\n\nunderstood scientifically and the circumstances under which\n\nrecourse should be had to the said measure, as expressed by the\n\nApex court from time to time, to address whether the impugned\n\norder can indeed be justified.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_6\">DNA\n\n       Nearly all living things are composed of highly organized\n\nstructures called cells.   Every cell is made mostly of liquid\n\nprotected by a thin membrane. The nucleus is the central part\n\nof the cell.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                  7</span>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_7\">      Almost all the cells in an organism carry a complete copy\n\nof that organism&#x27;s Deoxyribose nucleic acid - or DNA, for\n\nbrevity. Nucleic acids are of two kinds, named according to the\n\ntype of sugar with which they are associated - ribose and\n\ndeoxyribose. In organisms which have a separate cell nucleus,\n\nribose nucleic acid, or RNA, for brevity, is found in both the\n\nnucleus and the cytoplasm, the       viscous fluid consisting of\n\nwater and complex molecules surrounding the nucleus, whereas\n\nDNA is found only in the nucleus.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">       Inside the nucleus of the human cell there are 46 long\n\ninvisible strands of DNA, the chromosomes. A chromosome is a\n\nlong strand of tightly wound DNA, like a ladder twisted into a\n\nhelix, carrying genes along its length. Genes are hereditary\n\nparticles ,they are records of biological history, each gene has the\n\ninformation to produce a functional product. The rungs of the\n\nladder are made up of chemical compounds called bases, two per\n\nrung (called a base pair). There are four different types of base\n\navailable (adenine, thymine, cytosine and guanine).\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                  8</span>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_9\">DNA as &quot; Blue Print&quot;\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">       Although deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was discovered\n\nin 1868, scientists were slow to understand its role in heredity.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">During the early 1950s, James Watson and Francis Crick\n\ndeduced the structure of DNA, ushering in a new era in the\n\nstudy of genetics. They found that adenine could pair only with\n\nthymine, while guanine could pair only with cytosine. This\n\nthey saw enabled DNA to divide and yet produce perfect copies\n\nof itself, and that the order of the bases along the molecule\n\ncould contain the genetic information.      Such developments\n\nwere seemingly of pheripheral interest to forensic scientists\n\nuntil 1985, when research into the structure of the human gene\n\nby Alec Jeffreys and his colleagues at Leicester University,\n\nEngland, led to the discovery that portions of the DNA structure\n\nof certain genes can be as unique to individuals as are\n\nfingerprints. According to Jeffreys, the chance of two persons\n\nhaving identical DNA patterns is between 30 billion and 100\n\nbillion to 1.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                 9</span>\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">      In all life forms - with the exception of a few viruses - the\n\nbasis for variation lies in genetic material called DNA. This DNA\n\nis a chemical &quot;blueprint&quot; that determines everything from hair\n\ncolour to susceptibility to diseases. In every cell of the same\n\nhuman that contains DNA, this blueprint is identical, whether the\n\nmaterial is blood, tissue, spermatozoa, bone marrow, tooth pulp,\n\nsaliva, or a hair root cell. Thus, with the exception of identical\n\ntwins, every person has distinctive DNA.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">The Enderby Cases\n\n      The first use of DNA in a criminal case was in 1987 in\n\nEngland. In 1983 Lynda Mann, age 15, was raped and murdered\n\nnear the village of Enderby. This case was unsolved. Three years\n\nlater, another 15-year-old, Dawn Ashworth, was a victim in a\n\nsimilar offense. Comparing the DNA &quot;fingerprints&quot; derived from\n\nsemen recovered from both victim&#x27;s bodies, investigators realized\n\nthat the same man had raped and killed both women. A 17-year-\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">old man was initially arrested and a sample of his blood was\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                 10</span>\n\n\n\nsubject to DNA analysis. This man&#x27;s innocence, however, was\n\nclearly established by the lack of a DNA match, and he was\n\nreleased. Subsequently, all males in the Enderby area between 13\n\nand 30 years of age were asked by the police to voluntarily\n\nprovide blood samples for DNA typing. Of 5,500 men living in\n\nthe area, all but two complied with the request. A man then came\n\nforward and told the police that he had used false identification to\n\nsupply a blood sample in the name of a friend. This friend, Colin\n\nPitchfork, was subsequently arrested and convicted of Ashworth&#x27;s\n\nmurder, with DNA        evidence playing a crucial role in the\n\nprosecution&#x27;s case.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">DNA Analysis\n\n      Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) consists of molecules that\n\ncarry the body&#x27;s genetic information and establish each person as\n\nseparate and distinct. Until recently, DNA was found primarily\n\nwithin the nuclei of cells in the Chromosomes. DNA can now be\n\nextracted and processed from blood, tissue, spermatozoa, bone\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                  11</span>\n\n\n\nmarrow, hair roots, saliva, skin cells, urine, feces, and a host of\n\nother biological specimens, all of which may be found at crime\n\nscenes.   DNA has been recovered from fingerprints, cigarette\n\nbutts, drinking cups, and hatbands and other articles of clothing.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">      DNA is generally found in cells that have a nucleus, hence\n\nthe name nuclear DNA. However, some biological cells do not\n\nhave nuclei, such as those forming fingernails, hair shafts, and\n\nteeth. What those cells do have is a more primitive form of\n\ngenetic coding called mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), found in\n\nthe mitochondria, which are in the body of the cell. When a sperm\n\nand an egg join at conception, the new individual gets half of his\n\nor her nuclear genetic information from each parent. Conversely,\n\nmitochondrial DNA is inherited only from the mother.                 At\n\nconception, all of the new person&#x27;s mitochondria come from the\n\nmother.   Since mitochondrial DNA is passed directly through\n\nmaternal relatives, it serves as a perfect identity marker for those\n\nrelatives. Indeed, the mitochondrial- DNA sequencing technique\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                12</span>\n\n\n\nwas originally developed by anthropologists to help trace human\n\nancestors.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">      Initially, DNA analysis required a fairly large sample, and\n\nthe manual processing technique, called Restriction Fragment\n\nLength Polymorphism (RFLP), took up to 14 weeks, on average,\n\nto produce results. The RFLP system is slow but produces good\n\nresults. Technological advancements have led to a polymerase\n\nchain reaction (PCR), which takes small samples of DNA and\n\nreproduces as many copies as are needed for adequate analysis.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">Short tandem repeats (STRs), which are even smaller pieces of the\n\nDNA helix (ladder), can be reproduced using PCR to generate\n\nmultiple copies in an instrument called a thermocycle. With the\n\nPCR-STR process, it takes about 24 hours to extract DNA from\n\nan evidentiary sample and only 2 to 3 hours to type the DNA\n\nusing automation. It works well on degraded samples and on\n\nanalysis of old cases.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                    13</span>\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">Contamination\n\n      Just as contamination is an issue in the collection and\n\npackaging of evidence containing DNA, it is a very big issue in\n\nthe handling of DNA during extraction and examination. It is also\n\nan issue that can affect the admissibility of, and credibility given\n\nto, DNA evidence in court. Coughing or sneezing while handing\n\nDNA evidence can cause contamination.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">(Sources: (i) Genetics a Graphic Guide by Steve Jones and Borin Van Loon\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">(ii) All about us, by Joe Kaufman\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">(iii) Evolution, by Dorling Kindersley\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">(iv) Criminal Investigation by Swanson Chamelin and Territo Taylor)\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\">      5.

They lived together for some time. She left for her\n\nmaternal home to prepare for her Higher Secondary Examination,\n\nwhich was during April - May 1990.               She is said to have\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                14</span>\n\n\n\nconceived in April 1990. The appellant and his family did not\n\nwant her to beget a child. She was being forced to undergo an\n\nabortion.    She had resisted and ultimately went away to her\n\nmaternal home in October 1990. A female child was born to her\n\nin January 1991. Since her husband had neglected her and her\n\nchild, she is said to have filed a petition for maintenance, for\n\nherself and her child. An exparte order was said to have been\n\npassed by the Magistrate awarding a sum of Rs.300/- for her and\n\nRs.200/- for the child.   The appellant is said to have field a\n\nRevision Petition before the High Court.</span> The appellant had also\n\nmoved a Criminal Miscellaneous case seeking a blood group test\n\nof the second respondent and the child.      The appellant had\n\ndisputed the paternity of the child. That application was said to\n\nhave been dismissed holding that there are other methods to\n\ndisprove paternity and that a medical test is not conclusive of\n\npaternity.    A Revision Petition against the said order was\n\ndismissed by the High Court holding that in view of <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 112</a>\n\nof the Evidence Act, 1872, where during the continuance of a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                                       15</span>\n\n\n\nvalid marriage if a child is born that is a conclusive proof about\n\nthe legitimacy.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\">      In the appeal, the Apex Court examined the law as available\n\nin other jurisdictions thus:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">            &quot;         8. Before we deal with the arguments, we\n            will examine the law as available in England. At the\n            beginning of the century scientists established that\n            human blood had certain characteristics which could\n            be genetically transmitted. The first recognised system\n            was ABO blood group. The blood group of a child is\n            determined by the parents&#x27; genetic make-up but the\n            number of possibilities is such, that it is not possible to\n            prove that certain individuals are the father on the\n            basis of comparing blood groups, only, that they are\n            not the father.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">                9. By 1930s other immunological test became\n            available. As a result the possibility of establishing\n            paternity increased. An attempt by way of statutory\n            provision to make blood test compulsory in England\n            failed in 1938. However, in 1957 the Affiliation\n            Proceedings Act was passed. Under that Act, it was\n            assumed that a man was the father once a sexual\n            relationship with the mother at the time of conception\n            was proven unless he could show another man had\n            intercourse with her at that time.

The Family Reforms Act, 1969 conferred\npowers on the court to direct taking blood test in civil\nproceedings in paternity cases. Courts were able to\ngive directions for the use of the blood test and taking\nblood samples from the child, the mother and any\nperson alleged to be the father. Since the passing of\n1969 Act the general practice has been to use blood\ntests when paternity is in issue. However, it is to be\nstated the court cannot order a person to submit to\ntests but can draw adverse inferences from a refusal to\ndo so. Now under the Family Reforms Act, 1987 in\nkeeping with modern thinking on the continuing and\nshared responsibility of parenthood, &#x27;parentage&#x27; rather\nthan paternity has to be determined before the court.\nFathers as well as mothers can apply for maintenance.\nTherefore contests can include mothers denial of\npaternity. <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_12\">This Act</a> finally removed the legal aid for\ncorroboration of mother&#x27;s statement of paternity.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">   12.

The magistrate can only do it by consent of\n those concerned, namely, the grown-ups and the\n mother on behalf of the child; but, nevertheless, if\n any of them does not consent, the magistrate can\n take that refusal into account. 1 adhere to the view\n which I expressed in Re. L. that (6):\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">          &quot;If an adult unreasonably refuses to\n      have a blood test, or to allow a child to have\n      one, I think that it is open to the court in any\n      civil proceedings (no matter whether it be a\n      paternity issue or an affiliation summons, or\n      a custody proceedings) to take his refusal as\n      evidence against him, and may draw an\n      inference there from adverse to him. This is\n      simple common sense.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\">   The conclusion of the whole matter is that a judge\nof the High Court has power to order a blood test\nwhenever it is in the best interests of the child.

As regards United States the law as stated in\nForensic Sciences edited by Cyril H. Wecht is as\nunder:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">      &quot; Parentage testing is the major (but not\n   the exclusive) involvement of forensic serology\n   in civil cases. The majority of disputed\n   parentage cases involve disputed paternity,\n   although an occasional disputed maternity, or\n   baby mix-up case does arise, and can be\n   solved using the tools of forensic serology\n   described in this chapter. Blood typing has\n   been used to help resolve paternity cases since\n   the mid- 1920&#x27;s. According to Latters, there\n   were 3,000 cases tested in Berlin in 1924, and\n   Schiff and Boyd said that the first case went to\n   court in Berlin in 1924. Ottenberg, in this\n   country published paternity exclusion tables in\n   192 1, as did Dyke in England in 1922. It took\n   somewhat longer to satisfy the courts, both in\n   Europe and in country, that parentage\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                      19</span>\n\n\n\nexclusions based upon blood grouping were\ncompletely valid. Wiener said that he had\nobtained an exclusion in a paternity case in\nthis country which reached the courts early in\n1933. In January of 1934, Justice Steinbrink\nof the New York Supreme Court in Brooklyn\nordered that blood tests be performed in a\ndisputed paternity action, using as precedent a\ndecision by the Italian Supreme Court of\nCassation, but his order was reversed upon\nappeal. Soon afterward, however, laws were\npassed in a number of states providing the\ncourts with statutory authority to order blood\ntesting in disputed paternity cases.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">    Paternity testing has developed somewhat\nmore slowly in the United States than in\ncertain of the European countries, but today\nthe differences in the number of systems\nemployed, and judicial acceptance of the\nresults, are no longer than great. A number of\nauthorities have recently reviewed the subject\nof paternity testing in some detail, and in some\ncases have summarized the results of large\nnumber of cases that they have investigated.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">     Walker points out that failure to exclude a\nman, even at the 95 percent level of paternity\nexclusion does not mean that the alleged\nfather is proven to be biologic father, because\nabsolute proof of paternity cannot be\nestablished by any known blood test available.\nAlthough this fact is well known and\nappreciated by workers in the field of blood\ngrouping and by attorneys active in this area,\nit is not generally understood by the lay\npublic. However, blood group serology, using\nproven genetic marker systems, represents the\nmost      accurate    scientific    information\nconcerning paternity and is so recognised in\nthe United States, as well as in a number of\ncountries abroad.&quot;\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                          20</span>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_17\">     15.

The law is very strict\nregarding the type of the evidence which can be let in\nto rebut the presumption of legitimacy of a child. Even\nproof that the mother committed adultery with any\nnumber of men will not of itself suffice for proving the\nillegitimacy of the child. If she had access to her\nhusband during the time the child could have been\nbegotten the law will not countenance any attempt on\nthe part of the husband to prove that the child is not\nactually his. The presumption of law of legitimacy of a\nchild will not be lightly repelled. It will not be allowed\nto be broken or shaken by a mere balance of\nprobability. The evidence of non-access for the\npurpose of repelling it must be strong, distinct,\nsatisfactory and conclusive (See Morris v. Davies,\n(1837)5 Cl. &amp; Fin.163). The standard of proof in this\nregard is similar to the standard of proof of guilt in a\ncriminal case. These rigours are justified by\nconsiderations of public policy for there are a variety\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">                           22</span>\n\n\n\nof reasons why a child&#x27;s status is not to be triffled with.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_22\">The stigma of illegitimacy is very severe and we have\nnot any of the protective legislations as in England to\nprotect illegitimate children. No doubt, this may in\nsome cases require a husband to maintain children of\nwhom he is probably not their father. But, the\nlegislature alone can change the rigour of the law and\nnot the court. The court cannot base a conclusion on\nevidence different from that required by the law or\ndecide on a balance of probability which will be the\nresult if blood test evidence is accepted.\n   There is an aspect of the matter also. Before a\nblood test of a person is ordered his consent is\nrequired. The reason is that this test is a constraint on\nhis personal liberty and cannot be carried out without\nhis consent. Whether even a legislature can compel a\nblood test is doubtful. Here no consent is given by any\nof the respondents. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"40401\" id=\"span_23\">It is also doubtful whether a\nguardian ad litem can give this consent. Therefore, in\nthese circumstances, the learned Munsiff was right in\nrefusing the prayer for a blood test of the appellant\nand respondents 2 and 3. The learned Judge is also\ncorrect in holding that there was no illegality in\nrefusing a blood test. The maximum that can be done\nwhere a party refuses to have a blood test is to draw\nan adverse inference (See in this connection <a href=\"/doc/40401/\" id=\"a_20\">Subayya\nGounder v. Bhoopala</a>, AIR 1959 Madras 396), and the\nearlier decision of the same court in Venkateswarlu v.\nSubbayya AIR 1951 Madras 910(1). Such an adverse\ninference which has only a very little relevance here\nwill not advance the appellants case to any extent. He\nhas to prove that he had no opportunity to have any\nsexual intercourse with the 1st respondent at a time\nwhen these children could have been begotten.

Blood tests cannot\n     show positively that any man is father, but\n     they can show positively that a given man\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">                     24</span>\n\n\n\ncould or could not be the father. It is\nobviously the latter aspect that proves most\nvaluable in determining paternity, that is, the\nexclusion aspect for once it is determined that\na man could not be the father, he is thereby\nautomatically excluded from considerations of\npaternity. When a man is not the father of a\nchild, it has been said that there is at least a\n70 per cent chance that if blood tests are taken\nthey will show. positively he is not the father,\nand in some cases the chance is even higher:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">between two given men who have had sexual\nintercourse with the mother at the time of\nconception, both of whom undergo blood tests,\nit has likewise been said that there is a 80 per\ncent chance that the tests will show that one of\nthem is not the father with the irresistible\ninference that the other is the father.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">    The position which emerges on reference\nto these authoritative texts is that depending\non the type of litigation, samples of blood,\nwhen subjected to skilled scientific\nexamination, can sometimes supply helpful\nevidence on various issues, to exclude a\nparticular parentage set up in the case. But\nthe consideration remains that the party\nasserting the claim to have a child and the\nrival set of parents put to blood test must\nestablish his right so to do. The court\nexercises protective jurisdiction on behalf of\nan infant. In my considered opinion it would\nbe unjust and not fair either to direct a test for\na collateral reason to assist a litigant in his or\nher claim. The child cannot be allowed to\nsuffer because of his incapacity; the aim is to\nensure that he gets his rights. If in a case the\ncourt has reason to believe that the\napplication for blood test is of a fishing nature\nor designed for some ulterior motive, it would\nbe justified in not acceding to such a prayer.&quot;\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">                         25</span>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_27\">  21.The above is the dicta laid down by the various\nHigh Courts. In matters of this kind the court must\nhave regard to <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_24\">section 112</a> of the Evidence Act. This\nsection is based on the well known maxim pater est\nquem nuptioe demonstrant (he is the father whom the\nmarriage indicates). The presumption of legitimacy is\nthis, that a child born of a married woman is deemed\nto be legitimate, it throws on the person who is\ninterested in making out the illegitimacy, the whole\nburden of proving it. The law presumes both that a\nmarriage ceremony is valid, and that every person is\nlegitimate. Marriage or affiliation (parentage) may be\npresumed, the law in general presuming against vice\nand immorality.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_28\">  22. It is a rebuttable presumption of law that a\nchild born during the lawful wedlock is legitimate, and\nthat access occurred between the parents. This\npresumption can only be displaced by a strong\npreponderance of evidence, and not by a mere balance\nof probabilities.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_29\">  23. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"503124\" id=\"span_29\">In <a href=\"/doc/503124/\" id=\"a_25\">Smt.

This rule of law based on\n    the dictates of justice has always made the\n    courts incline towards upholding the\n    legitimacy of a child unless the facts are so\n    compulsive and clinching as to necessarily\n    warrant a finding that the child could not at all\n    have been begotten to the father and as such a\n    legitimation of the child would result in rank\n    injustice to the father. Courts have always\n    desisted from lightly or hastily rendering a\n    verdict and that too, on the basis of slender\n    materials, which will have the effect of\n    branding a child as a bastard and its mother\n    an unchaste woman.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_30\"> 24.

In other\nwords, the party who wants to dislodge the conclusiveness\nhas the burden to show a negative, not merely that he did\nnot have the opportunity to approach his wife but that she\ntoo did not have the opportunity of approaching him during\nthe relevant time.

We may remember that <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 112</a> of the\nEvidence Act was enacted at a time when the modern\nscientific advancements with Dioxy Nucleic Acid (DNA) as\nwell as Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) tests were not even in\ncontemplation of the legislature. The result of a genuine\nDNA test is said to be scientifically accurate. But even that\nis not enough to escape from the conclusiveness of <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_38\">Section\n112</a> of the Act, e.g. if a husband and wife were living\ntogether during the time of conception but the DNA test\nrevealed that the child was not born to the husband, the\nconclusiveness in law would remain unrebuttable. This may\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">                                 32</span>\n\n\n\nlook hard from the point of view of the husband who would\nbe compelled to bear the fatherhood of a child of which he\nmay be innocent. But even in such a case the law leans in\nfavour of the innocent child from being bastardized if his\nmother and her spouse were living together during the time\nof conception. Hence the question regarding the degree of\nproof of non-access for rebutting the conclusiveness must\nbe answered in the light of what is meant by access or non-\naccess as delineated above.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_44\">       11. Whether the burden on the husband is as hard\nas the prosecution to prove the guilt of the accused in a\ntrial deserves consideration in the above background. The\nstandard of proof of prosecution to prove the guilt beyond\nany reasonable doubt belongs to criminal jurisprudence\nwhereas the test of preponderance of probabilities belongs\nto civil cases. The reason for insisting on proof beyond\nreasonable doubt in criminal cases is to guard against\ninnocent being convicted and sent to jail if not to extreme\npenalty of death. It would be too hard if that standard is\nimported in a civil case for a husband to prove non-access\nas the very concept of non-access is negative in nature. But\nat the same time the test of preponderance of probability is\ntoo light as that might expose many children to the peril of\nbeing illegitimatised. If a court declares that the husband is\nnot the father of his wife&#x27;s child, without tracing out its real\nfather the fall out on the child is ruinous apart from all the\nignominy visiting his mother. The bastardized child, when\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">                                 33</span>\n\n\n\ngrows up would be socially ostracised and can easily fall\ninto wayward life. Hence, by way of abundant caution and\nas a matter of public policy, law cannot afford to allow\nsuch consequence befalling an innocent child on the\nstrength of a mere tilting of probability. Its corollary is that\nthe burden of the plaintiff-husband should be higher than\nthe standard of preponderance of probabilities. The\nstandard of proof in such cases must at least be of a degree\nin between the two as to ensure that there was no\npossibility of the child being conceived through the\nplaintiff-husband.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_45\">        12. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"503124\" id=\"span_40\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1259126\" id=\"span_41\">In <a href=\"/doc/1259126/\" id=\"a_39\">Goutam Kundu vs. State of West Bengal</a>\n{1993(3) SCC 418} this Court after considering an early\nthree-Judge Bench decision in <a href=\"/doc/503124/\" id=\"a_40\">Smt.

The order having been challenged before the High Court,\n\nThe High Court held that it was not a case where a DNA test\n\nshould have been ordered. And it was not for the court to create\n\nevidence by directing a DNA test.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_49\">      In appeal, the Apex Court while placing reliance on the\n\nviews expressed in Goutam Kundu, Dukhtar Jahan and Amarjit\n\nKaur and Kamti Devi held thus:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_50\">              &quot;14. The main object of a Succession Certificate is\n      to facilitate collection of debts on succession and afford\n      protection to parties paying debts to representatives of\n      deceased persons. All that the Succession Certificate\n      purports to do is to facilitate the collection of debts, to\n      regulate the administration of succession and to protect\n      persons who deal with the alleged representatives of the\n      deceased persons. Such a certificate does not give any\n      general power of administration on the estate of the\n      deceased. The grant of a certificate does not establish title\n      of the grantee as the heir of the deceased. A Succession\n      Certificate is intended as noted above to protect the\n      debtors, which means that where a debtor of a deceased\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">                                 36</span>\n\n\n\nperson either voluntarily pays his debt to a person holding\na Certificate under the Act, or is compelled by the decree of\na Court to pay it to the person, he is lawfully discharged.\nThe grant of a certificate does not establish a title of the\ngrantee as the heir of the deceased, but only furnishes him\nwith authority to collect his debts and allows the debtors to\nmake payments to him without incurring any risk. In order\nto succeed in the succession application the applicant has\nto adduce cogent and credible evidence in support of the\napplication. The respondents, if they so chooses, can also\nadduce evidence to oppose grant of succession certificate.\nThe trial court erroneously held that the documents\nproduced by the respondents were not sufficient or relevant\nfor the purpose of adjudication and DNA test was\nconclusive. This is not a correct view. It is for the parties to\nplace evidence in support of their respective claims and\nestablish their stands. DNA test is not to be directed as a\nmatter of routine and only in deserving cases such a\ndirection can be given, as was noted in Goutam Kundu&#x27;s\ncase (supra). Present case does not fall to that category.\nHigh Court&#x27;s judgment does not suffer from any infirmity.\nWe, therefore, uphold it. It is made clear that we have not\nexpressed any opinion on the merits of the case relating to\nsuccession application.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_51\">        15. Above being the position, the direction for DNA\ntest as was given by the trial court is clearly unsustainable\nand the High Court has rightly set it aside.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">                                    37</span>\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_52\">             16.

When a man is not the father of a child, it has\nbeen said that there is at least a 70 per cent chance that if\nblood tests are taken they will show positively he is not the\nfather, and in some cases the chance is even higher;\nbetween two given men who have had sexual intercourse\nwith the mother at the time of conception, both of whom\nundergo blood tests, it has likewise been said that there is a\n90 per cent chance that the tests will show that one of them\nis not the father with the irresistible inference that the other\nis the father.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_53\">       16.

We may remember that <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_58\">Section 112</a> of the\nEvidence Act was enacted at a time when the modern\nscientific advancements with deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)\nas well as ribonucleic acid (RNA) tests were not even in\ncontemplation of the legislature.

In a matter where paternity of a child is in issue\nbefore the court, the use of DNA test is an extremely delicate\nand sensitive aspect. One view is that when modern science\ngives means of ascertaining the paternity of a child, there\nshould not be any hesitation to use those means whenever\nthe occasion requires. The other view is that the court must\nbe reluctant in the use of such scientific advances and tools\nwhich result in invasion of right to privacy of an individual\nand may not only be prejudicial to the rights of the parties\nbut may have devastating effect on the child. Sometimes the\nresult of such scientific test may bastardise an innocent\nchild even though his mother and her spouse were living\ntogether during the time of conception.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_63\">       22. In our view, when there is apparent conflict\nbetween the right to privacy of a person not to submit\nhimself forcibly to medical examination and duty of the\ncourt to reach the truth, the court must exercise its\ndiscretion only after balancing the interests of the parties\nand on due consideration whether for a just decision in the\nmatter, DNA test is eminently needed. DNA test in a matter\nrelating to paternity of a child should not be directed by the\ncourt as a matter of course or in a routine manner,\nwhenever such a request is made. The court has to consider\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_60\">                                 43</span>\n\n\n\ndiverse aspects including presumption under <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_61\">Section 112</a> of\nthe Evidence Act; pros and cons of such order and the test\nof `eminent need&#x27; whether it is not possible for the court to\nreach the truth without use of such test.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_64\">          23. There is no conflict in the two decisions of this\nCourt, namely, Goutam Kundu and Sharda. In Goutam\nKundu, it has been laid down that courts in India cannot\norder blood test as a matter of course and such prayers\ncannot be granted to have roving inquiry; there must be\nstrong prima facie case and court must carefully examine as\nto what would be the consequence of ordering the blood test.\nIn the case of Sharda while concluding that a matrimonial\ncourt has power to order a person to undergo a medical\ntest, it was reiterated that the court should exercise such a\npower if the applicant has a strong prima facie case and\nthere is sufficient material before the court. Obviously,\ntherefore, any order for DNA test can be given by the court\nonly if a strong prima facie case is made out for such a\ncourse.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_65\">          24. Insofar as the present case is concerned, we\nhave already held that the State Commission has no\nauthority, competence or power to order DNA test. Looking\nto the nature of proceedings with which the High Court was\nconcerned, it has to be held that High Court exceeded its\njurisdiction in passing the impugned order. Strangely, the\nHigh Court over-looked a very material aspect that the\nmatrimonial dispute between the parties is already pending\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_61\">                                     44</span>\n\n\n\n      in the court of competent jurisdiction and all aspects\n      concerning matrimonial dispute raised by the parties <a href=\"/doc/705395/\" id=\"a_62\">in that\n      case</a> shall be adjudicated and determined by that Court.\n      Should an issue arise before the matrimonial court\n      concerning the paternity of the child, obviously that court\n      will be competent to pass an appropriate order at the\n      relevant time in accordance with law.

Before we proceed to consider the rival\n      submissions, we deem it necessary to understand what\n      exactly DNA test is and ultimately its accuracy. All living\n      beings are composed of cells which are the smallest and\n      basic unit of life. An average human body has trillion of\n      cells of different sizes. DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid), which\n      is found in the chromosomes of the cells of living beings, is\n      the blueprint of an individual. Human cells contain 46\n      chromosomes and those 46 chromosomes contain a total of\n      six billion base pair in 46 duplex threads of DNA. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1039362\" id=\"span_64\">DNA\n      consists of four nitrogenous bases -       adenine, thymine,\n      cytosine, guanine and phosphoric acid arranged in a\n      regular structure. When two unrelated people possessing the\n      same DNA pattern have been compared, the chances of\n      complete similarity are 1 in 30 billion to 300 billion. Given\n      that the Earth&#x27;s population is about 5 billion, this test shall\n      have accurate result. It has been recognized by this Court in\n      the case of <a href=\"/doc/1039362/\" id=\"a_64\">Kamti Devi, (2001) 5 SCC</a> 311 (supra) that the\n      result of a genuine DNA test is scientifically accurate. It is\n      nobody&#x27;s case that the result of the DNA test is not genuine\n      and, therefore, we have to proceed on an assumption that\n      the result of the DNA test is accurate. The DNA test reports\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_65\">                                46</span>\n\n\n\nshow that the appellant is not the biological father of the\ngirl child.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_66\">        14. Now we have to consider as to whether the DNA\ntest would be sufficient to hold that the appellant is not the\nbiological father of respondent no. 2, in the face of what has\nbeen provided under <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_65\">Section 112</a> of the Evidence Act, which\nreads as follows:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_67\">               &quot;112. Birth during marriage,\n        conclusive proof of legitimacy.- The fact that\n        any person was born during the continuance\n        of a valid marriage between his mother and\n        any man, or within two hundred and eighty\n        days after its dissolution, the mother\n        remaining unmarried, shall be conclusive\n        proof that he is the legitimate son of that\n        man, unless it can be shown that the parties\n        to the marriage had no access to each other\n        at any time when he could have been\n        begotten&quot;.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_69\">From a plain reading of the aforesaid, it is evident that a\nchild born during the continuance of a valid marriage shall\nbe a conclusive proof that the child is a legitimate child of\nthe man to whom the lady giving birth is married. The\nprovision makes the legitimacy of the child to be a\nconclusive proof, if the conditions aforesaid are satisfied. It\ncan be denied only if it is shown that the parties to the\nmarriage have no access to each other at any time when the\nchild could have been begotten.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_70\">        15. Here, in the present case, the wife had pleaded\nthat the husband had access to her and, in fact, the child\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_66\">                               47</span>\n\n\n\nwas born in the said wedlock, but the husband had\nspecifically pleaded that after his wife left the matrimonial\nhome, she did not return and thereafter, he had no access to\nher. The wife has admitted that she had left the matrimonial\nhome but again joined her husband. Unfortunately, none of\nthe courts below have given any finding with regard to this\nplea of the husband that he had or had not any access to his\nwife at the time when the child could have been begotten.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_71\">       16. As stated earlier, the DNA test is an accurate test\nand on that basis it is clear that the appellant is not the\nbiological father of the girl- child. However, at the same\ntime, the condition precedent for invocation of <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_66\">Section 112</a>\nof the Evidence Act has been established and no finding with\nregard to the plea of the husband that he had no access to\nhis wife at the time when the child could have been begotten\nhas been recorded. Admittedly, the child has been born\nduring the continuance of a valid marriage. Therefore, the\nprovisions of <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_67\">Section 112</a> of the Evidence Act conclusively\nprove that respondent No. 2 is the daughter of the appellant.\nAt the same time, the DNA test reports, based on scientific\nanalysis, in no uncertain terms suggest that the appellant is\nnot the biological father. In such circumstance, which would\ngive way to the other is a complex question posed before us.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_72\">       17. We may remember that <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_68\">Section 112</a> of the\nEvidence Act was enacted at a time when the modern\nscientific advancement and DNA test were not even in\ncontemplation of the Legislature. The result of DNA test is\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_67\">                                48</span>\n\n\n\nsaid to be scientifically accurate. Although <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_69\">Section 112</a>\nraises a presumption of conclusive proof on satisfaction of\nthe conditions enumerated therein but the same is\nrebuttable. The presumption may afford legitimate means of\narriving at an affirmative legal conclusion. While the truth\nor fact is known, in our opinion, there is no need or room\nfor any presumption. Where there is evidence to the\ncontrary, the presumption is rebuttable and must yield to\nproof. Interest of justice is best served by ascertaining the\ntruth and the court should be furnished with the best\navailable science and may not be left to bank upon\npresumptions, unless science has no answer to the facts in\nissue. In our opinion, when there is a conflict between a\nconclusive proof envisaged under law and a proof based on\nscientific advancement accepted by the world community to\nbe correct, the latter must prevail over the former.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_73\">       18. We must understand the distinction between a\nlegal fiction and the presumption of a fact. Legal fiction\nassumes existence of a fact which may not really exist.\nHowever presumption of a fact depends on satisfaction of\ncertain circumstances. Those circumstances logically would\nlead to the fact sought to be presumed. <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_70\">Section 112</a> of the\nEvidence Act does not create a legal fiction but provides for\npresumption.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_74\">       19. The husband&#x27;s plea that he had no access to the\nwife when the child was begotten stands proved by the DNA\ntest report and in the face of it, we cannot compel the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_68\">                               49</span>\n\n\n\nappellant to bear the fatherhood of a child, when the\nscientific reports prove to the contrary. We are conscious\nthat an innocent child may not be bastardized as the\nmarriage between her mother and father was subsisting at\nthe time of her birth, but in view of the DNA test reports and\nwhat we have observed above, we cannot forestall the\nconsequence. It is denying the truth. &quot;Truth must triumph&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_68\">is the hallmark of justice.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_75\">       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1039362\" id=\"span_69\">20. As regards the authority of this Court in the case\nof <a href=\"/doc/1039362/\" id=\"a_71\">Kamti Devi</a> (Supra), this Court on appreciation of\nevidence came to the conclusion that the husband had no\nopportunity whatsoever to have liaison with the wife. There\nwas no DNA test held in the case. In the said background\ni.e. non- access of the husband with the wife, this Court held\nthat the result of DNA test &quot;is not enough to escape from the\nconclusiveness of <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_72\">Section 112</a> of the Act.&quot; The judgment has\nto be understood in the factual scenario of the said case.\nThe said judgment has not held that DNA test is to be\nignored. In fact, this Court has taken note of the fact that\nDNA test is scientifically accurate. We hasten to add that in\nnone of the cases <a href=\"/doc/1039362/\" id=\"a_73\">referred to above</a>, this Court was\nconfronted with a situation in which DNA test report, in\nfact, was available and was in conflict with the presumption\nof conclusive proof of legitimacy of the child under <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_74\">Section\n112</a> of the Evidence Act. In view of what we have observed\nabove, these judgments in no way advance the case of the\nrespondents.</span>\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_70\">                                    50</span>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_76\">             21. In the result, we allow this appeal, set aside the\n      impugned judgment so far as it directs payment of\n      maintenance to respondent no.2. However, we direct that\n      the payments already made shall not be recovered from the\n      respondents.&quot;\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_77\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"39335671\" id=\"span_71\"><a href=\"/doc/39335671/\" id=\"a_75\">Dharam Deo Yadav Vs. State of Uttar Predesh</a>, (2014)5 SCC 509\n\n\n      While addressing the acceptability of the DNA Report in a\n\ncriminal case, the Apex Court was observed thus:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_69\">             &quot;36. The DNA stands for deoxyribonucleic acid,\n          which is the biological blueprint of every life. DNA is\n          made up of a double stranded structure consisting of\n          a deoxyribose sugar and phosphate backbone, cross-\n          linked with two types of nucleic acids referred to as\n          adenine and guanine, purines and         thymine and\n          cytosine pyrimidines.    The most important role of\n          DNA profile is in the identification, such as an\n          individual and his blood relations such as mother,\n          father, brother, and so on. Successful identification\n          of skeleton remains can also be performed by DNA\n          profiling. DNA usually can be obtained from any\n          biological material such as blood, semen, saliva, hair\n          skin, bones, etc. The question as to whether DNA\n          tests are virtually infallible may be a moot question,\n          but the fact remains that such test has come to stay\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_72\">                                    51</span>\n\n\n\n          and is being used extensively in the investigation of\n          crimes and the court often accepts the views of the\n          experts, especially when cases rest on circumstantial\n          evidence.   More than half a century, samples of\n          human DNA began to be used in the criminal justice\n          system. Of course, debate lingers over the safeguards\n          that should be required in testing samples and in\n          presenting the evidence in court.       DNA profile,\n          however, is consistently held to be valid and reliable,\n          but of course, it depends on the quality control and\n          quality assurance procedures in the laboratory.\n          Close relatives have more genes in common than\n          individuals and various procedures have been\n          proposed for dealing with a possibility that true\n          source of forensic DNA is of close relative. So far as\n          this case is concerned. ...&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_78\">      6.
