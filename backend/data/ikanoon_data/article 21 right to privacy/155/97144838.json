The present case highlights the exponential growth of Online Fantasy\nSports [hereinafter &quot;OFS&quot;] in India. As per a report prepared by Deloitte\nTouche Tohmatsu India LLP and the Federation of Indian Fantasy Sports in\nthe year 2022, the OFS market in India has (i) over thirteen crore users in\nthe country already; (ii) provided over 5,000 indirect jobs with the potential\nto create more employment opportunities in the future; and, (iii) created\nopportunities for investment and commerce through sponsorships,\npartnerships and the like1. In 2020, the Niti Aayog, in its discussion paper\nfocused toward identifying the OFS space in India, highlighted the\nexponential growth in the Indian OFS market and made recommendations\non how to navigate the unchartered waters of online fantasy sports gaming2.\nAs recent as 6th April, 2023, after judgment was reserved in the present\ncase, even the Central Government has notified the Information Technology\n(Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Amendment\nRules, 2023, aiming to regulate online gaming through a self-regulatory\nmodel and at the same time, provide an enabling framework to allow the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">1</span>\n  FIFS &amp; DELOITTE, FANTASY SPORTS: CREATING A VIRTUOUS CYCLE OF SPORTS DEVELOPMENT 8, 20-\n37 (2022).\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">2</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">  NITI AAYOG, GUIDING PRINCIPLES FOR THE UNIFORM NATIONAL-LEVEL REGULATION OF ONLINE\nFANTASY SPORTS PLATFORMS IN INDIA DRAFT FOR DISCUSSION 1-4 (2020).\n</p>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                                                  Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                                                  Digitally Signed By:AMIT</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                                                  BANSAL</span>\n\n<pre id=\"pre_2\">CS(COMM) 108/2023                                                      Page\n                                                                  Signing      2 of 51 13:09:16\n                                                                          Date:26.04.2023\n                                      2023:DHC:2796\n\n\n\n\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_5\">OFS sector to expand3. Before proceeding any further, it may be useful to\nunderstand what the basic concept of an OFS game is and how it functions.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">2.      OFS games are a form of online gaming offered on the internet that\nallow users/fans of sports to create and manage their own virtual teams\nbased on real athletes in formats set by online gaming platforms. Such\nonline games allow users to compete against each other in various virtual\ngaming events/leagues centred around real-world sporting events and are\nbased on, inter alia, the statistical data of the performance of sportspersons.\nTo participate in the fantasy sports games offered by these online platforms,\nusers are generally required to pay an entry fee. Once a user pays the\nrequisite entry fee, they can use their skill and knowledge to enter the online\nevents/leagues and earn points on their players, change the composition of\ntheir teams by adding and/or removing players, and ultimately win awards\nand prizes.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">3.      There is no one standard formant of OFS and various operators are\nbringing out their own variations so as to differentiate their OFS games from\nthe others. Although the legality of OFS gaming formats is not subject\nmatter of the present dispute, the issues involving its legality have been dealt\nwith by Indian courts. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"110709617\" id=\"span_6\">In <a href=\"/doc/110709617/\" id=\"a_1\">Varun Gumber v.

The business model of the plaintiff no.1 requires that its Digital Player\n      Cards be technologically capable of being identified and distinguished\n      as authentic and original in the online marketplace. Towards this, the\n      plaintiff no.1 uses its unique software code, which is embedded in the\n      officially licensed Digital Player Cards, by virtue of which the cards\n      function as &quot;Non-Fungible Tokens&quot; [hereinafter &quot;NFTs&quot;].\n18.4.

It\n      is not linked to the real-world performances of the player in the\n      cricket match, although better real-world performance increases a\n      player&#x27;s popularity and causes demand for their Digital Playing Cards.\n18.6. Plaintiff no.1 has invested a huge amount of money, to the tune of\n      Rs.1,48,32,35,589/- in the last year alone, to procure such exclusive\n      licenses and authorizations from the plaintiffs no. 2 to 6.

The use of names and images of sportspersons is a prevalent and\n      prominent feature of all OFS games in India and abroad. Fantasy\n      sports leagues are based entirely on the existence and real life\n      performances of actual players and on-field events. By their very\n      nature, fantasy games can only be played if all the relevant players are\n      listed and available to choose from and capable of being identified on\n      the platform.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">20.8.

The defendant no.2&#x27;s product, Striker only offers an OFS game,\n      whereas the product of the plaintiffs, Rario, in addition, offers users\n      the option to &quot;buy&quot; and &quot;own&quot; cricket moments.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">21.2. The material used by the defendant no.2 for its fantasy game Striker is\n      in the nature of facts and information available in public domain and\n      is therefore, beyond the scope of personality rights of the players.\n      Therefore, the plaintiffs have wrongly placed reliance on the\n      exclusive license agreements with plaintiffs no.2 to 6.\n</blockquote>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">                                                          Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">                                                          Digitally Signed By:AMIT</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">                                                          BANSAL</span>\n\n<pre id=\"pre_6\">CS(COMM) 108/2023                                              Page\n                                                          Signing      10 of 51 13:09:16\n                                                                  Date:26.04.2023\n                               2023:DHC:2796\n\n\n\n\n</pre><blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">21.3. The case set up by the plaintiffs is on a misconception that an entity\n      requires consent/authorisation of an individual sportsperson in order\n      to use facts, information, images and other materials necessary to\n      identify those players to enable the playing of games on OFS\n      platforms.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">21.4. Fantasy games such as Striker necessarily have to include all players\n      so as to form a team by the user. The performance of a fantasy team\n      depends upon the on-field performance of the individual player during\n      a real cricket match.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">21.5. Since the fantasy games depend upon the inclusion of all players,\n      there is no scope of creating any impression that a particular player is\n      endorsing the fantasy game.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">21.6. The OFS of the defendant no.2 uses names, images and other\n      information of all potential players and therefore, it cannot be said\n      that a particular player is endorsing a fantasy game.\n21.7. The defendant no.2 is not in the business of buying, selling and\n      trading of NFT cards as stated in the plaint. The NFT cards are an\n      entry requirement to play the OFS game of defendant no.2.\n21.8. The Digital Player Cards cannot be traded or used outside the Striker\n      platform and are only meant to enhance the user experience in the\n      fantasy games.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">21.9. A large number of fantasy games are offered worldwide, including in\n      India, which use player identifiers, including, names, images and\n      basic statistics, as they are all available in the public domain.\n      Therefore, this is a well-settled industry practice in the business of\n      fantasy sports.\n</blockquote>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">                                                          Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">                                                          Digitally Signed By:AMIT</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">                                                          BANSAL</span>\n\n<pre id=\"pre_7\">CS(COMM) 108/2023                                              Page\n                                                          Signing      11 of 51 13:09:16\n                                                                  Date:26.04.2023\n                               2023:DHC:2796\n\n\n\n\n</pre><blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">21.10.There is no statutory provision in India which envisages protection of\n      the rights claimed by the plaintiffs in the present suit.

Even otherwise, the defendant no.2 had\n      launched an extensive advertising and marketing campaign before\n      launching its platform Striker, starting from August, 2022.

The following submissions have been made on behalf of the plaintiffs:\n22.1. Indian law recognizes the right of personality/right of publicity. The\n      attempt of the defendants to characterize the right of personality under\n      Indian law as being limited to cases of unauthorized endorsement is\n      completely incorrect. The judgment in D.M. Entertainment Pvt. Ltd.\n      v. Baby Gift House and Ors., MANU/DE/2043/2010 recognizes\n      separate torts of &#x27;infringement of right to publicity&#x27; and &#x27;false\n      endorsement leading to passing off&#x27;. The tort of infringement of right\n      to publicity requires identifiability and includes a broad category of\n      acts    of    unauthorized     appropriation     of      an        individual&#x27;s\n      persona/attributes for commercial gain. Further, in Titan Industries\n      v. M/s.

The cause of action for filing the present suit is based on the sale and\n      trade in NFTs offered on Striker&#x27;s website and mobile applications\n      using players&#x27; names, images and other attributes.

Defendants incorrectly characterize the suit as one against the use of\n      information/materials available in the public domain.\n22.7. All sports players have limited playing time and therefore, they have a\n      right to monetize all aspects of their personality. Therefore,\n      defendants cannot use the personality of a sports player for their\n      monetary gains without any authorization from the celebrity.\n22.8. The value of NFTs on the Striker platform is derived from the\n      identity/personalities of the players and Striker is commercially\n      gaining from the sale/trade of such NFTs without authorization from\n      the players. This amounts to breach of personality rights.\n22.9. The commercial value and status of an NFT as an asset is the sense of\n      connection with the celebrity that the officially licensed NFT carries.\n      Even beyond the world of cricket, celebrity NFTs are extremely\n      valuable assets.

In common law jurisdictions such as the U.K. and Australia, the tort\n      of passing off is sufficient to deal with wrongs relating to\n      misappropriation of goodwill and reputation of a celebrity, including\n      use of names and likeness of celebrities. For a party to establish the\n      tort of passing off, there has to be misrepresentation by a defendant&#x27;s\n      use of a celebrity&#x27;s name/image in such a manner that consumers are\n      misled to believe that the celebrity is endorsing the defendant&#x27;s goods\n      or services or is otherwise affiliated or associated with the defendant&#x27;s\n      goods.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_65\">25.3.

The Court observed that &#x27;when a distinctive voice of a\n professional singer is widely known and is deliberately imitated in order to\n sell a product, the sellers had appropriated what is not theirs and have\n committed a tort in California&#x27;.

However, in arriving at this conclusion, the court took into\naccount the fact that the defendant, while incorporating certain player\ninformation in its video games such as height, weight and the like, did not\ninclude the athletes&#x27; names along with their likeness and statistical data. It is\nalso to be noted that this judgment dealt with the virtual video game and not\nan OFS game, which cannot function without the name, image and likeness\nof a player.

In\n this case also, the fantasy baseball products of the defendant incorporated\n the names and information of actual Major League Baseball players in an\n interactive form in connection with its fantasy baseball products. The court,\n while deciding in favour of C.B.C, observed that the information used in\n C.B.C&#x27;s fantasy baseball games is readily available in the public domain and\n in terms of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, this information\n was available to be used for everyone. The court also observed that such a\n user would not result in consumers being misled as the fantasy baseball\n games depends upon inclusion of all the players and there cannot be any\n impression being created that only a particular player is endorsing C.B.C&#x27;s\n products. It was further observed that all Major League Baseball players are\n rewarded handsomely by their participation in the games, as also through\n endorsements and sponsorship arrangements. The court went on to hold that\n C.B.C&#x27;s First Amendment right in offering its fantasy products supersedes\n the players&#x27; rights to publicity. These observations were made by the court\n despite the fact that there was a law in the State of Missouri that granted the\n right of publicity to individuals.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_36\"> 34.

This was yet another case before the Supreme Court of Indiana\ndealing with the right of an online fantasy sports operator to use the names,\npicture and statistics of sportspersons without their consent. Under the law\nof the State of Indiana, the right of publicity was a statutory right, albeit with\ncertain exemptions. Relying upon the earlier judgment of C.B.C. (supra) the\nCourt held that when informational and statistical data of a college athlete is\npresented on a fantasy sports website, it cannot be said that the athletes are\nendorsing a particular product in a manner of there being a violation of the\nright of publicity. The court observed that use of players&#x27; names, images and\nstatistics in conducting fantasy sports competitions bears a resemblance to\nthe publication of the same information in newspapers and news websites\nand therefore, would be covered within the statutory exception of\n&quot;newsworthiness&quot;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_38\">36.

This case involved the defendant selling t-shirts displaying the image\nof the plaintiff, Rihanna, a famous singer. Like in India, U.K. does not have\na specific law with regard to the right to publicity of a celebrity. The Court\nof Appeals observed that a celebrity seeking to control the use of their image\nmust rely upon some other cause of action such as breach of contract, breach\nof confidence, infringement of copyright or passing off. Applying the\nprinciples of passing off, it was held that the use of Rihanna&#x27;s image\nindicates that the t-shirts have been authorized and approved by Rihanna and\namounted to endorsement by Rihanna and hence, a case of passing off. What\nemerges from a reading of this judgment is that a celebrity does not have\nany right in English Law to prevent the use of their image unless an\nimpression is created that the celebrity has endorsed the goods or that the\nuse of the image has been authorized by the celebrity.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_88\">                                                          Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_89\">                                                          Digitally Signed By:AMIT</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_90\">                                                          BANSAL</span>\n\n<pre id=\"pre_13\">CS(COMM) 108/2023                                              Page\n                                                          Signing      28 of 51 13:09:16\n                                                                  Date:26.04.2023\n                                 2023:DHC:2796\n\n\n\n\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_46\">41.    From the discussion above, the legal position with regard to the right\nof publicity in the U.S. and the U.K. can be summarized as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_80\">  i.   In the U.S., there is no federal law in respect of the right of publicity.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_81\">       However, there are various State-specific laws that recognize this\n       right albeit with statutory exemptions/defences.\n ii.   The U.S. judgments discussed above clearly hold that the right of\n       publicity is subservient to the right of free speech guaranteed under\n       the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\niii.   The right under the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protects\n       all information about the celebrity/sportsperson available in the public\n       domain, such as name, image, performance information and the like.\n       Therefore, use of such information by OFS games would be protected\n       by the First Amendment.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_82\">iv.    The courts in the U.S. recognize the use of celebrity names,\n       caricatures, parodies and the like as being protected under the First\n       Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_83\"> v.    U.S. courts have held in favour of the plaintiff where the defendant is\n       using     the   image   or   voice   or   any   other     likeness              of    a\n       celebrity/sportsman in the context of an advertisement or an\n       endorsement to sell its products/services, as this amounts to trading in\n       an unfair manner on the reputation and goodwill of a celebrity and\n       meets the threshold of likelihood of confusion in the minds of the\n       public.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_91\">                                                            Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_92\">                                                            Digitally Signed By:AMIT</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_93\">                                                            BANSAL</span>\n\n<pre id=\"pre_14\">CS(COMM) 108/2023                                                Page\n                                                            Signing      29 of 51 13:09:16\n                                                                    Date:26.04.2023\n                                  2023:DHC:2796\n\n\n\n\n vi.    Where a significant creative component has been added to a\n</pre><blockquote id=\"blockquote_84\">        celebrity&#x27;s identity, it would amount to permissive use and would not\n        fall within the purview of violation of the right of publicity.\nvii.    U.S. courts view the right to publicity as a right to prevent others from\n        misappropriating the economic value generated by the celebrity&#x27;s\n        fame through merchandising of name, voice, signature, photograph or\n        likeness.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_85\">viii.   Unlike the U.S., the United Kingdom does not have any statute that\n        recognizes the right of personality or publicity of a celebrity. The\n        position in the U.K. is governed by common law. As noted in the\n        judgment of the Court of Appeal in Robyn (supra), there is no\n        inherent right of publicity in a celebrity and principles of passing off\n        are to be invoked in the context of the name or an image of a celebrity\n        being used to sell a product.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_86\">Extent of the Right of Publicity in India\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_47\">42.

In that\nview of the matter, injunction was declined. Since the case involved\npublicity rights of the organizer and not of an individual player, the\nobservations therein with regard to the publicity rights of a player would not\nconstitute the ratio decidendi of the judgment.

While granting a\ndecree of permanent injunction, the Court made the following observations:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_87\">       &quot;13. To avail the right against the infringement of right to\n       publicity, the plaintiff must be &#x27;identifiable&#x27; from defendant&#x27;s\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_98\">                                                          Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_99\">                                                          Digitally Signed By:AMIT</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_100\">                                                          BANSAL</span>\n\nCS(COMM) 108/2023                                              Page\n                                                          Signing      31 of 51 13:09:16\n                                                                  Date:26.04.2023\n                                2023:DHC:2796\n\n\n\n\n      unauthorized use. In this instant case, the evidence on record\n      very well establishes the primary requirement. As a secondary\n      consideration, it is necessary to show that the use must be\n      sufficient, adequate or substantial to identify that the\n      defendant is alleged to have appropriated the persona or some\n      of its essential attributes. The right of publicity protects\n      against the unauthorized appropriation of an individual&#x27;s\n      very persona which would result in unearned commercial\n      gain to another. In the present instance, the commercial use\n      of an individual&#x27;s identity is intended to increase the sales of\n      product by fusing the celebrity&#x27;s identity with the product and\n      thereby the defendants were selling those dolls, on the basis of\n      publicity value or goodwill in the artist&#x27;s persona into the\n      product i.e. doll. In Ali v. Playgirl Inc. 447 F Supp 723, it was\n      observed that;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_88\">          &#x27;The distinctive aspect of the common law right of\n          publicity is that it recognizes the commercial value of\n          the picture or representation of a prominent person or\n          performer, and protects his proprietary interest in the\n          profitability of his public reputation or persona.&#x27;\n\n      A similar view is echoed in Onassis V. Christian Dior- New\n      York Inc. 472 NYS 2D 261;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_89\">          &#x27;No one is free to trade on another&#x27;s name or\n          appearance and claim immunity because what he is\n          using is similar to but not identical with the original.&#x27;\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_90\">      14. The right of publicity can, in a jurisprudential sense, be\n      located with the individual&#x27;s right and autonomy to permit or\n      not permit the commercial exploitation of his likeness or some\n      attributes of his personality. However, a word of caution has\n      to be expressed here. In a free and democratic society, where\n      every individual&#x27;s right to free speech is assured, the over\n      emphasis on a famous person&#x27;s publicity rights can tend to\n      chill the exercise of such invaluable democratic right. Thus,\n      for instance, caricature, lampooning, parodies and the like,\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_101\">                                                           Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_102\">                                                           Digitally Signed By:AMIT</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_103\">                                                           BANSAL</span>\n\nCS(COMM) 108/2023                                               Page\n                                                           Signing      32 of 51 13:09:16\n                                                                   Date:26.04.2023\n                               2023:DHC:2796\n\n\n\n\n      which may tend to highlight some aspects of the individual&#x27;s\n      personality traits, may not constitute infringement of such\n      individual&#x27;s right to publicity. If it were held otherwise, an\n      entire genre of expression would be unavailable to the general\n      public. Such caricature, lampooning or parody may be\n      expressed in a variety of ways, i.e. cartoons in newspapers,\n      mime, theatre, even films, songs, etc. Such forms of\n      expression cannot be held to amount to commercial\n      exploitation, per se; if the individual is of the view that the\n      form of expression defames or disparages him, the remedy of\n      damages for libel, or slander, as the case may be, would then,\n      is available to him.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_91\">      15. An individual claiming false endorsement must prove\n      that the use of the identity likely misled consumers into\n      believing the concerned personality endorsed the product at\n      issue. In this case, it has seen that the use of Mr. Mehndi&#x27;s\n      persona for the purpose of capitalizing upon his name by using\n      its conjunction with the commercial product is not proper or\n      legitimate; it amounts to a clear dilution of uniqueness of\n      such personality and gives rise to a false belief that, plaintiff\n      has either licensed or the Defendants have some connection\n      with them (i.e. the plaintiff or the artist), to use its exclusive\n      right to market images of the artist.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_92\">      16. In a passing off action, one has to see as to whether the\n      Defendant is selling goods/service so marked to be designed\n      or calculated to lead purchasers to believe that they are\n      plaintiffs goods. Even if a person uses another&#x27;s well-known\n      trademark or trade mark similar thereto for goods or services\n      that are not similar to those provided by such other person,\n      although it does not cause confusion among consumers as to\n      the source of goods or services, it may cause damage to the\n      well-known trade mark by reducing or diluting the trademarks\n      power to indicate the source. Further, where a person uses\n      another person&#x27;s well-known trade mark or trademark similar\n      thereto for the purpose of diluting the trade mark, such use\n      does not cause confusion among consumers but takes\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_104\">                                                          Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_105\">                                                          Digitally Signed By:AMIT</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_106\">                                                          BANSAL</span>\n\nCS(COMM) 108/2023                                              Page\n                                                          Signing      33 of 51 13:09:16\n                                                                  Date:26.04.2023\n                                 2023:DHC:2796\n\n\n\n\n       advantage of the goodwill of the well-known trade mark, it\n       constitutes an act of unfair competition.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_52\">45.    A holistic reading of the aforesaid observations would demonstrate\nthat while the Court recognized the right of publicity of an individual, the\nCourt also observed that the said right is not unrestricted and cannot be\noveremphasized in light of the right to freedom of speech enshrined under\n<a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_25\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution. By way of illustration, Bhat, J., carved\nout certain exceptions such as caricature, lampooning, parodies and the like,\nthat may not constitute infringement of an individual&#x27;s right to publicity.\nThe learned Judge went on to say that the aforesaid usage can be by way of\ncartoons, mime, theatre or even films and songs. It was further observed that\nif the aforesaid use defames an individual, his remedy would be by way of a\nsuit for defamation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_53\">46.

In\nmy reading of the judgment, the observations made in D.M.

This case involved the defendant putting up hoardings depicting\nAmitabh Bachchan and Jaya Bachchan as the endorser of the defendant&#x27;s\njewellery.

Accordingly, it was alleged\nin the plaint that the defendant is misleading the public into believing that\nthe defendant&#x27;s jewellery is associated with the plaintiff&#x27;s brand of\njewellery. In the aforesaid background, the learned Single Judge of this\nCourt held that the advertisement of the defendant suggests an endorsement\nof his jewellery by Amitabh Bachchan and Jaya Bachchan and would\namount to an infringement of their right of publicity. Clearly, the\nobservations made by the learned Single Judge with regard to right of\npublicity were in the context of false endorsement and advertising.

In the absence of a specific legislation, the right to publicity cannot be\nan absolute right in India.

In view of the discussion above, in my opinion, the violation of the\nright of publicity in India has to be considered on the touchstone of the\ncommon law wrong of passing off, as also weighed against the &#x27;right to\nfreedom of speech and expression&#x27; enshrined under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_37\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the\nConstitution. &#x27;Passing off,&#x27; though a remedy under common law, is\nreferenced in statutory law in India7. It has been recognized in various\njudgments of the Supreme Court and High Courts. The action of passing off\nis based on the foundation of deceit and misrepresentation. Reference in this\nregard may be made to <a href=\"/doc/529384/\" id=\"a_38\">Kaviraj Pandit Durga Dutt Sharma v. Navratna\nPharmaceutical Laboratories</a>, AIR 1965 SC 980. In my considered view,\nthe very same principles that are applied in the case of passing off, will have\nto be applied for determining infringement of the right of publicity. Where\nthe identity or the image of a celebrity is used to promote the sale of a\nproduct or a service or to show its endorsement by the celebrity or an\nassociation with the celebrity, without their consent, it would amount to\nmisrepresentation and cause likelihood of confusion in the market.

Applying the aforesaid principles in the context of an OFS game, it\ncannot be denied that various OFS platforms use names and images of\ncelebrity and other information available in public domain. It is also a matter\nof fact that OFS platforms use such information with regard to all available\nplayers and not in respect of a few selected players. As illustrated in the\njudgments of C.B.C. (supra) and Daniels (supra), even in the U.S., where\nright of publicity is a statutory right in certain States, the courts have held\nthat use of celebrity name, image and other information available in public\ndomain would not amount to infringement of the right of publicity in the\ncontext of OFS. In my considered view, the use of the name and/or the\nimage of a celebrity along with data with regard to his on-field performances\nby OFS platforms is protected by the right to freedom of speech and\nexpression under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_43\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution of India. It is a settled\nposition of law that protection under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_44\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> extends to commercial\nspeech as well9. Therefore, even if the defendants are using players&#x27; names,\nimages and statistics for commercial gain, this would be protected under\n<a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_45\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution of India.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_72\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"125596\" id=\"span_135\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"752455\" id=\"span_136\">59.    Nor would the aforesaid use by OFS operators amount to\ninfringement of the common law right of publicity.

Now, I proceed to apply the aforesaid principles to the facts of the\npresent case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_75\">61.     From a perusal of the digital downloads of the Striker Website filed\nby the plaintiffs, the scenario that emerges is as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_94\">   i.   The defendant no.2&#x27;s game, Striker, is an OFS game.\n  ii.   To play the game, the user requires player cards as entry tokens.\n iii.   The entry tokens/NFT Player Cards use the players&#x27; names and the\n        original artistic rendition of the players.\n</blockquote><pre id=\"pre_22\"> iv.    The team comprises of five players.\n  v.    The     user   gets   a    certain   number    of     points         based         on\n</pre><blockquote id=\"blockquote_95\">        performance/statistics of its players in a real cricket match.\n vi.    The Digital Player Cards can be traded as well as rented on the\n        platform of the defendant no.2.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_96\">vii.    The said defendant has created additional feature on the Digital Player\n        Cards, in the form of experience points (XP) and health points (HP),\n        which impact the points earned by a user in the real match.\nviii.   Defendants also use five different kinds of Digital Player Card rarities\n        which have different values as they impact the points earned by the\n        player.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_97\"> ix.    Since the Digital Player Cards are NFT enabled, they have a unique\n        identity and token number, as recorded in the blockchain. The NFT\n        enablement ensures (a) digital certificate of authenticity; (b) proof of\n        ownership; and, (c) transaction history.\n</blockquote>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_141\">                                                              Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_142\">                                                              Digitally Signed By:AMIT</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_143\">                                                              BANSAL</span>\n\n<pre id=\"pre_23\">CS(COMM) 108/2023                                                  Page\n                                                              Signing      41 of 51 13:09:16\n                                                                      Date:26.04.2023\n                                2023:DHC:2796\n\n\n\n\n</pre><blockquote id=\"blockquote_98\"> x.   Digital Player Cards of all the current players are available on the\n      website.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_76\">62.   The aforesaid features have been added by Striker so as to\ndifferentiate its game from other OFS. Therefore, on the Striker platform,\nthe outcome of the game is the function of four factors, namely, (i) a\nplayer&#x27;s on-field performance; (ii) XP; (iii) HP; and, (iv) the Player Card\nrarity. Out of the aforesaid four factors, a player&#x27;s on-field performance is\nclearly available in the public domain and the remaining three factors are\nspecially created by the defendant and have no relation to the player.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_77\">63.   The information used by Striker i.e., player name and                          data\nconcerning a player&#x27;s real-word match performance, is freely available in\nthe public domain and can be used by anyone. It is not the plaintiffs&#x27; case\nthat the defendants are using any personal information such as the height\nand weight of the players, which is not in the public domain. The\ninformation which is available in public domain cannot be owned by\nanybody, including the players themselves. Therefore, such publicly\navailable information cannot be the subject matter of an exclusive license by\nthe player in favour of a third party. Similar view has also been taken by\nU.S. courts in C.B.C. (supra) and Daniels (supra), as discussed above.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_78\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"66104323\" id=\"span_144\">64.   Facts which are available in public domain such as match information\ncannot be monopolized and even if a third-party were to publish such\ninformation for commercial gain, no actionable right arises in favour of the\nplaintiffs. A Division Bench of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/66104323/\" id=\"a_48\">Akuate Internet Services Pvt.\nLtd. and Anr. v. Star India Pvt.

In the aforesaid case, the plaintiff filed a suit for permanent\ninjunction and damages alleging that the defendants had violated &quot;mobile\nrights&quot; and &quot;mobile activation rights&quot; of the plaintiffs that were exclusively\nassigned to the plaintiffs by the BCCI. A learned Single Judge of this Court\ngranted injunction in favour of the plaintiffs. In appeal, the Division Bench\nreversed the judgment of the learned Single Judge by observing that facts\nand information that are available in public domain cannot be claimed as an\nexclusive property of an entity and such information cannot be licensed by\nthe said entity in favour of another. Resultantly, even if the defendants are\nusing the information available in public domain in the course of commerce,\nno injunction can be granted in favour of the plaintiffs.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_79\">65.   It is also relevant to note that Striker uses artwork of the players on its\nDigital Player Cards and not the actual photographs. These artworks contain\ncreative elements that distinguish them from the actual image of the players\nin question. As noted above, the Supreme Court of California in DC Comics\n(supra) held that when a work contains significant number of transformative\nelements or creative contributions, they become the defendant&#x27;s own\nexpression rather than the celebrities&#x27; likeness and would therefore be\nentitled to the protection under the First Amendment. As noted in Cardtoons\n(supra), the use of transformative elements and artistic contributions in the\nplayer cards of the defendants would be in the nature of caricature, which\nwould constitute permissive use. Such use, in my view, would also be\nprotected under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_49\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution of India.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_80\">66.   It may also be relevant to note that the plaintiffs concede that they\nhave no exclusive right over the players&#x27; names, photographs/image and\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_148\">                                                            Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_149\">                                                            Digitally Signed By:AMIT</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_150\">                                                            BANSAL</span>\n\nCS(COMM) 108/2023                                                Page\n                                                            Signing      43 of 51 13:09:16\n                                                                    Date:26.04.2023\n                               2023:DHC:2796\n\n\n\n\nperformance statistics that are used in an ordinary OFS game. Therefore,\nthey do not have any grievance with regard to the aforesaid player\ninformation being used in an ordinary OFS game that does not use NFT\ntechnology for their Digital Player Cards. Their grievance is only with the\nuse of the NFT enabled Digital Player Cards that can be traded.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_81\">67.   To a pointed query from the Court as to whether the plaintiff would\nhave any grievance if a Digital Player Card is used only for playing a game\nand not for trading, senior counsel appearing on behalf of the plaintiffs\nreplied in the negative. On a further query as to what is the difference\nbetween use of image in an OFS game as against the use of an image in an\nNFT card, senior counsel on behalf of plaintiffs submitted that in an OFS\ngame, the image/photograph is used only as a matter of reference to identify\nthe player.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_82\">68.   The primary use and the function of a Digital Player Card in the\ncontext of the Striker platform is for the purposes of playing an OFS game.\nLike in the case of an ordinary OFS platform, the OFS games with NFT\nPlayer Cards also use the NFT Player Cards essentially for the purposes of\nplayer identification to form a fantasy team to compete with other users on\nthe same platform. The trading of the Digital Player Cards is a feature\nadded by the defendant no.2 in its OFS so as to enable users to make\nchanges in their teams by trading one or more players with others. It is\ncommon knowledge that trading of players is a part and parcel of all\nprofessional sporting leagues in the world. For instance, the management of\na professional football club in the English Premium League (EPL) would\noften trade one or more players for others. The trading value of a player\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_151\">                                                        Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_152\">                                                        Digitally Signed By:AMIT</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_153\">                                                        BANSAL</span>\n\nCS(COMM) 108/2023                                            Page\n                                                        Signing      44 of 51 13:09:16\n                                                                Date:26.04.2023\n                                 2023:DHC:2796\n\n\n\n\nwould depend upon the performances of the players as well as the demand\nand supply for that player. Similarly, the defendant no.2 enables a user to\nwear the hat of a manager of a team so as to enable him to trade in players.\nThis is nothing but an innovative feature in the OFS platform of defendant\nno.2 to enhance the user experience. However, this would not change the\nnature and character of the platform of defendant no.2 from being an OFS\nplatform to a trading platform per se. Any person who trades or rents the\naforesaid cards would primarily be doing so for the purpose of the game,\nthough in theory, it may be possible to buy and sell the Digital Player Cards\nwithout playing the game. In this context, a reference may be made to the\nterms and conditions on the Striker Website, the relevant portion of which is\nset out below:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_99\">        &quot;We offer a website/app that provides and provides Users the\n        opportunity to collect, trade (buy/sell), store, or display digital\n        cards (&#x27;Cards&#x27;) for playing online fantasy games (&#x27;Game&#x27;)\n        organised on www.striker.club (&#x27;Site&#x27;), partner website(s),\n        mobile application(s) and other portal(s) (&#x27;Platform&#x27;).&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_83\">69.     Therefore, in my prima facie view, the NFT Player Cards are in fact\n&#x27;in-game&#x27; assets to be used for enhancing the experience of playing the\ngame.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_84\">70.     The plaintiffs have also submitted that the defendant no.2 is using the\nnames and artworks of sportspersons on NFT technology enabled Digital\nPlayer Cards without obtaining any authorization/license from the concerned\nsportspersons. If the name or image of a player can be used in an ordinary\nOFS game for descriptive or nominative purposes, there is no reason as to\nwhy it cannot be used for the same purposes on a Digital Player Card.\nTherefore, in my considered view, there is no difference between an OFS\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_154\">                                                           Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_155\">                                                           Digitally Signed By:AMIT</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_156\">                                                           BANSAL</span>\n\nCS(COMM) 108/2023                                               Page\n                                                           Signing      45 of 51 13:09:16\n                                                                   Date:26.04.2023\n                                2023:DHC:2796\n\n\n\n\ngame with NFT enabled Player Cards and an ordinary OFS game insofar as\nuse of the name or artistic impression/photograph of a player is concerned.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_85\">71.   The plaintiffs cannot claim to have an exclusive right over the use of\nan NFT technology. NFT is a technology that is freely available. The\ndefendants used the NFT technology to ensure security and authenticity as a\nmeans of proof of ownership of its cards and to keep a record of transactions\non a blockchain.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_86\">72.   Major grievance of the plaintiffs emerges from the fact that Digital\nPlayer Cards are traded on the platform of the defendant no.2 at huge prices\nand the defendant no.2 earns commission on the same. As per the plaintiffs,\nthis amounts to the defendants capitalizing on the personality rights of the\nplayers. The plaintiffs contended that the high price on the NFT Player\nCards is on account of the persona of the player on the card. I do not agree\nwith this submission. As discussed earlier, the price of a Digital Player Card\non the Striker platform would depend upon various factors such as (i) rarity\nof the card; (ii) on-field performance of the player; (iii) XP and HP factors\non the card, which are game related features; and, (iv) most importantly, the\ndemand and supply in the market. In respect of the same cricketer, the price\nof the card may be higher if the card is of a higher rarity as compared to a\ncard of a lower rarity. Similarly, in respect of the same player, the card with\na higher HP would possibly fetch a higher price.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_87\">73.   The plaintiffs have also compared the selling and trading of NFTs on\nthe Striker platform as akin to a bat of a cricketer being sold with his\nautograph without his authorization. In my view, this analogy is completely\nmisplaced. Unlike a bat which is signed by a particular player, the NFT\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_157\">                                                          Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_158\">                                                          Digitally Signed By:AMIT</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_159\">                                                          BANSAL</span>\n\nCS(COMM) 108/2023                                              Page\n                                                          Signing      46 of 51 13:09:16\n                                                                  Date:26.04.2023\n                                2023:DHC:2796\n\n\n\n\nPlayer Cards in the present case do not have any such signature/autograph or\nanything to establish a connection, license or endorsement from a player.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_88\">74.

However, the defendants do not claim to\nbe selling or trading in any video moments or cricket artefacts or officially\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_160\">                                                           Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_161\">                                                           Digitally Signed By:AMIT</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_162\">                                                           BANSAL</span>\n\nCS(COMM) 108/2023                                               Page\n                                                           Signing      47 of 51 13:09:16\n                                                                   Date:26.04.2023\n                                2023:DHC:2796\n\n\n\n\nlicensed player cards/video moments/cricket artifacts. A perusal of the\nDigital Player Cards being used by the defendants on the Striker platform\nwould show that the said cards do not suggest any kind of endorsement or\nassociation with the player concerned. Nor do they claim that the cards have\nbeen autographed or officially licensed by the players. Further, the NFT\nPlayer Cards offered by Striker do not contain the original photograph of a\nplayer and only use artwork. Therefore, unlike the plaintiff no.1, the\ndefendant no.2 is not projecting its Digital Player Cards as collectibles. A\ncollector or a fan of a player would be less inclined to buy such a card as\nmemorabilia when other NFTs using the actual photograph/video moments\nof sportspersons are available to purchase on the Rario platform.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_92\">78.   Since the Digital Player Cards are available for all current players that\nare available for selection, it cannot be said that the defendants are claiming\nany endorsement from a player or promoting its game on the basis of the\npersonality of a player. In this regard, reference may be made to the\nfollowing observations of the United States Court of Appeal for the 8th Cir.\nin C.B.C. (supra):\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_101\">      &quot;nor is there any danger here that consumers will be misled,\n      because the fantasy baseball games depend on the inclusion of\n      all players and thus cannot create a false impression that some\n      particular player with &#x27;Star Power&#x27; is endorsing CBC&#x27;s\n      products.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_93\">79.   The plaintiffs have argued that by using the name and artwork of a\nplayer&#x27;s image/photograph on their cards, the defendants are unjustly\nenriching themselves at the expense of the sportsperson concerned. I do not\nfind merit in this submission. As noted in C.B.C. (supra), sportspersons are\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_163\">                                                          Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_164\">                                                          Digitally Signed By:AMIT</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_165\">                                                          BANSAL</span>\n\nCS(COMM) 108/2023                                              Page\n                                                          Signing      48 of 51 13:09:16\n                                                                  Date:26.04.2023\n                                2023:DHC:2796\n\n\n\n\nrewarded handsomely by their participation in the games, as also through\nendorsements and sponsorship arrangements. In the context of the present\ncase also, it is a known fact that Indian cricketers earn huge amounts\nthrough Indian Premier League auctions, BCCI contracts, match fees,\nbesides various brand endorsements and other sponsorships.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_94\">80.    The defendants submit that the plaintiffs have deliberately not\ndisclosed in the plaint that the Rario platform also offers an OFS game,\nbeing &quot;D3.Club,&quot; which is similar to Striker. This submission has not been\nrebutted by the plaintiffs. A perusal of the documents would reveal the\nfollowing similarities between the Rario and the Striker platforms:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_102\">  i.   Both plaintiff no.1 and the defendant use NFT Player Cards of the\n       players in relation to the games.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_103\"> ii.   Buying and selling of the Digital Player Cards can be from the\n       website, from other players in the marketplace or third-party\n       marketplace, Good Game Exchange.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_104\">iii.   Both plaintiff no.1 and the defendant no.2 use blockchain technology\n       to ensure security and proof of ownership.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_95\">81.    The defendants, along with their reply to the application for interim\ninjunction, have placed on record screenshots of WhatsApp conversations\nbetween officials of the plaintiffs and the defendants to show that the\nplaintiffs were aware of the launch of the Striker platform by the defendants\nin September/October, 2022. It is hard to believe that the plaintiff no.1, who\nwas already in business then, was not aware of the said launch. Yet, the\nplaintiff filed the present suit only on 24th February, 2023, just before the\nstart of the Women&#x27;s Premier League and the Indian Premier League. It is\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_166\">                                                          Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_167\">                                                          Digitally Signed By:AMIT</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_168\">                                                          BANSAL</span>\n\nCS(COMM) 108/2023                                              Page\n                                                          Signing      49 of 51 13:09:16\n                                                                  Date:26.04.2023\n                                 2023:DHC:2796\n\n\n\n\nalso pertinent to mention that the suit was filed along with an application\nseeking exemption from advance service on the defendants. It is a different\nmatter that the counsel for the defendants appeared on the date when the suit\nalong with the interim applications were listed before this Court for the first\ntime on 28th February, 2023 and the defendants were consequently granted\ntime to file reply.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_96\">82.    Considering that the defendants were already running their game for\nalmost six months and the grant of an ex parte injunction order would have\ngravely prejudiced the business of the defendants, who are direct\ncompetitors of the plaintiff no.1 in the OFS industry, the application filed on\nbehalf of the plaintiff seeking exemption from advance service, in my\nopinion, was not bona fide.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_97\">83.    Even on the parameter of balance of convenience and irreparable\nharm, I am of the view that these factors are in favour of the defendants and\nagainst the plaintiffs. An injunction granted at this stage would result in\nclosure of the business of the defendant no.2 and would cause huge financial\nlosses not only to defendant no.2 but also to the users of the Striker\nplatform. On the other hand, in the event the plaintiff succeeds in the suit, it\ncan always be compensated.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_98\">84.    In view of the discussion above, the plaintiffs have failed to make out\na case for grant of interim injunction.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_99\">85.    Accordingly, I.A. 3960/2023 is dismissed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_100\">86.
