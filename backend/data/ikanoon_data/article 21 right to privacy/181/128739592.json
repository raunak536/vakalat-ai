The appellant and on behalf of the respondent Mridula G., CPIO, attended the\nhearing through video conference.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_6\">6.      The appellant inter alia submitted that the respondent had wrongly denied the\ninformation sought in point nos 2,3,4 and 7 of the RTI application. He further argued that\nthe denial of information not only vitiates the principles of transparency but he also\nrelied upon the latest judicial pronouncement dated 07.02.2025 passed by Hon&#x27;ble\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                                                                Page 3 of 17</span>\n Supreme Court in Public Information Officer &amp; Registrar &amp; Anr. Vs. Onkar Dattaray\nKalmankar &amp; Anr. [Special Leave to Appeal (C) Nos. 2783/2025], wherein the following\nhas been observed:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">      &quot;We see absolutely no reason to interfere with the impugned order passed by the\n      High Court of Bombay, which has correctly interpreted the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_3\">Section\n      8(1) (j)</a> of the Right to Information Act 2005 (for short &#x27;the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_4\">RTI Act, 2005</a>&#x27;). The\n      issue relates to disclosure of marks of other candidate in an examination. We are\n      also of the view that the disclosure of the marks though may fall in the category of\n      personal information, yet the disclosure of this personal information is presently\n      necessary in public interest, and therefore, it is not an information which cannot\n      be given by the Information Officer under the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_5\">RTI Act, 2005</a>. To the contrary, such\n      an information must be disclosed in order to maintain transparency in the\n      process.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_7\">      He insisted upon the information sought in point no. 7 of the RTI application i.e.\ndisclosure of marks obtained by other candidates in the selection process, while relying\nupon the directions passed in a recent judicial pronouncement of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme\nCourt in Public Information Officer &amp; Registrar &amp; Anr. Vs. Onkar Dattaray Kalmankar\n&amp; Anr. [Special Leave to Appeal (C) Nos. 2783/2025], extracted as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">      &quot;51. Since we have found that the disclosure of the marks obtained by the\n      candidates in the written test, typing test and interviewers did not constitute any\n      exempted information or did not affect the confidentiality of the exam so\n      conducted, we must say that the approach of the District authorities in Wardha\n      contributed to the promotion of transparency which should typically be promoted\n      in matters of public recruitment. Withholding such information unnecessarily\n      allows doubts, however unreasonable, to linger, which is not very healthy in\n      promoting transparency and accountability in the working of public authorities\n      and public recruitment processes. Regarding RTI, it is repeatedly asserted that\n      sunlight is the best disinfectant.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                                                                Page 4 of 17</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\"> 7.     The respondent while defending their case inter alia submitted that they had\ndisclosed the list of selected candidates against point no. 6 of the RTI application.\nHowever, the marks obtained by the other candidates (third-parties) in the interview\nprocess qualify as their personal information, hence, the same was not disclosed to the\nappellant, as per provisions under <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 8 (1) (j)</a> of the RTI Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_9\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"24565734\" id=\"span_5\">8.     The Commission after adverting to the facts and circumstances of the case, hearing\nboth parties and perusal of records, observes that the respondent replied on 04.03.2024\nand provided a point-wise reply to the appellant. While the CPIO partly disclosed\ninformation with respect to certain points, the information sought in point no. 7 of the\nRTI application i.e. Interview Panel members award of marks for MMGS-III for all\ncandidates under their signature, was denied under <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 8 (1) (j)</a> of the RTI Act.

However, the bench is of the considered opinion that since the appellant has\nreferred to interview marks obtained by all candidates, it is a matter of judicial discipline\nand propriety to rely on the Apex Court&#x27;s Constitution bench judgment in the matter of\nCentral Public Information Officer, Supreme Court of <a href=\"/doc/155236387/\" id=\"a_9\">India Vs. Subhash Chandra\nAgarwal</a> in Civil Appeal No. 10044 of 2010 with Civil Appeal No. 10045 of 2010 and\nCivil Appeal No. 2683 of 2010 wherein the import of &quot;personal information&quot; envisaged\nunder <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of RTI Act has been exemplified in the context of earlier ratios <a href=\"/doc/155236387/\" id=\"a_11\">laid\ndown by</a> the same Court in the matter(<a href=\"/doc/140349586/\" id=\"a_12\">s) of Canara Bank Vs.

Similarly, professional records, including qualification,\n       performance, evaluation reports, ACRs, disciplinary proceedings, etc. are all\n       personal information. Medical records, treatment, choice of medicine, list of\n       hospitals and doctors visited, findings recorded, including that of the family\n       members, information relating to assets, liabilities, income tax returns, details of\n       investments, lending and borrowing, etc. are personal information.

It is noted that the extent of disclosure demanded by the appellant is not only\nlimited to the finally selected list of candidates but to all other candidates participating in\nthe selection process. Now, to allow such a prayer would adversely affect the right to\nprivacy of all such unselected candidates who are entitled to the protection of their\nfundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution of India. Now, to arrive at the\naforesaid deduction, in the facts of the instant matter it is imperative to read the preface\nor the genesis/discussion, wherefrom the above deduction was arrived at by the Apex\nCourt.

This observation highlights the status and\nimportance of the right to privacy as a constitutional right. The ratio as recorded\nin the two concurring judgments of 26 (2017) 10 SCC 1 the learned judges (R.F.\nNariman and Sanjay Kishan Kaul, JJ.) are similar. It is observed that privacy\ninvolves a person&#x27;s right to his physical body; right to informational privacy\nwhich deals with a person&#x27;s mind; and the right to privacy of choice which\nprotects an individual&#x27;s autonomy over personal choices. While physical privacy\nenjoys constitutional recognition in <a href=\"/doc/1024002/\" id=\"a_20\">Article 19(1)(d)</a> and (e) read with <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_21\">Article 21</a>,\npersonal informational privacy is relatable to <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_22\">Article 21</a> and right to privacy of\nchoice is enshrined in <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_23\">Articles 19(1)(a)</a> to (c), 20(3), 21 and 25 of the Constitution.\nIn the concurring opinion, there is a reference to &#x27;The Right to Privacy&#x27; by Samuel\nWarren and Louis D. Brandeis on an individual&#x27;s right to control the\ndissemination of personal information and that an individual has a right to limit\naccess to such information/shield such information from unwarranted access.\nKnowledge about a person gives another power over that person, as personal\ndata collected is capable of effecting representations in his decision making\nprocess and shaping behaviour which can have a stultifying effect on the\nexpression of dissent which is the cornerstone of democracy. In the said\nconcurring judgment, it has been further held that the right to protection of\nreputation from being unfairly harmed needs to be zealously guarded not only\nagainst falsehood but also against certain truths by observing: (Emphasis\nSupplied)\n\n&#x27;623. An individual has a right to protect his reputation from being unfairly\nharmed and such protection of reputation needs to exist not only against falsehood\nbut also certain truths. It cannot be said that a more accurate judgment about\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                                                                           Page 7 of 17</span>\n people can be facilitated by knowing private details about their lives - people\njudge us badly, they judge us in haste, they judge out of context, they judge without\nhearing the whole story and they judge with hypocrisy. Privacy lets people protect\nthemselves from these troublesome judgments.&#x27;\n\nxxx</span>\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">43. Privacy and confidentiality encompass a bundle of rights including the right\nto protect identity and anonymity. Anonymity is where an individual seeks\nfreedom from identification, even when and despite being in a public space....\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">xxx\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">46........ In the context of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_24\">RTI Act</a>, suffice would be to say that the right to\nprotect identity and anonymity would be identically subjected to the public\ninterest test.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">47. Clause (j) to sub-section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 8</a> of the RTI Act specifically refers to\ninvasion of the right to privacy of an individual and excludes from disclosure\ninformation that would cause unwarranted invasion of privacy of such individual,\nunless the disclosure would satisfy the larger public interest test. This clause also\ndraws a distinction in its treatment of personal information, whereby disclosure of\nsuch information is exempted if such information has no relation to public activity\nor interest. We would like to, however, clarify that in their treatment of this\nexemption, this Court has treated the word &#x27;information&#x27; which if disclosed would\nlead to invasion of privacy to mean personal information, as distinct from public\ninformation. This aspect has been dealt with in the succeeding paragraphs.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">48. As per Black&#x27;s Law Dictionary, 8th Edition, the word &#x27;personal&#x27; means &#x27;of or\naffecting a person or of or constituting personal property&#x27;....\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">xxx\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">51. This test had been adopted in several English decisions including decision of\nthe House of Lords in Campbell v. Mirror Group Newspapers Limited33 wherein\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                                                                          Page 8 of 17</span>\n Lord Hope of Craighead had further elucidated that the definition is taken from\nthe definition of &#x27;privacy&#x27; in the United States, where the right to privacy is\ninvaded if the matter which is publicised is of a kind that - (a) would be highly\noffensive to a reasonable person and (b) not of legitimate concern to the public.\nLaw of privacy in Campbell (supra), it was observed, was not intended for the\nprotection of the unduly sensitive and would cover matters which are offensive and\nobjectionable to a reasonable man of ordinary sensibilities who must expect some\nreporting of his daily activities. The mind that has to be examined is not that of a\nreader in general, but that of the person who is affected by the\npublicising/dissemination of his information. The question is what a reasonable\nperson of ordinary sensibilities would feel if he/she is subjected to such publicity.\nOnly when publicity is such that a reasonable person would feel justified in feeling\nseriously aggrieved that there would be an invasion in the right to privacy which\ngives rise to a cause of action.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">52. In Douglas (supra), it was also held that there are different degrees of privacy\nwhich would be equally true for information given in confidentiality, and the\npotential for disclosure of the information to cause harm is an important factor to\nbe taken into account in the assessment of the extent of the restriction to protect\nthe right to privacy.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">53. While clause (j) exempts disclosure of two kinds of information, as noted in\nparagraph 47 above, that is &quot;personal information&quot; with no relation to public\nactivity or interest and &quot;information&quot; that is exempt from disclosure to prevent\nunwarranted invasion of privacy, this Court has not underscored, as will be seen\nbelow, such distinctiveness and treated personal information to be exempt from\ndisclosure if such disclosure invades on balance the privacy rights, thereby linking\nthe former kind of information with the latter kind. This means that information,\nwhich if disclosed could lead to an unwarranted invasion of privacy rights, would\nmean personal information, that is, which is not having co-relation with public\ninformation.\n</blockquote>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                                                                          Page 9 of 17</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\"> 54. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"160205361\" id=\"span_17\">In <a href=\"/doc/160205361/\" id=\"a_26\">Girish Ramchandra Deshpande v.

The expression &#x27;public interest&#x27; has to be understood in its true connotation\n         so as to give complete meaning to the relevant provisions of the Act. The\n         expression &#x27;public interest&#x27; must be viewed in its strict sense with all its exceptions\n         so as to justify denial of a statutory exemption in terms of the Act. In its common\n         parlance, the expression &#x27;public interest&#x27;, like &#x27;public purpose&#x27;, is not capable of\n         any precise definition. It does not have a rigid meaning, is elastic and takes its\n         colour from the statute in which it occurs, the concept varying with time and state\n         of society and its needs. [State of Bihar v. Kameshwar Singh (AIR1952 SC 252)].\n         It also means the general welfare of the public that warrants recommendation and\n         protection; something in which the public as a whole has a stake [Black&#x27;s Law\n         Dictionary (Eighth Edition)]. Emphasis Supplied\n\n\n         &quot;24. The satisfaction has to be arrived at by the authorities objectively and the\n         consequences of such disclosure have to be weighed with regard to circumstances\n         of a given case. The decision has to be based on objective satisfaction recorded for\n         ensuring that larger public interest outweighs unwarranted invasion of privacy or\n         other factors stated in the provision. Certain matters, particularly in relation to\n         appointment, are required to be dealt with great confidentiality.&quot;\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                                                                                    Page 12 of 17</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_38\">       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1294854\" id=\"span_25\">&quot;....

All these protections have to be given their due implementation as\n      they spring from statutory exemptions. It is not a decision simpliciter between\n      private interest and public interest. It is a matter where a constitutional\n      protection is available to a person with regard to the right to privacy. Thus, the\n      public interest has to be construed while keeping in mind the balance factor\n      between right to privacy and right to information with the purpose sought to be\n      achieved and the purpose that would be served in the larger public interest,\n      particularly when both these rights emerge from the constitutional values under\n      the Constitution of India.&quot; Emphasis Supplied\n\n      Similarly, in another judgment of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in the matter of <a href=\"/doc/1294854/\" id=\"a_38\">S.

Public interest in access to information refers to something that is in the\n      interest of the public welfare to know. Public welfare is widely different from what\n      is of interest to the public. &quot;Something which is of interest to the public&quot; and\n      &quot;something which is in the public interest&quot; are two separate and different\n      parameters. For example, the public may be interested in private matters with\n      which the public may have no concern and pressing need to know. However, such\n      interest of the public in private matters would repudiate and directly traverse the\n      protection of privacy.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_42\">      The object and purpose behind the specific exemption vide clause (j) to <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_41\">Section\n      8(1)</a> is to protect and shield oneself from unwarranted access to personal\n      information and to protect facets like reputation, honour, etc. associated with\n      the right to privacy. Similarly, there is a public interest in the maintenance of\n      confidentiality in the case of private individuals and even government, an aspect\n      we have already discussed.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_43\">      76. The public interest test in the context of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_42\">RTI Act</a> would mean reflecting\n      upon the object and purpose behind the right to information, the right to privacy\n      and consequences of invasion, and breach of confidentiality and possible harm\n      and injury that would be caused to the third party, with reference to a particular\n      information and the person. In an article &#x27;Freedom of Information and the Public\n      Interest: the Commonwealth experience&#x27; published in the Oxford University\n      Commonwealth Law Journal, the factors identified as favouring disclosure, those\n      against disclosure and lastly those irrelevant for consideration of public interest\n      have been elucidated as under:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_44\">      &quot;it is generally accepted that the public interest is not synonymous with what is\n      of interest to the public, in the sense of satisfying public curiosity about some\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">                                                                               Page 14 of 17</span>\n       matter.
