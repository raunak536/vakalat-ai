Another argument put-forth on behalf of the plaintiff is that by\n                                    inducing the plaintiff to disclose the money taken by her from her\n                                    daughter towards purchase of the apartment, defendant No.1 has\n                                    induced the plaintiff to breach her own privacy.

At the outset it must be observed, that this matter has proceeded in a\n                                    somewhat unusual manner.

The plaintiff asserts that\n                                    the source of the funds used by her to buy the apartment are\n                                    legitimate and accounted-for; and more specifically, that she had fully\n                                    disclosed the acquisition of the apartment, including the source of\n                                    funds, to her parent Ministry viz. the Ministry of External Affairs at\n                                    the relevant time.

Most importantly, the plaintiff explains that the financing of the\n                                    apartment was quite straightforward. The total cost of purchase of the\n                                    apartment was Swiss Francs i.e. CHF 1.6 million; of which, the\n                                    plaintiff obtained CHF 1.0 million as loan from UBS Bank, Geneva,\n                                    Switzerland against mortgage of the apartment; and the remaining\n                                    CHF 0.6 million was contributed by her elder daughter in 02 tranches\n                                    on 09.12.2004 and 11.03.2005. The plaintiff has filed as Document\n                                    No. 7 alongwith the plaint, a copy of the UBS Fixed-Rate Mortgage\n                                    dated 30.03.2005 for CHF 500,000/- and another contract for the UBS\n                                    Libor Mortgage dated 30.03.2005 for another sum of CHF 500,000/-\n                                    in her favour, to evidence that the sum of CHF 1.0 million was\n                                    borrowed from UBS for purchase of the apartment.

The plaintiff has also clarified that the monies\n                                    received from the daughter were somewhat in excess of the CHF 0.6\n                                    million required towards the balance price of the apartment, since\n                                    other processing charges and closing costs also had to be paid for\n                                    completing the purchase.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_99\">                             72.

Though\n                                               the plaintiff in the present case is no longer a public official, as\n                                               observed above, defendant No.1 has cleverly made insinuations\n                                               in the offending tweets not only to the plaintiff but also to her\n                                               husband who is a public official. For this reason, the decision in\n                                               R. Rajagopal is relevant. Furthermore, in R.

In the case of public officials, it is obvious, right to\n                                                  privacy, or for that matter, the remedy of action for damages is\n                                                  simply not available with respect to their acts and conduct\n                                                  relevant to the discharge of their official duties. This is so even\n                                                  where the publication is based upon facts and statements\n                                                  which are not true, unless the official establishes that the\n                                                  publication was made (by the defendant) with reckless\n                                                  disregard for truth. In such a case, it would be enough for the\n                                                  defendant (member of the press or media) to prove that he acted\n                                                  after a reasonable verification of the facts; it is not necessary\n                                                  for him to prove that what he has written is true. Of course,\n                                                  where the publication is proved to be false and actuated by\n                                                  malice or personal animosity, the defendant would have no\n                                                  defence and would be liable for damages. It is equally obvious\n                                                  that in matters not relevant to the discharge of his duties, the\n                                                  public official enjoys the same protection as any other citizen,\n                                                  as explained in (1) and (2) above.

On a careful understanding of the aforesaid dictum,\n                                                  I could see that the right of privacy of an individual is\n                                                  guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_21\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India and it\n                                                  is a right to be let alone.

As far as a public\n                                                  personality is concerned, the right of privacy is equivalent to\n                                                  that of an individual when it is not associated with the public\n                                                  life.

That the financial inability of the plaintiff to purchase the\n                                               apartment is evident from the disclosures contained in the\n                                               disclosure affidavits filed by the plaintiff‟s husband in 2018\n                                               and 2020 as part of the latter‟s nomination papers to the Rajya\n                                               Sabha.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_113\">                                    76.3.

Now, by way of the documents filed in support of the plaint, the\n                                    plaintiff has clearly and cogently explained the source of funds that\n                                    she had used to purchase the apartment. The cost of purchase of the\n                                    apartment and the quantum of funds available to the plaintiff from the\n                                    sources explained by her, add-up neatly. There remains no doubt as to\n                                    how the plaintiff funded the purchase of the apartment. What adds\n                                    further credibility to the plaintiff‟s explanation is the fact that, at the\n                                    relevant time, that is in 2005 itself, the plaintiff had also intimated to\n                                    her parent Ministry that she had purchased the apartment, also\n                                    disclosing the source of the funds used for the purpose. It adds further\n                                    credence to the plaintiff‟s version when it is noticed that part of the\n                                    funds for purchase of the apartment came by way of a loan from a\n                                    well-known, well-established and old banking institution, namely\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_283\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_284\">Digitally Signed By:ANJALI</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_285\">KAUSHIK</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_286\">Signing Date:01.07.2024      CS(OS) 300/2021                                                        Page 49 of 62</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_287\">14:43:08</span>\n                                     UBS; and the remaining funds came through regular banking\n                                    channels from the plaintiff‟s own daughter.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_115\">                             78.    The fact that UBS loaned money to the plaintiff to purchase the\n                                    apartment is also well within the realm of acceptance, inasmuch as, at\n                                    the relevant time, the plaintiff and her husband were both well-placed\n                                    and serving in Geneva, Switzerland with secure, foreign currency\n                                    salaries/allowances.

In the opinion of this court, the evidence adduced by defendant No.1\n                                    by way of documents filed alongwith his written statement, do not\n                                    dislodge or belie the documents filed by the plaintiff in support of her\n                                    case. Therefore, defendant No.1‟s allegations against the plaintiff do\n                                    not sustain on point of fact.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_117\">                             80.    In light of the plaintiff‟s answers as regards the source of funds that\n                                    she used to purchase the apartment, this court is satisfied that what\n                                    has been stated by defendant No.1 in the offending tweets is evidently\n                                    incorrect, false and untrue.

In the present case, the plaintiff is a long retired civil servant, who is\n                                    currently not engaged in any governmental or public function; and the\n                                    financial transaction that was subject-matter of the offending tweets\n                                    dates back to 2005. One is therefore unable to see, on first blush, as to\n                                    why defendant No.1 was at all interested in a transaction that is so far\n                                    remote and antiquated, that it would be of no interest to anyone at this\n                                    time. Why then, did defendant No.1 rake-up this issue at such a late\n                                    stage. The answer is obvious. That defendant No.1 was interested, not\n                                    in the financial affairs of the plaintiff, but of the plaintiff‟s husband\n                                    who even today holds a ministerial post in the Central Government.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_120\">                             83.    A chronological reading of the offending tweets suggests, that to\n                                    begin with, defendant No.1 may not even have known in whose name\n                                    the apartment was held; and discovered only subsequently from the\n                                    disclosure affidavits filed by the plaintiff‟s husband that the apartment\n                                    was owned by the plaintiff and had been funded, atleast in part,\n                                    against a mortgage obtained from UBS Bank. Since persons seeking\n                                    election to Parliament are required to disclose not just their own assets\n                                    and liabilities, but also those of their spouse, there was perhaps\n                                    nothing amiss in defendant No.1 being curious as to the acquisition of\n                                    the apartment by the plaintiff. That being said however, the very least\n                                    defendant No.1 was required to do was to make further enquiries,\n                                    whether through direct queries addressed to the plaintiff or to her\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_293\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_294\">Digitally Signed By:ANJALI</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_295\">KAUSHIK</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_296\">Signing Date:01.07.2024      CS(OS) 300/2021                                                       Page 51 of 62</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_297\">14:43:08</span>\n                                     husband, or through queries made to competent authorities, to find out\n                                    as to how the plaintiff had funded the purchase of the apartment.\n                                    However, defendant No.1 did none of this; and straightaway fired a\n                                    salvo of tweets, making evident insinuations that the plaintiff (and her\n                                    husband) had funded the apartment through illicit means.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_121\">                             84.    In the present case, the plaintiff has without any doubt, served in\n                                    some of the highest positions in the civil services being an officer of\n                                    the Indian Foreign Service, including as an Ambassador of India to\n                                    more than one country and as an international civil servant working\n                                    for the United Nations. So has her husband. As noted above, after\n                                    having sought voluntary retirement from the Indian Foreign Service\n                                    some 13 years ago in 2011, the plaintiff has not held any public office\n                                    in India. Furthermore, the record shows that there was neither\n                                    anything suspect nor dishonourable in the plaintiff having acquired\n                                    the apartment in Geneva, Switzerland in 2005; nor was there the\n                                    plaintiff remiss in disclosing to the concerned authorities the purchase\n                                    of the apartment along with the source of funds. The record also\n                                    shows, that the doubt entertained by defendant No.1 in relation to the\n                                    purchase of the apartment, if it could be called that, arose in his mind\n                                    from the disclosures contained in the affidavits filed by the plaintiff‟s\n                                    husband as part of his nomination papers for the Rajya Sabha. What\n                                    defendant No.1 ought to have seen straightaway is that the purchase\n                                    of the apartment and the mortgage thereon from a well-established\n                                    international banking institution were duly disclosed in those\n                                    affidavits.

However,\n                                    without having any clarity, or by deliberately obfuscating matters,\n                                    defendant No.1 dragged both the plaintiff and her husband through\n                                    controversy insinuating financial impropriety in the purchase of the\n                                    apartment.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_124\">                             87.    All this creates serious doubt as to the motive and intention of\n                                    defendant No.1 in putting-out the offending tweets. If defendant\n                                    No.1‟s intention was only to put a bona-fide question to the plaintiff\n                                    or even to the plaintiff‟s husband, that may not itself have been\n                                    objectionable provided defendant No.1 had posed the question as a\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_303\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_304\">Digitally Signed By:ANJALI</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_305\">KAUSHIK</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_306\">Signing Date:01.07.2024      CS(OS) 300/2021                                                    Page 53 of 62</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_307\">14:43:08</span>\n                                      query and had waited for an answer before putting-out anything\n                                     further in the public domain.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_125\">                             88.     This court would hasten to observe that being the spouse of a person\n                                     holding public office, the plaintiff‟s financial affairs are also open to\n                                     public scrutiny. 26 However, it is necessary to draw a distinction\n                                     between a person‟s financial affairs being open to public scrutiny, by\n                                     requiring disclosure or clarification through legitimate means, which\n                                     may not amount to defamation; and a person being subjected to\n                                     vilification and to baseless and false ignominy, by asking tendentious\n                                     questions laced with innuendo. However, even before posing the\n                                     question with any seriousness, and without inviting any response from\n                                     the plaintiff, in his very first tweet, defendant No.1 added the\n                                     insinuation that the plaintiff had purchased the apartment with ill-\n                                     begotten wealth which warrants investigation by the Enforcement\n                                     Directorate. Defendant No.1 had also expressly imputed that the\n                                     plaintiff and her husband did not have the financial resources to\n                                     purchase the apartment. Defendant No.1 had further gone-on to say in\n                                     the initial offending tweets that action was called-for against the\n                                     plaintiff and her husband by investigating agencies, in-line with the\n                                     Government of India‟s stated policy to bring back ill-begotten wealth\n                                     that was stashed away abroad.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_126\">                             <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"15059075\" id=\"span_308\">89.     But was there any basis for defendant No.1 to jump to the conclusion\n                                     that the plaintiff or husband had accumulated ill-begotten wealth ?

Defendant No.1 made these insinuations without even making basic\n                                    enquiry from the plaintiff or her husband or from any other official\n                                    source. In para 26 of his written statement, defendant No.1 answers\n                                    this to say that he had done his due-diligence by relying upon the\n                                    disclosure affidavits filed by the plaintiff‟s husband, which were part\n                                    of the public record; and that therefore it was not necessary for him to\n                                    contact the plaintiff. In fact, as recorded in order dated 08.07.2021\n                                    learned counsel for defendant No.1 had argued that there is no law\n                                    that required defendant No.1 to seek any clarification either from the\n                                    plaintiff or from any competent public authority before putting-out the\n                                    offending tweets. In the opinion of this court, this stand taken by\n                                    defendant No.1 reflects brazen callousness, which cannot be\n                                    countenanced in law. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"547362\" id=\"span_316\">In the opinion of this court, this is mea-culpa as\n                                    to defendant No.1‟s reckless disregard for truth and flies in the face\n                                    of the legal position set-out by the Supreme Court in para 26(3) of <a href=\"/doc/547362/\" id=\"a_24\">R.\n                                    Rajagopal</a> (supra). Defendant No.1 himself says that his verification\n                                    of facts, as it were, was limited to perusing the disclosure affidavits\n                                    filed by the plaintiff‟s husband. This court is of the view, that that did\n                                    not amount to reasonable verification at all; and this court is therefore\n                                    satisfied that the offending tweets have been proved to be false and\n                                    actuated by malice in terms of what has been referred to in paragraph\n                                    26(3) of R.

Furthermore, there is no gainsaying the fact that as defendant No.1\n                                    himself proudly proclaims, he has a very large following on the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_318\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_319\">Digitally Signed By:ANJALI</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_320\">KAUSHIK</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_321\">Signing Date:01.07.2024      CS(OS) 300/2021                                                       Page 55 of 62</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_322\">14:43:08</span>\n                                     social-media platform Twitter and therefore whatever he says on that\n                                    platform has immense reach and therefore great impact. This imposes\n                                    upon defendant No.1 additional responsibility, in terms of what has\n                                    been held in <a href=\"/doc/31258577/\" id=\"a_25\">S.

The impact of the offending tweets and the fact that they evoked\n                                    derogatory and offensive responses is evident from a reading of the\n                                    comments received in response to the offending tweets, screenshots of\n                                    which have been placed by the plaintiff on record alongwith her\n                                    plaint, in support of which the plaintiff has also filed an affidavit. The\n                                    plaintiff has also filed a specific affidavit under <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_26\">section 65B</a> of the\n                                    Evidence Act in support of the response tweets/comments. Though\n                                    defendant No.1 has not „admitted‟ the comments received to the\n                                    offending tweets; and in his affidavit of admission/denial of\n                                    documents he disputes the comments stating that he &quot;... ...lacks any\n                                    personal knowledge thereof and the Defendant is not a party... ...&quot; to\n                                    those documents, such refutation cuts no ice since defendant No.1 has\n                                    chosen not to participate in the proceedings and has not cross-\n                                    examined the plaintiff on those comments.

Furthermore, as observed above, allegations of financial impropriety\n                                    dent the very foundations of a person‟s reputation. This is even more-\n                                    so if the person has occupied, or is closely associated with another\n                                    person who occupies, high public office. Allegations of financial\n                                    impropriety tend to „stick‟ and have the propensity to spread widely\n                                    through the „grapevine‟. Even rumor about financial improbity taints\n                                    a person‟s good name. In the present case, the false contents of the\n                                    offending tweets would, without a shred of doubt, have found their\n                                    way into the official ecosystem in which the plaintiff moves about,\n                                    and in which her husband functions.

Needless to add,\n                                    that the loss of esteem suffered by the plaintiff, even if based on utter\n                                    falsehood, would have resulted inevitably in loss of social standing,\n                                    accompanied by psychological distress, aggravated by the pain of\n                                    false accusation.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_347\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_348\">Digitally Signed By:ANJALI</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_349\">KAUSHIK</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_350\">Signing Date:01.07.2024      CS(OS) 300/2021                                                        Page 59 of 62</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_351\">14:43:08</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_141\">                              100. What makes it worse is that the pernicious and anarchic nature of\n                                    social-media, in this case Twitter, with its propensity to disseminate\n                                    content (including misinformation) widely and indiscriminately,\n                                    would certainly have resulted in very wide circulation of the\n                                    offending tweets. Defendant No.1 claims to be a popular RTI Activist\n                                    and is now also a Member of a political party. The offending tweets\n                                    have therefore no doubt been circulated in various political, official\n                                    and non-official circles. Defendant No.1‟s conduct after the offending\n                                    tweets were put-out, and after he was cautioned of the falsity of their\n                                    content, has been less than responsible or remorseful. Instead\n                                    defendant No.1 has chosen to persist in his stand. The indifference\n                                    displayed by defendant No. 1 in the course of the present proceedings,\n                                    is self-evident.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_142\">                             101. As a sequitur to the above, issue No. 1 is decided in favour of the\n                                    plaintiff and against defendant No.1.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_143\">                             102.

An\n                                    express, unreserved and unconditional apology is the very least that is\n                                    required from defendant No.1 for having put-out the offending tweets.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_145\">                             104.
