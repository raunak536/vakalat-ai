The principal issue raised is disposed of by  this  singular\norder. It is necessary to note that in Writ Petition (Criminal) No.  132  of\n2016 preferred by Asha Ranjan, it has been prayed for issue  of  appropriate\ndirections to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI)  to  take  over  the\ninvestigation in connection with  FIR  No.  362/16  dated  13.05.2016  under\nPolice Station Nagar Thana, Siwan, District Siwan  under  Sections  302/120B\nread with <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 34</a> of the Indian Penal Code (<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_2\">IPC</a>); to transfer the  entire\nproceedings and trial in FIR No. 362/16 dated  13.05.2016  registered  under\nthe same Police Station for the same offences from Siwan,  Bihar  to  Delhi;\nto call for the status report in  the  investigation  relating  to  FIR  No.\n362/16  dated  13.05.2016;  to  grant  appropriate   compensation   to   the\npetitioner and her family  members  and  to  ensure  their  security.   That\napart, there is also a prayer to register FIR against respondent Nos. 3  and\n4  for conspiracy  and harboring and sheltering the proclaimed offenders  in\nFIR No. 362/16 dated 13.05.2016. In this  Writ  Petition,  at  a  subsequent\nstage, Criminal Miscellaneous Petition No. 17101 of 2016 has been filed  for\ntransfer of respondent No. 3, M. Shahabuddin, from Siwan Jail,  Bihar  to  a\njail in Delhi.  During the pendency of this case, Writ  Petition  (Criminal)\nNo. 147 of 2016 came to be filed.  In the said Writ Petition, the prayer  is\nto issue a direction to transfer respondent No.  3,  M.  Shahabuddin,  to  a\njail outside the  State  of  Bihar  and  to  issue  further  directions  for\nconducting  of  the  trial  in  pending  cases  against  him  through  video\nconferencing.  Thus, the prayers in Writ  Petition  (Criminal)  No.  147  of\n2016 are two fold and in Writ  Petition  (Criminal)  No.  132  of  2016  are\nmanifold.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">2.    It is apposite to state here that both the cases, as  stated  earlier,\nwere heard together and learned counsel for the parties addressed the  Court\nwith regard to sustainability of prayer for transfer of  the  cases  pending\nagainst respondent No. 3,  Shahabuddin, from Siwan Jail to a jail  in  Delhi\nand conducting of the trial through video conferencing. As  far  as  lodging\nof FIR against respondent No. 4 in Writ Petition (Criminal) No. 132 of  2016\nis concerned, hearing on the said aspect was deferred which  is  clear  from\nthe order passed on January 17, 2017 in Writ Petition (Criminal) No. 132  of\n2016. We think it appropriate to reproduce the same:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">“In this writ petition, though the prayers have been couched in  a  manifold\nmanner,  there  are  basically  three  prayers,  namely,  the  transfer   of\nproceedings from Siwan, Bihar, to Delhi; secondly, to issue a  direction  to\nC.B.I. to investigate into certain crimes; and thirdly, to pass  appropriate\ndirection to register an F.I.R. against the respondent Nos.3 and 4.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">As far as the direction to C.B.I. for  taking  investigation  is  concerned,\nthis Court had already  issued  the  directions  and,  therefore,  the  said\nprayer does not any more survive.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">As far as the transfer of the proceedings is concerned which  is  associated\nwith the transfer of the accused, we are going to deal with the same in  the\ncriminal miscellaneous  petition  filed  in  this  writ  petition  and  Writ\nPetition (Crl.) No.147 of 2016.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">As far as the third prayer is concerned, it  is  seriously  opposed  by  Mr.\nSurendra Singh, learned senior  counsel  for  the  respondent  No.4  on  the\nground that there is no warrant or justification for lodging  of  an  F.I.R.\nand, in any case, no case is made out and what has been stated is solely  on\nthe basis of the photographs published in the  newspapers.  Be  that  as  it\nmay, as far as this prayer is concerned, it  shall  be  dealt  with  on  the\nanother date as we  have  reserved  the  order  regarding  transfer  of  the\nrespondent No.3 from Siwan Jail, Bihar to another jail, which is similar  to\nthe prayer in the Writ Petition (Crl.) No.147 of 2016.  The  judgment  shall\nbe delivered dealing with the said aspects and the  third  prayer  shall  be\nconsidered on another day, which shall be fixed at a later stage.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">3.    Thus, we are presently required to  deal  with  the  transfer  of  the\nthird respondent, M. Shahabuddin from the Siwan Jail, Bihar  to  a  Jail  in\nDelhi keeping in view the averments made in  Writ  Petition  (Criminal)  No.\n147 of 2016 and the  assertions  made  in  the  application  filed  in  Writ\nPetition  (Criminal) No. 132 of 2016\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">4.    The factual matrix in Writ Petition (Criminal) No.  132  of  2016,  as\nunfolded, is that on 13.5.2016  petitioner’s  husband,  namely,  Sh.  Rajdev\nRanjan,  Senior  Reporter  (Journalist  Incharge,  Dainik  Hindustan,  Siwan\nBureau, Bihar) was shot dead as he received  five  bullet  injuries  in  his\nhead and other parts of his body  and  FIR  No.  362/16  dated  13.5.16  was\nregistered under PS Nagar Thana, Dist. Siwan  for  the  offences  punishable\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_3\">Sections 302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/1128948/\" id=\"a_4\">120(B)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_5\">34</a> of IPC.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">5.    On 13.5.2016, the petitioner informed the police  that  one  notorious\ncriminal, Shahabuddin, and his henchmen were involved in the murder  of  her\nhusband but the police deliberately did not include the name of  Shahabuddin\nin the list of accused persons.   Thereafter, as the  matter  stands  today,\nthe investigation of the said case has been transferred to the CBI.   It  is\nasseverated that in the mean time certain persons  have  been  arrested  and\nsome have surrendered to custody.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">6.    The factual exposé of the murder of the husband of the petitioner  has\na narrative that goes back to the year 2005. The husband of the  petitioner,\na journalist, it is averred, had written various news reports pertaining  to\nserious and substantive criminal activities  of  said  Shahabuddin  who  had\nthreatened to eliminate him and his family members. Undeterred  he  kept  on\nwriting various investigative  news  articles  and  reports  in  respect  of\nmurder of the three sons of one Siwan resident, namely, Chanda  Babu,  which\neventually led to the arrest of Shahabuddin  and  after  conclusion  of  the\ntrial he  stood  convicted  for  the  offence  under  <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_6\">Section  302</a>  IPC  and\nsentenced to undergo life imprisonment. It is apt to note  that  during  the\ntrial of  the  said  case,  Shahabuddin  and  his  shooters  had  constantly\nthreatened the petitioner’s husband  with  death  threats  to  him  and  the\nfamily members.  As the narration has been  undraped,  petitioner’s  husband\nhighlighted about the murder of  one  Shrikant  Bharti  by  publishing  news\narticles and at that stage on 13.5.2016 petitioner’s  husband  got  a  phone\ncall from an unknown person on his mobile              about 7.15  p.m.  and\nsoon thereafter he left the office and started moving  towards  the  Station\nRoad.  About 7.30 p.m. he was shot dead and the ephemeral  threat  became  a\nreality.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">7.    Thereafter, during the course of investigation, two  accused  persons,\nnamely, Mohammed  Kaif  and  Mohammad  Javed  were  declared  as  proclaimed\noffenders. On 10.9.2016, Shahabuddin was released on bail and the  aforesaid\nproclaimed offenders were seen in his company but  apathy  reigned  and  the\nfear ruled so that no police official dared to arrest  them.   On  14.9.2016\npetitioner saw the pictures of the proclaimed offenders  Mohammed  Kaif  and\nMohammad Javed with Shri Tej Pratap Yadav, Health Minister of Bihar  on  all\nmedia channels.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">8.    Feeling insecured, terrorized and helpless as regards her  safety  and\nsecurity and of her two  minor  children,  the  petitioner  has  moved  this\nCourt. As set forth, the death of the husband, makes her  apprehensive  that\nShahabuddin may eliminate her entire  family.  Her  petrification  has  been\nagonizingly  articulated  in  the  petition  and  by  the  learned  counsel,\nsometimes with vehemence and on occasions with desperation.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_10\">9.    At this juncture, we may advert to the facts in Writ  Petition  (Crl.)\nNo. 147 of 2016.  It is averred that respondent No. 3 is a dreaded criminal-\ncum-politician who has already been declared history-sheeter Type A (who  is\nbeyond reform) and till date he has been booked in 75 cases out of which  in\n10 cases he has been convicted, and facing life imprisonment  in  two  cases\nand 10 years rigorous imprisonment in one  and  45  cases  are  pending  for\ntrial.  He has been acquitted in twenty  cases.   The  first  criminal  case\nagainst respondent No. 3 was initiated  in  1986.  The  criminal  activities\ncontinued in  some  form  or  other  and  on  3.5.1996  he  along  with  his\nassociates fired upon the then Superintendent of Police, Shri S.K.  Singhal,\nIPS with sophisticated  arms  for  which  they  were  sentenced  to  undergo\nimprisonment for 10 years.   Thereafter, his name figured in the  murder  of\nformer JNU President, Mr. Chandrashekhar, who was  shot  dead  in  Siwan  on\n31.3.1997.  It is alleged that he  and  his  private  army  fired  upon  the\nraiding party on 16.3.2002 when his house was raided and in  that  incident,\nthe vehicles of Deputy Inspector General of Police,  Saran  range,  District\nMagistrate, Siwan and Superintendent of Police, Siwan were burnt.  From  his\nhouse, huge quantities of ammunition were recovered and FIR no. 32  of  2001\nwas registered.  In another raid conducted in 2005,  large  number  of  arms\nand ammunition were recovered from the house of  the  third  respondent  and\nFIR Nos. 41 to 44 of  2005  were  registered.   In  November,  2005  he  was\narrested by the joint team of Bihar and  Delhi  police  in  connection  with\nvarious cases.  It is put forth that he ran  a  parallel  administration  in\nSiwan from 1990 till 2005 and in March, 2007 he was sentenced to  two  years\nimprisonment for assault on CPI-ML  offices  in  Siwan  on  19th  September,\n1998. Further he was sentenced to  life  imprisonment  on  08.05.2007  under\n<a href=\"/doc/695990/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 364</a>/<a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_8\">34</a> IPC for abduction with an intention to commit murder  of  CPI\n(ML) worker in February, 1999, whose dead body was never traced.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_11\">10.   It is set forth that in August 2004,  three  sons  of  the  petitioner\nwere picked up by the henchmen of respondent No. 3 and taken to  his  native\nvillage Pratappur where two of his sons,  namely,  Girish  and  Satish  were\ndrenched in acid and his third son, who  witnessed  the  murder  managed  to\nescape and a criminal case was registered against him  under  <a href=\"/doc/1599401/\" id=\"a_9\">Sections  341</a>,\n<a href=\"/doc/1011035/\" id=\"a_10\">323</a>, <a href=\"/doc/839778/\" id=\"a_11\">380</a>, <a href=\"/doc/695990/\" id=\"a_12\">364</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1552733/\" id=\"a_13\">435</a>/<a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_14\">34</a> IPC for abduction, etc. of the petitioner’s  two  sons\nin which charges were framed on 04.06.2010  against  respondent  No.  3  and\nothers.  The prosecution moved an application for addition of charges  under\n<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_15\">Sections 302</a> and <a href=\"/doc/386021/\" id=\"a_16\">201</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 120B</a> IPC, which prayer was  initially\nrejected on the ground of delay but after the direction of  the  High  Court\nof Patna, the charges under the aforesaid Sections  were  added  vide  order\ndated 18.04.2014.   During  the  litigation,  the  petitioner’s  third  son,\nRajeev Roshan, a material eye witness in the said case was murdered  and  an\nFIR No. 220/14 was lodged against respondent No. 3, his son Osama and  other\nunknown persons.  Thus, the three sons of the petitioner were murdered.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_12\">11.   On 18.05.2016, a raid was conducted by the district administration  at\nSiwan jail and District Magistrate, Siwan in his  report  stated  about  the\nconduct of respondent No. 3 inside  the  jail  and  the  facilities  he  was\nenjoying in jail in violation of the jail rules/manual and  recommended  his\ntransfer from Siwan to Bhagalpur  jail  whereafter  he  was  transferred  to\nBhagalpur jail for six months.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"91226601\" id=\"span_1\">12.   As the narration would further unfurl, in  the  said  case,  the  High\nCourt granted bail to the respondent No. 3 on 02.03.2016 in FIR  No.  131/04\nand further granted bail in the murder’s case of third son of petitioner  on\n07.09.2016 in the FIR No. 220/14. The petitioner as well  as  the  State  of\nBihar challenged the orders granting bail. The bail  orders  have  been  set\naside by this Court in <a href=\"/doc/91226601/\" id=\"a_18\">Chandrakeshwar Prasad v. State of Bihar and  Anr.</a>[1].\nWhile setting aside the order granting him bail, this Court has held:-</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"91226601\" id=\"span_2\">“12. In the instant case, having regard to the recorded allegations  against\nthe respondent-accused and the overall  factual  scenario,  we  are  of  the\nview, having regard in particular to the present stage of the case in  which\nthe impugned order has been passed, that the High Court  was  not  justified\nin granting bail on the considerations recorded. Qua the assertion that  the\nrespondent-accused was  in  judicial  custody  on  the  date  on  which  the\nincident of murder in the earlier case had occurred, the judgment and  order\nof the trial court convicting him has recorded the version  of  the  brother\nof  the  deceased  therein,  that  he  had   seen   the   respondent-accused\nparticipating in the offence. We refrain from elaborating  further  on  this\naspect as <a href=\"/doc/91226601/\" id=\"a_19\">the said judgment</a> and order of the trial court  is  presently  sub\njudice in an appeal before the High Court.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">13. On a careful perusal of the records of the case and considering all  the\naspects of the matter in question and having regard to  the  proved  charges\nin the cases concerned, and the charges  pending  adjudication  against  the\nrespondent-accused and further balancing the  considerations  of  individual\nliberty  and  societal  interest  as  well  as  the  prescriptions  and  the\nperception of law regarding bail, it appears to us that the High  Court  has\nerred in  granting  bail  to  the  respondent-accused  without  taking  into\nconsideration the overall facts otherwise having a bearing on  the  exercise\nof its discretion on the issue.”\n\n      On the  aforementioned  factual  plinth,  the  petitioner  has  sought\ntransfer of the third respondent from the Siwan jail to a jail  outside  the\nState of Bihar and conducting of  the  trials  in  pending  cases  by  video\nconferencing.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">13.   We have heard Mr. Shanti  Bhushan  and   Mr.  Dushyant  Dave,  learned\nsenior counsel and Mr. Kislay Pandey, learned  counsel for the  petitioners,\n Mr. P.S.   Narasimha, learned Additional Solicitor  General  and  Mr.  P.K.\nDey, learned counsel  appearing  for  CBI,   Mr.  Shekhar  Naphade,  learned\nsenior counsel along with Mr. M. Shoeb Alam, learned counsel for  respondent\nNo.  3,   Mr.  Surendra  Singh,  learned  senior  counsel  along  with   Mr.\nDhirendra Singh Parmar,  learned  counsel  for  respondent  No.  4  in  Writ\nPetition (Criminal) No. 132 of 2016 and Mr.  Gopal  Singh,  learned  counsel\nfor the State of Bihar.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">14.   As per our order dated  17.01.2017,  the  grievance  against  the  4th\nrespondent in Writ Petition (Criminal) No. 132 of 2016 shall  be  heard  and\ndealt with after pronouncement of this judgment  and  hence,  we  shall  not\ndelve into the contentions put forth in  the  said  writ  petition  and  the\nstand taken in the counter affidavit in that regard for the present.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">15.   The seminal issue that we are required  to  address  is  whether  this\nCourt, in exercise of  power  under  <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_20\">Article  32</a>  and  <a href=\"/doc/500307/\" id=\"a_21\">Article  142</a>  of  the\nConstitution can direct transfer of an accused from  one  State  to  another\nand direct conducting of  pending  trials  by  way  of  video  conferencing.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">Needless to emphasise the said advertence in law will also depend  upon  the\nfactual scenario and satisfaction of the judicial conscience of  this  Court\nto take recourse to such a mode. The petitioners have asserted  with  regard\nto the criminal activities of the third respondent, the cases  in  which  he\nhas been roped in, the convictions he has faced, the sentences imposed  upon\nhim, the snails speed at which the trials are in  progress  because  of  the\nterror that reigns in Siwan, the declaration of the third  respondent  as  a\nhistory-sheeter            Type-A (who is beyond  reform),  the  non-chalant\nattitude unabashedly and brazenly demonstrated by him that has unnerved  and\nshaken the victims and the society at large, the  impunity  with  which  the\ncollusion  with  the  jail  administration  has  taken  place,  the  blatant\nintimidation of witnesses that weakens their sense  of  truth  and  justice;\nand  mortal  terror  unleashed  when  they  come  to  court,  the  audacious\nviolation of the rules and regulations  that  are  supposed  to  govern  the\nconvicts or under-trial prisoners inside the jail as if they have been  made\nelegantly unperceivable and the confinement inside jail remains  a  word  on\npaper, for the third respondent, still is able  to  issue  his  command  and\nwrits from the jail, run a parallel administration  and  get  involved  with\nthe crimes, at his own whim and fancy. The stand and  stance  put  forth  in\nthe petitions and the arguments advanced  by  Mr.  Shanti  Bhushan  and  Mr.\nDushyant Dave, sometimes one may be inclined to think, are in the  realm  of\nrhetorics but the learned senior counsel for the petitioners and Mr.  Kislay\nPandey, submitted with enormous agony, and filed a chart  to  bolster  their\nstand and submission.  The Court had also asked Mr. P.S. Narasimha, and  Mr.\nP.K. Dey, learned counsel appearing for the CBI  to  submit  a  chart.   The\nchart showing  the  cases  where  either  the  respondent  No.  3  has  been\nconvicted or acquitted  or  cases  pending  against  him,  has  been  filed.\nWithout commenting on the merits, we think it apt to reproduce the Chart:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">                              “CONVICTION CASES\n\n\n|Sl. |FIR P.S.   |Under Section  |Status of   |Stat|Date of|Period  |\n|No  |case No    |               |Trial       |us  |Grant  |of      |\n|    |           |               |conviction  |of  |of bail|Imprison|\n|    |           |               |(with       |appe|by     |ment    |\n|    |           |               |sentence)/  |al  |Distric|before  |\n|    |           |               |Pending/Acqu|    |t/High |grant of|\n|    |           |               |ittal (in   |    |Court  |bail    |\n|    |           |               |series)     |    |       |        |\n|1   |Muffasil PS|147/341/342/448|2 Year      |-   |Bail   |0 days  |\n|    |Case No.   |/504 <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_22\">IPC</a>       |imprisonment|    |28.10.0|        |\n|    |181/98 dt  |               |&amp; 5000/-    |    |9 by HC|        |\n|    |18.09.98   |               |fine        |    |Patna  |        |\n|2   |C-2 34/05  |506 <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_23\">IPC</a>        |1 year      |-   |Bail   |3 yrs, 8|\n|    |Dt.        |               |imprisonment|    |28.10.0|months, |\n|    |07.04.05   |               |and Rs.1000 |    |9 by   |8 days  |\n|    |           |               |fine        |    |Spl.   |        |\n|    |           |               |            |    |Court  |        |\n|3   |Muffasil PS|363/365 <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_24\">IPC</a>    |3 year      |-   |Bail   |0 Days  |\n|    |case       |               |imprisonment|    |11.03.1|        |\n|    |61/90 Dt.  |               |            |    |1      |        |\n|    |12.04.90   |               |            |    |By Spl.|        |\n|    |           |               |            |    |Court  |        |\n|    |           |               |            |    |Siwan  |        |\n|4   |Hussainganj|364/34 <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_25\">IPC</a>     |Life &amp;      |-   |Bail   |3 yrs 3 |\n|    |ps case    |               |Rs.10,000/- |    |21.10.9|mon     |\n|    |No.14/99   |               |            |    |9 by HC|        |\n|    |dt. 07.2.99|               |            |    |Patna  |        |\n|5   |Darauli ps |307/353/34 <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_26\">IPC</a>|10 years &amp;  |    |Bail   |2 yrs 1 |\n|    |C.No. 34/96|              |Rs. 2000/-  |    |21.10.0|mon 21  |\n|    |dt:        |              |            |    |9 by HC|days    |\n|    |04.05.96   |              |            |    |Patna  |        |\n|6   |Hussainganj|25I-B) A/26/35|3 Yrs       |-   |Bail   |2 yrs 9 |\n|    |ps         |<a href=\"/doc/1934415/\" id=\"a_27\">Arms Act</a>      |imprisonment|    |20.10.0|mon 10  |\n|    |Case       |              |&amp; 5000/-    |    |9 by HC|days    |\n|    |no.44/05   |              |fine        |    |Patna  |        |\n|    |Dt.        |              |            |    |       |        |\n|    |24.04.05   |              |            |    |       |        |\n|7   |Hussainganj|414 <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_28\">IPC</a> &amp; 25  |5 years     |    |Bail   |5 yrs 8 |\n|    |ps         |(I-B)/26 Arms |imprisonment|    |16.07.1|mon 9   |\n|    |Case no.   |Act           |            |    |1      |days    |\n|    |42/05      |              |            |    |       |        |\n|    |Dt:24.04.05|              |            |    |       |        |\n|8   |Muffasil ps|364/336/302/30|Life        |    |Bail   |6 yrs 10|\n|    |Case no.   |1 <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_29\">IPC</a>         |imprisonment|    |14.07.1|months 5|\n|    |131/04     |              |            |    |6 by HC|days    |\n|    |Dt:        |              |            |    |Patna  |        |\n|    |16.08.04   |              |            |    |       |        |\n|9   |Hussainganj|411/414 <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_30\">IPC</a>   |3 yrs       |-   |Bail   |3 yrs 11|\n|    |ps         |              |imprisonment|    |28.10.0|months  |\n|    |Case       |              |            |    |9 by HC|21 days |\n|    |no.41/05   |              |            |    |Patna  |        |\n|    |Dt:        |              |            |    |       |        |\n|    |24.04.05   |              |            |    |       |        |\n|10  |Pachruhi ps|392/411 <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_31\">IPC</a>   |This case is|    |-do-   |        |\n|    |Case no.   |              |merged in   |    |       |        |\n|    |102/04     |              |Hussainganj |    |       |        |\n|    |Dt.        |              |ps case no. |    |       |        |\n|    |18.10.04   |              |41/05       |    |       |        |\n\n                               ACQUITTED CASES\n|Sl.

On a perusal of the aforesaid chart, it is  clear  as  noon  day  that\nrespondent No. 3 has been involved in  numerous  cases;  that  he  has  been\nbooked in at least 75 cases, out of which he stands convicted in  10  cases;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_15\">that he is facing life imprisonment in two, which  include  murder  case  of\nthe Petitioner’s two sons, and 10 years rigorous imprisonment in  one;  that\nout of 45 pending cases, at least 21 are those where maximum sentence  is  7\nyears and more, including 9 for murder and 4 for  attempt  to  murder;  that\napart from the murder of the Petitioner’s two sons, there are  at  least  15\nout of total 45 pending cases which have been registered against  him  while\nhe was in jail and out of these 15 pending cases, one is for the  murder  of\nthe Petitioner’s third son and two are for attempt to murder.  He  has  been\ndeclared a history-sheeter Type ‘A’ (who is beyond reform).\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_16\">17.   Referring to the chart, it is urged  with  vehemence  by  Mr.  Bhushan\nthat the third respondent is a criminal of such nature who is beyond  reform\nand his influence is writ large in the State of Bihar.  It is  contended  by\nhim that the said respondent has been a Member of Legislative  Assembly  for\ntwo times and Member of Parliament from Siwan on four occasions.  In such  a\nsituation, contend Mr. Bhushan and Mr. Dave,  it  is  absolutely  difficult,\nnay, impossible to get justice  because  utmost  fear  prevails  and  nerve-\nwrecking terror reigns supreme in the  locality.   In  such  an  atmosphere,\njustice will be the first  casualty  and,  therefore,  this  Court,  as  the\nprotector of the constitutional rights, should direct transfer of the  third\nrespondent to a jail outside Bihar  wherever  trial  by  video  conferencing\nwould be possible.  Mr. Bhushan,   in  the  course  of  his  arguments,  has\ncommended us to  certain  authorities,  which  we  shall  refer  to  at  the\nrelevant stage.  Mr. Gopal Singh, learned counsel for  the  State  of  Bihar\nsubmitted that the State of  Bihar  is  wedded  to  rule  of  law  and  will\nreligiously endeavour to carry out the directions of  this  Court  that  the\nCourt may ultimately direct, regard being had to the concept of fair  trial.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_17\">18.    Mr.  Naphade,  learned  senior  counsel  appearing  for   the   third\nrespondent, would contend that for the purpose of  transferring  an  accused\nfrom the State of Bihar to a prison outside the State  there  must  exist  a\nlaw on the statute book which permits such transfer.  In the absence of  any\nlaw, it is not permissible in law to issue any direction for such  transfer.\n According to Mr. Naphade, by transfer to a prison outside  the  State,  the\nrights of an under-trial prisoner under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_124\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_125\">21</a> are violated  and\nwhen the third respondent is facing trial in 45 cases, his  transfer  should\nnot be so directed.  Learned senior counsel would urge that if an action  of\na State is prejudicial to the right of an individual, it has  to  be  backed\nby an authority of law and in the absence of the same,  such  an  action  is\ninconceivable. It is further propounded by Mr.  Naphade  that  an  order  of\ntransfer cannot be passed in exercise of power  under  <a href=\"/doc/500307/\" id=\"a_126\">Article  142</a>  of  the\nConstitution, as it will be inconsistent with the substantive provisions  of\nthe relevant statutory law.  It is canvassed  by  Mr.  Naphade  that  powers\nexercisable under <a href=\"/doc/500307/\" id=\"a_127\">Article 142</a> is to  do  complete  justice,  but  it  cannot\nassume a legislative character,  for  legislation  is  absolutely  different\nthan adjudication. It is his further submission that <a href=\"/doc/500307/\" id=\"a_128\">Article  142</a>  does  not\nempower this Court to enact law and transferring the third  respondent  from\nBihar to any other prison outside  the  State  would  amount  to  the  Court\nenacting the law and then exercising the judicial power to enforce the  law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_18\">19.   Learned senior counsel would put forth  that  transferring  the  third\nrespondent from his home State to  another  State  would  affect  his  right\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_129\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution and such an order is only  possible  in\naccordance with the procedure established by law and in the absence  of  any\nlaw, the submission advanced on behalf  of  the  petitioners  is  absolutely\nuntenable.  Criticising the rhetorical arguments assiduously  structured  by\nthe learned senior counsel for the petitioners, it is astutely expounded  by\nMr. Naphade that the argument is fundamentally founded on  equity  which  is\ngiven  the  colour  of  justice  and  fairness  in  trial,  nullifying   the\nfundamental principle that equity has to yield to the statutory  provisions.\n Further, the third respondent, as an accused,  has  a  right  to  be  tried\nfairly under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_130\">Article 21</a> and his right cannot be scuttled or corroded at  the\ninstance of the petitioners.  Learned senior counsel would urge  that  in  a\ncase of the present nature, the question of balancing  of  rights  does  not\narise,  for  the  principle  of  balancing  of  rights  applies  where   two\nfundamental rights compete but here it is the right of the third  respondent\nwhich has to be protected under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_131\">Article 21</a> which has been given  the  highly\ncherished value by this Court, and the Court is the sole  protector  of  the\nsaid right.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_19\">20.   First, we shall have a survey of the statutory law in the field.   <a href=\"/doc/52066971/\" id=\"a_132\">The\nPrisoners Act, 1900</a> was  brought  into  existence  to  consolidate  the  law\nrelating to prisoners confined by the order of a court.   As <a href=\"/doc/56923049/\" id=\"a_133\">Section  29</a>  of\nthe Prisoners Act, 1900 covered a different field,  the  Parliament  thought\nit appropriate to bring in the <a href=\"/doc/1264536/\" id=\"a_134\">Transfer of Prisoners Act, 1950</a>  (for  short,\n“the 1950 Act”).  It is necessary to state what compelled the Parliament  to\nbring the said legislation.  The Statement of Objects  and  Reasons  of  the\n1950 Act states as follows:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">“<a href=\"/doc/56923049/\" id=\"a_135\">Section 29</a> of the Prisoners Act, 1900, inter alia, provided for the  inter-\nState transfer of prisoners between the States in Parts A, C and  D  of  the\nFirst Schedule to  the  Constitution.   There  was  no  provision,  however,\neither in the <a href=\"/doc/52066971/\" id=\"a_136\">Prisoners Act, 1900</a> or any  other  law  for  the  transfer  of\nprisoners in those States to prisons  in  Part  B  States  and  vice  versa.\nCases may arise where the removal for the transfer of prisoners  from  Parts\nA, C and D States to  Part  B  States  and  vice  versa  may  be  considered\nadministratively desirable or necessary”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_20\">21.   <a href=\"/doc/1092263/\" id=\"a_137\">Section 3</a> of the 1950 Act reads as follows:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">“3.

We are required to examine, when the said provision  permits  transfer\noutside the State only in certain circumstances and the case  of  respondent\nNo. 3 does not come within any  of  the  circumstances,  could  the  accused\nrespondent be transferred from the prison  in  Bihar  to  any  other  prison\nsituate in another State.  It is also necessary  to  be  addressed,  whether\nthe  transfer  would  vitiate  the  basic  tenet  of  <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_138\">Article  21</a>   of   the\nConstitution and should such  a  right  be  allowed  to  founder.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"117760733\" id=\"span_3\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"162242\" id=\"span_4\">In  this\nregard,  we  have  been   commended   to   <a href=\"/doc/162242/\" id=\"a_139\">Sunil   Batra   (II)   v.

The  said  passage\nreads thus:-</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">“The mood and temper of the public in regard to the treatment of  crime  and\ncriminals is one of the most unfailing tests  of  the  civilization  of  any\ncountry. A calm dispassionate recognition of the rights of the accused,  and\neven of the convicted criminal,  against  the  State  —  a  constant  heart-\nsearching by all charged  with  the  duty  of  punishment  —  a  desire  and\neagerness to rehabilitate in the world  of  industry  those  who  have  paid\ntheir due in the hard coinage of punishment: tireless  efforts  towards  the\ndiscovery of curative  and  regenerative  processes:  unfailing  faith  that\nthere is a treasure, if you can only find it, in the  heart  of  every  man.\nThese are the symbols, which, in the treatment of crime and  criminal,  mark\nand measure the stored-up strength of a nation, and are sign  and  proof  of\nthe living virtue in it.”\n\n      We may  immediately  say,  we  share  the  same  thought  without  any\nreservation.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_25\">24.   The Court observed that it was the import of the Preamble and  <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_146\">Article\n21</a> of the Constitution that  the  protection  of  the  prisoner  would  come\nwithin the rights that is needed protection under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_147\">Article  32.</a>   The  three-\nJudge Bench referred to the facts and thereafter adverting to the rights  of\nthe prisoners opined thus:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">“40. Prisoners are peculiarly and doubly handicapped. For  one  thing,  most\nprisoners belong  to  the  weaker  segment,  in  poverty,  literacy,  social\nstation and the like. Secondly, the  prison  house  is  a  walled-off  world\nwhich is incommunicado for the human world, with the result that the  bonded\ninmates are invisible, their voices inaudible,  their  injustices  unheeded.\nSo it is imperative, as implicit in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_148\">Article 21</a>, that life or liberty,  shall\nnot be kept in  suspended  animation  or  congealed  into  animal  existence\nwithout the freshening flow of fair procedure. The meaning of  ‘life’  given\nby Field, J.,  approved  in  Kharak  Singh[5]  and  Maneka  Gandhi[6]  bears\nexcerption:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">“Something more than mere  animal  existence.  The  inhibition  against  its\ndeprivation extends to all those  limbs  and  faculties  by  which  life  is\nenjoyed. The provision equally prohibits the mutilation of the body  by  the\namputation of an arm  or  leg,  or  the  putting  out  of  an  eye,  or  the\ndestruction  of  any  other  organ  of  the  body  through  which  the  soul\ncommunicates with the outer world.”\n\nTherefore, inside prisons are persons and their personhood, if  crippled  by\nlaw-keepers turning law-breakers, shall be forbidden by  the  writ  of  this\nCourt from such wrongdoing.  Fair  procedure,  in  dealing  with  prisoners,\ntherefore, calls for another dimension of access  to  law-provision,  within\neasy reach, of the law which limits liberty to  persons  who  are  prevented\nfrom moving out of prison gates.”\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"353351\" id=\"span_8\">25.   The learned  Judges  affirmed  the  position,  as  had  been  held  by\nChandrachud, J., (as His Lordship then was) in <a href=\"/doc/353351/\" id=\"a_149\">D.  Bhuvan  Mohan  Patnaik  &amp;\nOrs v. State of A.P. &amp; Ors</a>[7]:-</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">“Convicts are not, by mere reason of the  conviction,  denuded  of  all  the\nfundamental rights which they otherwise  possess.  A  compulsion  under  the\nauthority of law, following upon a conviction, to  live  in  a  prison-house\nentails by its own force the deprivation of fundamental  freedoms  like  the\nright to move freely throughout the territory  of  India  or  the  right  to\n‘practise’ a profession. A man of profession would thus  stand  stripped  of\nhis right to hold consultations while serving  out  his  sentence.  But  the\nConstitution guarantees other freedoms like the right to acquire,  hold  and\ndispose of property for the  exercise  of  which  incarceration  can  be  no\nimpediment. Likewise, even a convict  is  entitled  to  the  precious  right\nguaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_150\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution that he shall not  be  deprived\nof his life or personal liberty except according  to  procedure  established\nby law.”\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">26.   Eventually, they laid down:-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">“48. Inflictions may take many protean forms, apart from physical  assaults.\nPushing the prisoner into a solitary cell, denial of  a  necessary  amenity,\nand, more dreadful sometimes, transfer to a distant prison where  visits  or\nsociety of friends or relations  may  be  snapped,  allotment  of  degrading\nlabour, assigning him to a desperate or tough gang  and  the  like,  may  be\npunitive in effect. Every such affliction or abridgment is an infraction  of\nliberty or life in its wider sense and cannot be  sustained  unless  <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_151\">Article\n21</a> is satisfied. There must  be  a  corrective  legal  procedure,  fair  and\nreasonable and effective. Such infraction will be arbitrary,  under  <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_152\">Article\n14</a> if it is dependent on unguided discretion,  unreasonable,  under  <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_153\">Article\n19</a> if it is irremediable and unappealable, and unfair, under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_154\">Article  21</a>  if\nit violates natural justice. The string of guidelines in Batra1 set  out  in\nthe first judgment, which we adopt, provides for a hearing at  some  stages,\na review by a  superior,  and  early  judicial  consideration  so  that  the\nproceedings may not hop from Caesar to Caesar. We direct  strict  compliance\nwith those norms and institutional provisions for that purpose.”\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"117760733\" id=\"span_9\">27.   Considerable emphasis was laid  on  the  aspect  that  transfer  to  a\ndistant prison where visits or society of friends or relations  is  snapped,\nis an affliction or abridgment and the same is an infraction of  liberty  or\nlife in its wider sense  and  cannot  be  sustained  unless  <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_155\">Article  21</a>  is\nsatisfied. This would be a relevant aspect as held  in  <a href=\"/doc/117760733/\" id=\"a_156\">Saeed  Sohail  Sheik</a>\n(supra).  In the said  case,  the  Court  referred  to  <a href=\"/doc/56923049/\" id=\"a_157\">Section  29</a>  of  the\nPrisoners Act, 1900. Interpreting the said provision the Court held:-</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">“20. Reliance upon  sub-section  (2)  of  <a href=\"/doc/1570966/\" id=\"a_158\">Section  29</a>,  in  support  of  the\ncontention that the transfer of an undertrial is permissible, is also of  no\nassistance to the appellants  in  our  opinion.  Sub-section  (2)  no  doubt\nempowers the Inspector General of Prisons to direct a transfer but  what  is\nimportant is that any such transfer is of a  prisoner  who  is  confined  in\ncircumstances mentioned in sub-section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/1570966/\" id=\"a_159\">Section 29</a>.  That  is  evident\nfrom the use of words “any prisoner confined as aforesaid in a prison”.  The\nexpression leaves no manner of doubt that a transfer under  sub-section  (2)\nis also permissible only if it relates to prisoners  who  were  confined  in\ncircumstances indicated in sub-section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/1570966/\" id=\"a_160\">Section  29</a>.  The  respondents\nin the present case were undertrials who could not have been transferred  in\nterms of the orders of the Inspector General of  Prisons  under  <a href=\"/doc/1570966/\" id=\"a_161\">Section  29</a>\nextracted above.”\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">28.   Thereafter, the Court referred to <a href=\"/doc/1501582/\" id=\"a_162\">Section 26</a> of the Prisons Act,  1894\nand <a href=\"/doc/1687975/\" id=\"a_163\">Sections 167</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1645292/\" id=\"a_164\">309</a> of the CrPC and adverted to  the  nature  of  power\nexercisable by the Court while permitting  or  refusing  the  transfer.   In\nthat context it ruled:-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">“25.  ……We  have,  however,  no  hesitation  in  holding  that   the   power\nexercisable  by  the  court  while  permitting  or  refusing   transfer   is\n“judicial” and not “ministerial” as contended by  Mr  Naphade.  Exercise  of\nministerial power is out of place in situations where  quality  of  life  or\nthe liberty of a citizen is affected, no matter he/she is under  a  sentence\nof imprisonment or is facing a criminal charge in  an  ongoing  trial.  That\ntransfer of an undertrial to a  distant  prison  may  adversely  affect  his\nright to defend himself but  also  isolate  him  from  the  society  of  his\nfriends and relations is settled by the decision  of  this  Court  in  Sunil\nBatra (2) v. Delhi Admn.”\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">29.   In the ultimate analysis, the Court arrived  at  the  conclusion  that\nany order that the Court may make on a request for transfer  of  a  prisoner\nis bound to affect him prejudicially, and, therefore, it is  obligatory  for\nthe court to apply its mind fairly and objectively to the  circumstances  in\nwhich the transfer is being prayed for and take  a  considered  view  having\nregard to the objections which the prisoner may have to offer. There  is  in\nthat process of determination and decision-making an implicit  duty  to  act\nfairly, objectively or in other words, to act judicially.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">30.   The aforesaid two pronouncements have been  pressed  into  service  to\nbuttress the stand that transfer of prisoner to  a  distant  place  violates\ninherent constituent of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_165\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. It is also  proponed\nthat if the transfer is directed, it  would  affect  the  edifice  of  “fair\ntrial” to which an accused is entitled to within the ambit and sweep of  the\nsaid Article.  The aforesaid two limbs of submission founded  on  the  basic\nprinciple  of  right  to  life  require  to  be  appositely  understood  and\nappreciated. The first plank of submission in  this  regard  that  has  been\nstructured with phenomenal perceptiveness is that an  order  transferring  a\nprisoner, a convict or under  trial  to  a  distance  prison  is  absolutely\nunacceptable and, if such an order is passed, it would clearly  violate  the\nfundamental right of the accused which  has  been  conferred  on  him  under\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_166\">Article 21</a> in its expanded horizon. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"162242\" id=\"span_10\">In <a href=\"/doc/162242/\" id=\"a_167\">Sunil Batra  (II</a>)  (supra),  we  find\nthat the transfer from one prison to another was not the  real  controversy.</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"162242\" id=\"span_11\">The controversy pertained to a different  factual  score.  The  observations\nmade in para 49 of  <a href=\"/doc/162242/\" id=\"a_168\">the  said  judgment</a>  really  pertain  to  protection  of\nprisoners in the jail.  By taking  recourse  to  the  epistolary  method  of\nentertaining a petition under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_169\">Article 32</a>  of  the  Constitution,  the  Court\nexpressed its concern about the ill treatment and torture  to  prisoners  in\nthe jail and reflected on prison reforms.   It is worthy to note  that  that\nthe Court has really stated that transfer in certain cases may  be  punitive\nin effect and such actions may tantamount to affliction on liberty  or  life\nin  the  wider  sense.  Simultaneously,  the  Court  has  ruled  that   such\naffliction  or  abridgement  cannot  be  sustained  unless  <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_170\">Article  21</a>   is\nsatisfied and there has to be a correct legal procedure, and  the  procedure\nto be adopted has to be fair and reasonable, and the discretion  should  not\nbe exercised in an unguided or unreasonable  manner.    Thus,  the  decision\nitself does not lay down the principle in absolute  terms.</span>   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"117760733\" id=\"span_12\">Similarly,  the\nauthority in <a href=\"/doc/117760733/\" id=\"a_171\">Saeed Sohail Sheik</a>  (supra) was  dealing  with  transfer  of  a\nprisoner and focused  on  the  nature  of  power  exercised  by  the  Court.</span>\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"162242\" id=\"span_13\"><a href=\"/doc/162242/\" id=\"a_172\">Reference to Sunil Batra (II</a>) (supra) was made to bolster that an  order  of\ntransfer from one prison to another is not a  ministerial  act.   Thus,  the\nsaid authority is not a  precedent  for  the  proposition  that  an  accused\ncannot be transferred to a prison at a distant  place,  when  justice,  fair\nand free trial so requires.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_27\">31.   This aspect of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_173\">Article 21</a>, it is imperative, has to be tested  on  the\nbedrock of fair trial.  The question that is required to be posed is if  the\naccused is transferred to another jail in  another  State,  would  the  same\nbecome an apology for trial or promote and safeguard free  and  fair  trial.\nThe argument that all relevant witnesses are in Siwan and the witnesses  the\ndefence intends to cite are in Siwan and  in  such  a  situation  the  trial\nafter shifting cannot be characterized as fair  trial  refers  to  only  one\naspect. The concept of fair trial recognized  under  the  <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_174\">Code  of  Criminal\nProcedure</a> is conferred an elevated status under the Constitution, is a  much\nbroader and wider concept.  If the transfer will create a dent in  the  said\nconcept, there is no justification to accept such a prayer at the behest  of\nthe petitioners.  In oppugnation, the conception of fair trial  in  criminal\njurisprudence is not one way traffic,  but  includes  the  accused  and  the\nvictim and it is the duty of the court to weigh the balance. When  there  is\nthreat to life, liberty and fear pervades, it sends  shivers  in  the  spine\nand corrodes the basic marrows of holding of the trial  at  Siwan.  This  is\nquite farther from the idea of fair trial. The  grievance  of  the  victims,\nwho have enormously and apparently suffered deserves to  be  dealt  with  as\nper the law of the land and should not remain a mirage and a distant  dream.\nAs we find, both sides have propounded the propositions  in  extreme  terms.\nAnd we have a duty to balance.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_28\">32.   To appreciate the contention on this score, we may, at present,  refer\nto  certain  authorities  that  have  dealt   with   fair   trial   in   the\nconstitutional and statutory backdrop.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_29\">33.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"7476014\" id=\"span_14\">In <a href=\"/doc/7476014/\" id=\"a_175\">J. Jayalalithaa &amp; Ors v. State of Karnataka &amp;  Ors.</a>[8],  the  Court\nheld that fair trial is the main  object  of  criminal  procedure  and  such\nfairness should not be hampered or threatened  in  any  manner.  Fair  trial\nmust be accorded to every accused in the spirit of the  right  to  life  and\npersonal liberty and the  accused  must  get  a  free  and  fair,  just  and\nreasonable trial on the charge imputed in  a  criminal  case.  It  has  been\nfurther observed that any breach or violation of public  rights  and  duties\nadversely affects the community as a whole and it  becomes  harmful  to  the\nsociety in general and, therefore, in all circumstances, the courts  have  a\nduty to maintain public confidence in  the  administration  of  justice  and\nsuch duty is to vindicate and uphold  the  “majesty  of  the  law”  and  the\ncourts cannot turn a blind eye  to  vexatious  or  oppressive  conduct  that\noccurs in relation to criminal proceedings.  The  Court  further  laid  down\nthat denial of a fair trial is as much injustice to the  accused  as  is  to\nthe victim and the society.  It  necessarily  requires  a  trial  before  an\nimpartial Judge, a fair prosecutor  and  an  atmosphere  of  judicial  calm.\nSince the object of the trial is to mete out  justice  and  to  convict  the\nguilty and protect the innocent, the trial should be a search for the  truth\nand not about over technicalities and must be conducted under such rules  as\nwill protect the innocent and punish the guilty. Justice should not only  be\ndone but should be seen to have been done. Therefore, free  and  fair  trial\nis a sine qua non of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_176\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. Right  to  get  a  fair\ntrial is not only a  basic  fundamental  right,  but  a  human  right  also.\nTherefore, any hindrance in a fair trial could be violative  of  <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_177\">Article  14</a>\nof  the  Constitution.   Elevating  the  right  of  fair  trial,  the  Court\nobserved:-</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1134833\" id=\"span_15\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"411958\" id=\"span_16\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1200243\" id=\"span_17\">“Article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  provides  for  the\nright to a fair trial what is enshrined in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_178\">Article 21</a> of  our  Constitution.\nTherefore, fair trial is the heart of criminal jurisprudence and, in a  way,\nan important facet of a democratic polity and is governed  by  the  rule  of\nlaw.

Both are viewed in the social context. The view  of  the  victim  is\ngiven due regard and respect in certain countries.  In  respect  of  certain\noffences in our  existing  criminal  jurisprudence,  the  testimony  of  the\nvictim is given paramount importance. Sometimes it is perceived that  it  is\nthe duty of the court to  see  that  the  victim’s  right  is  protected.

Sheikh</a> (supra), it has been held:-</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_38\">“38. A criminal trial is a judicial examination of the issues  in  the  case\nand its purpose is to arrive at a judgment on an  issue  as  to  a  fact  or\nrelevant facts which may lead to the discovery of the fact issue and  obtain\nproof of such facts at which the prosecution and the  accused  have  arrived\nby their pleadings; the controlling question being the  guilt  or  innocence\nof the accused. Since the object is to mete out justice and to  convict  the\nguilty and protect the innocent, the trial should be a search for the  truth\nand not about over technicalities, and must be conducted  under  such  rules\nas will protect the innocent, and punish the guilty.  The  proof  of  charge\nwhich  has  to  be  beyond  reasonable  doubt  must  depend  upon   judicial\nevaluation of the totality of the evidence,  oral  and  circumstantial,  and\nnot by an isolated scrutiny.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_39\">39. Failure to accord fair hearing either to the accused or the  prosecution\nviolates even minimum standards of due process of law.  It  is  inherent  in\nthe concept of due process of law,  that  condemnation  should  be  rendered\nonly after the trial in which the hearing is a real one, not sham or a  mere\nfarce and pretence. Since  the  fair  hearing  requires  an  opportunity  to\npreserve the process, it may be  vitiated  and  violated  by  an  overhasty,\nstage-managed, tailored and partisan trial.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_40\">40. The fair trial for a criminal offence consists  not  only  in  technical\nobservance of the frame and forms of law, but also in recognition  and  just\napplication of its principles in  substance,  to  find  out  the  truth  and\nprevent miscarriage of justice.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\">40.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"185913157\" id=\"span_32\">In <a href=\"/doc/185913157/\" id=\"a_198\">Mohd. Hussain @ Julfikar Ali</a>  (supra)  the  three-Judge  Bench  has\ndrawn a distinction between the speedy trial and fair trial by opining  that\nthere is, however, qualitative difference between the right to speedy  trial\nand the accused’s right of fair trial. Unlike the accused’s  right  of  fair\ntrial, deprivation of the right to speedy trial does not  per  se  prejudice\nthe accused in defending himself. The right to speedy trial is in  its  very\nnature relative. It depends upon diverse circumstances. Each case  of  delay\nin conclusion of  a  criminal  trial  has  to  be  seen  in  the  facts  and\ncircumstances  of  such  case.  Mere  lapse  of  several  years  since   the\ncommencement of prosecution by itself may not justify the discontinuance  of\nprosecution  or  dismissal  of  indictment.  The  factors   concerning   the\naccused’s right to speedy trial have to be weighed vis-à-vis the  impact  of\nthe crime on society and the confidence of the people  in  judicial  system.\nSpeedy trial secures rights to an accused  but  it  does  not  preclude  the\nrights  of  public  justice.  The  nature  and  gravity  of  crime,  persons\ninvolved, social impact and societal needs must be weighed  along  with  the\nright of the accused to speedy trial and if the balance tilts in  favour  of\nthe former the long  delay  in  conclusion  of  criminal  trial  should  not\noperate against the continuation of prosecution and  if  the  right  of  the\naccused in the facts  and  circumstances  of  the  case  and  exigencies  of\nsituation tilts the balance in his favour, the prosecution  may  be  brought\nto an end.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_40\">41.

They  cannot  expropriate  or  hijack  the\ncommunity  interest  by  conducting  themselves  in  such  a  manner  as   a\nconsequence of which the trial becomes a  mock  trial.   The  Court  further\nruled that a criminal trial is  a  serious  concern  of  society  and  every\nmember of the collective has an inherent  interest  in  such  a  trial  and,\ntherefore, the court is duty-bound to see that neither the  prosecution  nor\nthe defence takes unnecessary adjournments and take the  trial  under  their\ncontrol.   The said observations were made keeping in view  the  concept  of\nfair  trial,  the  obligation  of  the  prosecution,  the  interest  of  the\ncommunity and the duty of the court.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_42\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"69347951\" id=\"span_34\">43.   Recently, in <a href=\"/doc/69347951/\" id=\"a_200\">State  of  Haryana  v.  Ram  Mehar  and  Ors.</a>[28],  after\nanalyzing the earlier judgments, the Court ruled that  the  concept  of  the\nfair trial is neither in the realm of abstraction or a vague idea.  It is  a\nconcrete phenomenon; it is not rigid and there cannot  be  any  straitjacket\nformula for applying the  same.   The  Court  observed  that  it  cannot  be\nattributed or clothed with any  kind  of  rigidity  or  flexibility  in  its\napplication. It is because fair trial in its ambit requires fairness to  the\naccused, the victim and the collective  at  large.   The  Court  ruled  that\nneither the accused nor the prosecution nor the victim which is  a  part  of\nthe society can  claim  absolute  predominance  over  the  other,  for  once\nabsolute predominance is recognised, it will have  the  effect  potentiality\nto bring in an anarchical  disorder  in  the  conducting  of  trial  defying\nestablished legal  norm.   The  Court  opined  that  whole  thing  would  be\ndependent  on  the  fact  situation;  established   norms   and   recognised\nprinciples and eventual appreciation of the factual  scenario  in  entirety.\nThere may be cases which may command compartmentalisation but it  cannot  be\nstated to be an inflexible rule.  Each  and  every  irregularity  cannot  be\nimported to  the  arena  of  fair  trial.  There  may  be  situations  where\ninjustice to the victim may play a pivotal role. The centripodal purpose  is\nto  see  that  injustice  is  avoided   when   the   trial   is   conducted.\nSimultaneously the concept of fair  trial  cannot  be  allowed  to  such  an\nextent so that the systemic order of conducting a trial in  accordance  with\n<a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_201\">CrPC</a> or other enactments get mortgaged to  the  whims  and  fancies  of  the\ndefence or the prosecution. The command of the Code cannot be thrown to  the\nwinds. In such situation, as has been <a href=\"/doc/69347951/\" id=\"a_202\">laid down in</a> many  an  authority,  the\ncourts have significantly an eminent role.  A plea of fair trial  cannot  be\nacquiesced to create an  organic  disorder  in  the  system.  It  cannot  be\nacceded to manure a fertile mind to usher in the nemesis of the  concept  of\ntrial as such.  The Court further observed that  there  should  not  be  any\ninference that the fair trial should not be kept on its own pedestal  as  it\nought to remain but as far as its  applicability  is  concerned,  the  party\ninvoking it has to establish with the  support  of  established  principles.\nThe process of the court cannot be abused in the name of fair trial  at  the\ndrop of a hat, as that would lead to miscarriage of justice.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_43\">44.   On a studied analysis of the concept of  fair  trial  as  a  facet  of\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_203\">Article 21</a>, it is noticeable that in its ambit and sweep it covers  interest\nof the accused, prosecution and the victim.  The victim, may be  a  singular\nperson, who has suffered, but the injury suffered by singular is  likely  to\naffect the community interest.   Therefore,  the  collective  under  certain\ncircumstances and in certain cases, assume the position of the victim.  They\nmay not be entitled to compensation as conceived under <a href=\"/doc/158101963/\" id=\"a_204\">section 357A</a>  of  the\nCrPC but their anxiety and concern of the crime and desire to  prevent  such\noccurrences and that the perpetrator, if guilty, should be  punished,  is  a\nfacet of  Rule  of  Law.   And  that  has  to  be  accepted  and  ultimately\nprotected.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_44\">45.   It is settled in law that the right under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_205\">Article 21</a> is not  absolute.\nIt can be curtailed in accordance with law. The curtailment of the right  is\npermissible by following due procedure  which  can  withstand  the  test  of\nreasonableness.  Submission that if the accused is transferred from jail  in\nSiwan to any other jail outside the State of Bihar, his right to fair  trial\nwould be smothered and there will be an inscription of an obituary  of  fair\ntrial and refutation of the said proponement, that the accused  neither  has\nmonopoly over the process nor does he has any  exclusively  absolute  right,\nrequires a balanced resolution. The opposite arguments are  both  predicated\non the  precept  of  fair  trial  and  the  said  scale  would  decide  this\ncontroversy. The interest of the victim is relevant  and  has  to  be  taken\ninto consideration. The contention that if the accused is  not  shifted  out\nof Siwan Jail, the pending trials would result in  complete  farce,  for  no\nwitness would be in a position to depose against  him  and  they,  in  total\nhaplessness, shall be bound to succumb to the feeling  of  accentuated  fear\nthat is created by his unseen tentacles, is not an artifice  and  cannot  be\nignored. In such a situation, this Court should balance the  rights  between\nthe accused and the victims and thereafter weigh on the scale of fair  trial\nwhether shifting is necessary or not.  It would be  travesty  if  we  ignore\nthe assertion that if the respondent No. 3 is not shifted  from  Siwan  Jail\nand the trial is held at Siwan, justice, which is necessitous to be done  in\naccordance  with  law,  will  suffer  an  unprecedented  set  back  and  the\npetitioners would remain in a constant state of fear that shall  melt  their\nbones.  This would imply balancing of rights.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_45\">46.   Having noted thus, as presently advised,  we  shall  first  advert  to\ncertain authorities that pertain to balancing of  rights.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"243002\" id=\"span_35\">In  <a href=\"/doc/243002/\" id=\"a_206\">Sakal  Paper\n(P) Ltd. &amp; Ors v. Union of India &amp; another</a>[29], the Court in the context  of\nfreedom of speech and expression, has held that freedom  of  speech  can  be\nrestricted only in the interests of the  security  of  the  State,  friendly\nrelations with foreign State,  public  order,  decency  or  morality  or  in\nrelation to contempt of court, defamation or incitement to  an  offence.  It\ncannot, like the freedom to carry on business, be curtailed in the  interest\nof the general public.  Analysing further, the Court held:-</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_41\">“It follows from this that the  State  cannot  make  a  law  which  directly\nrestricts one freedom even for securing  the  better  enjoyment  of  another\nfreedom. All the greater  reason,  therefore  for  holding  that  the  State\ncannot directly restrict one freedom by  placing  an  otherwise  permissible\nrestriction on another freedom.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_46\">47.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"80997184\" id=\"span_36\">In <a href=\"/doc/80997184/\" id=\"a_207\">Subramanian Swamy v.

One  fundamental\nright of a person may have to  coexist  in  harmony  with  the  exercise  of\nanother fundamental right by others  and  also  with  reasonable  and  valid\nexercise of power by the State in the light of the directive  principles  in\nthe interests of social welfare as a whole. The Court’s duty is to strike  a\nbalance between competing claims of different interests.</span> In DTC  v.  Mazdoor\nCongress[32] the Court has  ruled  that  articles  relating  to  fundamental\nrights are all parts of an integrated scheme in the Constitution  and  their\nwaters must mix to constitute that grand flow  of  unimpeded  and  impartial\njustice; social, economic and political,  and  of  equality  of  status  and\nopportunity which imply absence of  unreasonable  or  unfair  discrimination\nbetween individuals or groups or classes.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_47\">48.   In this context, it is also appropriate  to  refer  to  certain  other\ndecisions where the Court has dealt with the concept  of  competing  rights.\nWe are disposed to think that dictum  laid  therein  has  to  be  appositely\nappreciated.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"382721\" id=\"span_38\">In <a href=\"/doc/382721/\" id=\"a_211\">Mr. ‘X’ v.

Dealing  with   the   said\ncontroversy, the Court held as a human being, Ms ‘Y’  must  also  enjoy,  as\nshe obviously is entitled to, all the human rights available  to  any  other\nhuman being. This is apart from, and in addition to, the  fundamental  right\navailable to her under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_213\">Article 21</a>,  which  guarantees  “right  to  life”  to\nevery citizen of this country.

The aforesaid decision is an authority for the proposition that  there\ncan be a conflict between two individuals qua their right under  <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_216\">Article  21</a>\nof the Constitution and in such a situation, to weigh the balance  the  test\nthat is required to be applied is the test of  larger  public  interest  and\nfurther that would, in certain circumstances,  advance  public  morality  of\nthe day.  To  put  it  differently,  the  “greater  community  interest”  or\n“interest of the collective or social  order”  would  be  the  principle  to\nrecognize and accept the right of one which has to be protected.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_49\">50.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"1308071\" id=\"span_39\">In this context, reference to the pronouncement  in  <a href=\"/doc/1308071/\" id=\"a_217\">Rev.  Stainislaus\nv. State of M.P. and Ors.</a>[34] would be instructive.  In the said  case,  the\nConstitution Bench was dealing with two sets of appeals,  one  arising  from\nMadhya Pradesh that related to Madhya Pradesh Dharma Swatantraya  Adhiniyam,\n1968 and the other pertained to <a href=\"/doc/156263633/\" id=\"a_218\">Orissa Freedom of Religion Act,  1967</a>.   The\ntwo Acts insofar  as  they  were  concerned  with  prohibition  of  forcible\nconversion and punishment therefor, were similar.</span>  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"146351380\" id=\"span_40\">The larger  Bench  stated\nthe facts from <a href=\"/doc/146351380/\" id=\"a_219\">Madhya Pradesh</a> case which eventually travelled  to  the  High\nCourt.  The High Court ruled that that there was no  justification  for  the\nargument that <a href=\"/doc/1092263/\" id=\"a_220\">Sections 3</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1555874/\" id=\"a_221\">4</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1601096/\" id=\"a_222\">5</a> were violative of  <a href=\"/doc/86224/\" id=\"a_223\">Article  25(1)</a>  of  the\nConstitution.   The  High  Court  went  on  to  hold  that  those   Sections\n“establish  the  equality  of  religious  freedom  for   all   citizens   by\nprohibiting conversion by objectionable activities  such  as  conversion  by\nforce, fraud and by allurement”.  The Orissa Act was declared  to  be  ultra\nvires the Constitution by the High Court.  To  understand  the  controversy,\nthe Court posed the following questions:-</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_43\">“(1)  whether  the  two  Acts  were  violative  of  the  fundamental   right\nguaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/86224/\" id=\"a_224\">Article 25(1)</a> of the Constitution, and\n\n(2) whether the State Legislatures were competent to enact them?”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_50\">51.   It was contended before this Court that the right to  propagate  one’s\nreligion means the right to convert a person to one’s own religion and  such\na right is guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/86224/\" id=\"a_225\">Article 25(1)</a>  of  the  Constitution.   The  larger\nBench dealing with the said contention held:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_44\">“We have no doubt that it is in this sense that  the  word  ‘propagate’  has\nbeen used in <a href=\"/doc/86224/\" id=\"a_226\">Article 25(1)</a>, for what the article grants is not the right  to\nconvert another person to one’s own religion,  but  to  transmit  or  spread\none’s religion by an exposition of its tenets. It has to be remembered  that\n<a href=\"/doc/86224/\" id=\"a_227\">Article 25(1)</a> guarantees “freedom of conscience” to every citizen,  and  not\nmerely to the followers of  one  particular  religion,  and  that,  in  turn\npostulates that there is no fundamental right to convert another  person  to\none’s own religion because if a person purposely undertakes  the  conversion\nof another person to his religion,  as  distinguished  from  his  effort  to\ntransmit or spread the tenets of his religion, that  would  impinge  on  the\n“freedom of conscience” guaranteed  to  all  the  citizens  of  the  country\nalike.”\n\n      And again:-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_45\">“It has to be appreciated that the freedom  of  religion  enshrined  in  the\narticle is not guaranteed in respect of one religion only,  but  covers  all\nreligions alike, and it can be properly enjoyed by a person if he  exercises\nhis right in  a  manner  commensurate  with  the  like  freedom  of  persons\nfollowing the other religions. What is freedom for one, is freedom  for  the\nother, in equal measure, and there can therefore  be  no  such  thing  as  a\nfundamental right to convert any person to one’s own religion.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_51\">52.   The aforesaid judgment  clearly  lays  down,  though  in  a  different\ncontext, that what is freedom for one is also the freedom for the  other  in\nequal measure.  The perception is explicated when the Court  has  said  that\nit has to be remembered that <a href=\"/doc/86224/\" id=\"a_228\">Article 25(1)</a> guarantees freedom of  conscience\nto other citizens and not merely to followers  of  particular  religion  and\nthere is no fundamental right to  convert  another  person.   The  right  is\nguaranteed to  all  citizens.   The  right  to  propagate  or  spread  one’s\nreligion by an exposition of its tenets does  not  mean  one’s  religion  to\nconvert another person as it affects the fundamental  right  of  the  other.\nWe have referred to this authority as it has,  in  a  way,  dwelt  upon  the\n“intra-conflict of a fundamental right”.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_52\">53.   Be it stated,  circumstances  may  emerge  that  may  necessitate  for\nbalancing  between  intra-fundamental  rights.   It  has   been   distinctly\nunderstood that the test that has to be  applied  while  balancing  the  two\nfundamental rights or inter fundamental rights, the principles  applied  may\nbe different than the principle to be applied in intra-conflict between  the\nsame fundamental right. To elaborate, as in this case,  the  accused  has  a\nfundamental  right  to  have  a  fair  trial  under  <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_229\">Article   21</a>   of   the\nConstitution.  Similarly, the victims who are  directly  affected  and  also\nform a part of the constituent of the collective, have a  fundamental  right\nfor  a  fair  trial.   Thus,  there  can  be  two  individuals  both  having\nlegitimacy to claim or assert the right.  The  factum  of  legitimacy  is  a\nprimary consideration. It has to be remembered that no fundamental right  is\nabsolute and  it  can  have  limitations  in  certain  circumstances.  Thus,\npermissible limitations are imposed by the State.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"129750439\" id=\"span_41\">The said limitations  are\nto be within the bounds of law. However, when  there  is  intra-conflict  of\nthe right conferred under the same Article, like fair trial  in  this  case,\nthe test that is required to be applied, we are disposed to think, it  would\nbe “paramount collective interest” or “sustenance of  public  confidence  in\nthe justice dispensation system”.  An example can  be  cited.   A  group  of\npersons in the name of “class honour”, as has been  stated  in  <a href=\"/doc/129750439/\" id=\"a_230\">Vikas  Yadav\nv. State of U.P. &amp; Ors.</a>[35], cannot curtail or  throttle  the  choice  of  a\nwoman.  It is because choice of woman in choosing her partner in life  is  a\nlegitimate constitutional right.  It is founded on  individual  choice  that\nis recognized in the Constitution under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_231\">Article 19</a>, and such a right is  not\nexpected to succumb to the concept of “class honour”  or  “group  thinking”.\nIt is because the sense of class honour has no  legitimacy  even  if  it  is\npractised by the collective under some kind of a notion.  Therefore, if  the\ncollective interest or the public interest that serves the public cause  and\nfurther has the legitimacy to claim or  assert  a  fundamental  right,  then\nonly it can put forth that their right should be protected.   There  can  be\nno denial of the fact that the rights of the victims for a fair trial is  an\ninseparable aspect of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_232\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution and  when  they  assert\nthat right by themselves as  well  as  the   part  of  the  collective,  the\nconception of public  interest  gets  galvanised.   The  accentuated  public\ninterest in such circumstances has to be given primacy, for it furthers  and\npromotes “Rule of Law”.  It may be  clarified  at  once  that  the  test  of\nprimacy which is based on legitimacy and  the  public  interest  has  to  be\nadjudged on the facts of each case and cannot be stated in  abstract  terms.\nIt will require studied scanning of facts, the competing interests  and  the\nultimate perception of the balancing that would subserve the  larger  public\ninterest and serve the majesty of rule of  law.   In  this  regard,  we  are\nreminded of an ancient saying:-</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_46\">                       “yadapi siddham, loka viruddham\n                       Na adaraniyam, na acharaniyam”\n       The  aforesaid  saying  lays  stress  on  public  interest  and   its\nsignificance and primacy over certain individual interest.  It may not  thus\nhave general application, but the purpose of referring to the same  is  that\non certain occasions it can be treated to be appropriate.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_53\">54.   There may be a perception that  if  principle  of  primacy  is  to  be\nfollowed, then the right of one gets totally extinguished.   It  has  to  be\nborne in mind that total extinction is not balancing.   When  balancing  act\nis done, the right to  fair  trial  is  not  totally  crippled,  but  it  is\ncurtailed to some extent by which the accused gets the right of  fair  trial\nand simultaneously, the victims feel that the fair trial  is  conducted  and\nthe court feels assured that there is  a  fair  trial  in  respect  of  such\ncases.  That apart, the faith of the collective is reposed in  the  criminal\njustice dispensation system and remains anchored.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_54\">55.    While  appreciating  the  concept  of  public  interest  in  such   a\nsituation, the Court is required to engage itself in construing the  process\nof fair trial which ultimately subserves the cause of  justice  and  remains\ncloser to constitutional sensibility.  An  accused,  in  the  name  of  fair\ntrial, cannot go on seeking adjournments defeating the basic purpose  behind\nthe conducting of a trial as enshrined under <a href=\"/doc/1645292/\" id=\"a_233\">Section 309</a>  CrPC.   He  cannot\ngo on filing applications under various provisions of <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_234\">CrPC</a>, whether  tenable\nor not, and put forth a plea on each and every occasion on the bedrock  that\nprinciple of fair trial sanctions it.  In such  a  situation,  as  has  been\nheld  by  this  Court,  the  prosecution  which  represents  the  cause   of\ncollective  and  the  victim,  who  fights  for  remedy  of  his  individual\ngrievance, is allowed to have a say and the court is not expected  to  be  a\nsilent spectator.  Thus, the  discord  that  arises  when  there  is  intra-\nconflict in the same fundamental right especially, in the  context  of  fair\ntrial, it has to  be  resolved  regard  being  had  to  the  obtaining  fact\nsituation.  An accused who has been able to, by his  sheer  presence,  erode\nthe idea of safety of a witness in court or  for  that  matter  impairs  and\nrusts the faith of a victim in the ultimate justice and such erosion is  due\nto fear psychosis prevalent in  the  atmosphere  of  trial,  is  not  to  be\ncountenanced as it is an unconscionable situation. Such a hazard is  not  to\nbe silently suffered because the “Majesty of Justice” does  not  allow  such\nkinds of complaints  to  survive.  Thus  analysed,  the  submission  of  Mr.\nNaphade that shifting of the accused outside the  Siwan  Jail  would  affect\nhis  right  under  <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_235\">Article  21</a>  of  the  Constitution   does   not   commend\nacceptation.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_55\">56.   The next  limb  of  controversy  relates  to  exercise  of  power  and\njurisdiction.  The plea that is propounded by Mr. Naphade  is  that  in  the\nabsence of any provision in the 1950 Act, there cannot be any direction  for\nshifting.  According to him, any State action which prejudices the right  of\nan individual has to be backed by the authority of law and  in  the  absence\nof law, such an order is not permissible.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"766560\" id=\"span_42\">In  this  regard,  he  has  drawn\ninspiration from a passage from the  <a href=\"/doc/766560/\" id=\"a_236\">State  of  M.P.  &amp;  another  v.  Thakur\nBharat Singh</a>[36].  It reads as follows:-</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_47\">“All executive action which operates to the prejudice  of  any  person  must\nhave the authority of law to support it, and the terms  of  <a href=\"/doc/147929/\" id=\"a_237\">Article  358</a>  do\nnot detract from that rule. <a href=\"/doc/147929/\" id=\"a_238\">Article 358</a> expressly authorises  the  State  to\ntake legislative or executive action provided such action was competent  for\nthe State to make or take, but for the provisions contained in Part  III  of\nthe Constitution. <a href=\"/doc/147929/\" id=\"a_239\">Article 358</a> does not purport  to  invest  the  State  with\narbitrary authority to take action to the prejudice of citizens and  others:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_48\">it merely provides that so long as the proclamation  of  emergency  subsists\nlaws may be enacted, and exclusive action  may  be  taken  in  pursuance  of\nlawful authority, which if the  provisions  of  <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_240\">Article  19</a>  were  operative\nwould have been invalid.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_56\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"766560\" id=\"span_43\">57.   The aforesaid contention has a  fundamental  fallacy  and,  therefore,\nthe authority in <a href=\"/doc/766560/\" id=\"a_241\">Thakur Bharat Singh</a> (supra) has  no  application.   In  the\ncase at hand, no State action is under challenge.   The  plea  of  prejudice\nthat has been advanced has no legs to stand upon  as  the  petitioners  have\napproached this Court for directions.  It is well settled in law that  there\nis a distinction between a judicial function  and  the  legislative  action,\nand similarly the executive action and a direction from the Court.</span>   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"63503501\" id=\"span_44\">It  has\nbeen lucidly clarified by the Constitution Bench in <a href=\"/doc/63503501/\" id=\"a_242\">State of W.B. &amp;  Ors  v.\nCommittee</a> for Protection of Democratic Rights, West Bengal &amp;  Ors[37].   The\nquestion arose in the said case was whether the High Court  in  exercise  of\njurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_243\">Article 226</a>  of  the  Constitution  can  direct  the  CBI\nestablished under the <a href=\"/doc/1692639/\" id=\"a_244\">Delhi Special  Police  Establishment  Act,  1946</a>  (for\nshort, ‘Special Police Act’) to investigate a cognizable  offence  which  is\nalleged to have taken place within the territorial jurisdiction of  a  State\nwithout the consent of the State Government.   After  referring  to  various\nprovisions of the Special Police Act, the Court posed the question  “whether\nthe restrictions imposed on the  powers  of  the  Central  Government  would\napply mutatis mutandis to constitutional courts as well”  and  referring  to\nvarious authorities, recorded number of conclusions, of which  we  reproduce\nthe relevant ones:-</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_49\">“(i) The fundamental rights, enshrined in Part III of the Constitution,  are\ninherent and cannot be  extinguished  by  any  constitutional  or  statutory\nprovision.  Any  law  that  abrogates  or  abridges  such  rights  would  be\nviolative of the basic structure doctrine. The actual effect and  impact  of\nthe law on the rights guaranteed  under  Part  III  has  to  be  taken  into\naccount in determining whether or not it destroys the basic structure.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_50\">(ii) <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_245\">Article 21</a> of the  Constitution  in  its  broad  perspective  seeks  to\nprotect the persons of their lives and personal liberties  except  according\nto the  procedure  established  by  law.  The  said  article  in  its  broad\napplication not only takes within its fold enforcement of the rights  of  an\naccused but also the rights of the victim. The State has a duty  to  enforce\nthe  human  rights  of  a  citizen  providing   for   fair   and   impartial\ninvestigation against any person  accused  of  commission  of  a  cognizable\noffence, which may include its own officers. In certain  situations  even  a\nwitness to the crime may seek for and shall be  granted  protection  by  the\nState.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_51\">(iii) In view of the constitutional scheme and  the  jurisdiction  conferred\non this Court under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_246\">Article 32</a> and on the High Courts under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_247\">Article  226</a>  of\nthe Constitution the power of judicial review being an integral part of  the\nbasic structure of the Constitution, no Act of  Parliament  can  exclude  or\ncurtail  the  powers  of  the  constitutional  courts  with  regard  to  the\nenforcement of fundamental rights. As a matter of  fact,  such  a  power  is\nessential to give practicable content to the objectives of the  Constitution\nembodied in Part III and other parts of the  Constitution.  Moreover,  in  a\nfederal  constitution,  the  distribution  of  legislative  powers   between\nParliament and the State  Legislature  involves  limitation  on  legislative\npowers and, therefore, this requires an authority other than  Parliament  to\nascertain whether such limitations are transgressed.  Judicial  review  acts\nas the final arbiter  not  only  to  give  effect  to  the  distribution  of\nlegislative powers between Parliament and  the  State  Legislatures,  it  is\nalso necessary to show any  transgression  by  each  entity.  Therefore,  to\nborrow the words of Lord Steyn, judicial review is justified by  combination\nof “the principles of separation of powers, rule of law,  the  principle  of\nconstitutionality and the reach of judicial review”.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_52\">(iv) If the federal structure is violated by  any  legislative  action,  the\nConstitution takes care to protect the federal structure  by  ensuring  that\nthe Courts act  as  guardians  and  interpreters  of  the  Constitution  and\nprovide remedy under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_248\">Articles 32</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_249\">226</a>, whenever  there  is  an  attempted\nviolation. In the circumstances, any direction by the Supreme Court  or  the\nHigh Court in exercise of power under  <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_250\">Article  32</a>  or  226  to  uphold  the\nConstitution and maintain the rule of law cannot be termed as violating  the\nfederal structure.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_53\">(v) Restriction on Parliament by the Constitution  and  restriction  on  the\nexecutive by Parliament under an enactment, do not amount to restriction  on\nthe power of the Judiciary under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_251\">Articles 32</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_252\">226</a> of the Constitution.”\n\n      And eventually, the Court answered the reference thus:-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_54\">“In the final analysis, our answer  to  the  question  referred  is  that  a\ndirection by the High Court, in exercise of its jurisdiction  under  <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_253\">Article\n226</a> of the Constitution, to CBI to investigate a cognizable offence  alleged\nto have been committed within the territory of a State without  the  consent\nof that State will  neither  impinge  upon  the  federal  structure  of  the\nConstitution nor violate the doctrine of separation of power  and  shall  be\nvalid in law. Being the protectors of civil liberties of the citizens,  this\nCourt and the High Courts have not only the power and jurisdiction but  also\nan obligation to protect the fundamental rights, guaranteed by Part  III  in\ngeneral and under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_254\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution  in  particular,  zealously\nand vigilantly.”\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_57\">58.   The aforesaid decision compels us  to  repel  the  submission  of  Mr.\nNaphade on this score  which  is  to  the  effect  that  when  no  power  is\nconferred under the 1950 Act, the Court cannot exercise the  power  or  when\nthe power is curtailed, the Court cannot issue directions.  The  controversy\nin the Constitution Bench pertained  to  direction  by  the  High  Court  to\ntransfer the investigation to the CBI in respect of the  crime  that  occurs\nwithin the territory of the State and this Court held that  the  High  Court\nhas the authority to so direct despite  the  prohibition  contained  in  the\nSpecial Police Act.  Therefore, the non-conferment of power under  the  1950\nAct would not prohibit the High  Court,  in  exercise  of  its  power  under\n<a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_255\">Article 226</a> to transfer a case from one jail to  another  inside  the  State\ndepending upon the circumstances.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_58\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1945293\" id=\"span_45\">59.

It  is\nsubmitted by Mr. Naphade that an order under <a href=\"/doc/500307/\" id=\"a_259\">Article 142</a>  cannot  be  passed\nin violation of the rights under Part III of the Constitution  nor  such  an\norder can be inconsistent with the substantive provisions  of  the  relevant\nstatute.

Therefore, we do not think it would be possible to hold  that  <a href=\"/doc/167918515/\" id=\"a_261\">Article\n142(1)</a> confers upon this Court powers which can  contravene  the  provisions\nof Article 32.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_59\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1353689\" id=\"span_46\">60.

While  elucidating  the  principle  under\n<a href=\"/doc/500307/\" id=\"a_269\">Article 142</a>, Sabyasachi Mukharji, J. (as His Lordship then was) ruled:-</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_56\">“The fact that the rule  was  discretionary  did  not  alter  the  position.\nThough <a href=\"/doc/167918515/\" id=\"a_270\">Article 142(1)</a> empowers the Supreme Court to pass  any  order  to  do\ncomplete justice between  the  parties,  the  court  cannot  make  an  order\ninconsistent with the fundamental rights  guaranteed  by  Part  III  of  the\nConstitution. No  question  of  inconsistency  between  <a href=\"/doc/167918515/\" id=\"a_271\">Article  142(1)</a>  and\n<a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_272\">Article 32</a> arose. Gajendragadkar, J.,  speaking  for  the  majority  of  the\njudges of this Court said that <a href=\"/doc/167918515/\" id=\"a_273\">Article 142(1)</a> did not confer  any  power  on\nthis Court to contravene the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_274\">Article 32</a> of  the  Constitution.\nNor did <a href=\"/doc/1537130/\" id=\"a_275\">Article 145</a> confer power upon this Court to make  rules,  empowering\nit to contravene the provisions of the fundamental right.  At  page  899  of\nthe Reports, Gajendragadkar, J., reiterated that the powers  of  this  Court\nare no doubt very wide and they are intended and “will always  be  exercised\nin the interests of justice”. But that is not to say that an  order  can  be\nmade by this  Court  which  is  inconsistent  with  the  fundamental  rights\nguaranteed by Part III of the Constitution. It was emphasised that an  order\nwhich this Court could make in order to  do  complete  justice  between  the\nparties, must not only be consistent with the fundamental rights  guaranteed\nby  the  Constitution,  but  it  cannot  even  be  inconsistent   with   the\nsubstantive provisions of the relevant statutory laws  (emphasis  supplied).\nThe court therefore, held that it was not  possible  to  hold  that  <a href=\"/doc/167918515/\" id=\"a_276\">Article\n142(1)</a>  conferred  upon  this  Court  powers  which  could  contravene   the\nprovisions of Article 32.”\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_57\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"243002\" id=\"span_48\">61.   Relying on the aforesaid dictum, it is canvassed by Mr.  Naphade  that\nwhen the transfer of an accused from one State to another is  not  envisaged\nunder the 1950 Act, and the concept of fair trial commands that  an  accused\nhas to be tried fairly and should not be removed to a  distant  place  where\nhe would feel isolated and cut-off from his relations and  familiar  milieu,\nfor it would tantamount  to  violation  of  the  right  as  enshrined  under\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_277\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution.  He would further contend that  power  under\n<a href=\"/doc/500307/\" id=\"a_278\">Article 142</a> cannot be exercised that would create a dent in the  fundamental\nright or would be inconsistent with the statutory provisions.  Controverting\nthe aforesaid submission,  Mr.  Bhushan,  learned  senior  counsel  for  the\npetitioners has drawn our attention to  a  Constitution  Bench  judgment  in\n<a href=\"/doc/243002/\" id=\"a_279\">Union Carbide Corporation</a> (supra). In paragraph 83, M.N. Venkatachaliah,  J,\n(as His Lordship then was) speaking for the majority, opined thus:-</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_58\">“It is necessary to set at rest  certain  misconceptions  in  the  arguments\ntouching the scope of the powers of this Court under <a href=\"/doc/167918515/\" id=\"a_280\">Article 142(1)</a>  of  the\nConstitution. These issues are matters of  serious  public  importance.  The\nproposition that a  provision  in  any  ordinary  law  irrespective  of  the\nimportance of the public policy on which it is founded,  operates  to  limit\nthe powers of the apex Court under <a href=\"/doc/167918515/\" id=\"a_281\">Article 142(1)</a> is unsound and  erroneous.\nIn both Garg as well as Antulay cases the point  was  one  of  violation  of\nconstitutional provisions and constitutional rights. The observations as  to\nthe  effect  of  inconsistency  with  statutory   provisions   were   really\nunnecessary in those cases as the decisions in the ultimate analysis  turned\non the breach of constitutional rights. We agree with Shri Nariman that  the\npower of the Court  under  <a href=\"/doc/500307/\" id=\"a_282\">Article  142</a>  insofar  as  quashing  of  criminal\nproceedings are concerned is not exhausted by Section  320  or  321  or  482\n<a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_283\">CrPC</a> or all of them put together. The power  under  <a href=\"/doc/500307/\" id=\"a_284\">Article  142</a>  is  at  an\nentirely different  level  and  of  a  different  quality.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1945293\" id=\"span_49\">Prohibitions  or\nlimitations or provisions contained in ordinary  laws  cannot,  ipso  facto,\nact as prohibitions  or  limitations  on  the  constitutional  powers  under\n<a href=\"/doc/500307/\" id=\"a_285\">Article 142.</a> Such prohibitions or limitations in the statutes  might  embody\nand reflect the scheme of a particular law, taking into account  the  nature\nand status of the authority or the court on which  conferment  of  powers  —\nlimited in some appropriate way — is contemplated. The limitations  may  not\nnecessarily reflect or be based on any fundamental considerations of  public\npolicy. Sri Sorabjee, learned Attorney  General,  referring  to  <a href=\"/doc/1945293/\" id=\"a_286\">Garg</a>  case,\nsaid  that  limitation  on  the  powers  under  <a href=\"/doc/500307/\" id=\"a_287\">Article  142</a>  arising   from\n“inconsistency with express statutory provisions of  substantive  law”  must\nreally mean and be understood as some express prohibition contained  in  any\nsubstantive  statutory  law.   He   suggested   that   if   the   expression\n‘prohibition’ is read in place of ‘provision’ that would perhaps convey  the\nappropriate idea. But we think that such prohibition should  also  be  shown\nto be based on some underlying fundamental  and  general  issues  of  public\npolicy and not  merely  incidental  to  a  particular  statutory  scheme  or\npattern. It will again be wholly incorrect to say that powers under  <a href=\"/doc/500307/\" id=\"a_288\">Article\n142</a> are subject to such express statutory prohibitions.  That  would  convey\nthe idea that statutory  provisions  override  a  constitutional  provision.</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_60\">Perhaps, the proper way of expressing the idea is that in exercising  powers\nunder <a href=\"/doc/500307/\" id=\"a_289\">Article 142</a> and in assessing the needs  of  “complete  justice”  of  a\ncause or matter, the apex Court will take note of the  express  prohibitions\nin any substantive statutory provision based on some fundamental  principles\nof public policy and regulate the  exercise  of  its  power  and  discretion\naccordingly. The proposition does not relate to  the  powers  of  the  Court\nunder <a href=\"/doc/500307/\" id=\"a_290\">Article 142</a>, but only to what is or is not  ‘complete  justice’  of  a\ncause or matter and in  the  ultimate  analysis  of  the  propriety  of  the\nexercise of the power. No question of lack of  jurisdiction  or  of  nullity\ncan arise”.

Union  of\nIndia and Anr.</a>[41]. In the said case, the Court  dealing  with  the  plenary\npower under <a href=\"/doc/500307/\" id=\"a_296\">Article 142</a> of the Constitution opined that the  plenary  powers\nof this Court under <a href=\"/doc/500307/\" id=\"a_297\">Article 142</a> of the  Constitution  are  inherent  in  the\nCourt  and  are  complementary  to  those  powers  which  are   specifically\nconferred on the Court by various statutes though are not limited  by  those\nstatutes. These powers also exist independent of the statutes  with  a  view\nto do complete justice between the parties. These powers are  of  very  wide\namplitude and are in the nature of supplementary powers. This  power  exists\nas  a  separate  and  independent  basis  of  jurisdiction  apart  from  the\nstatutes. It stands upon the foundation and the basis for its  exercise  may\nbe put on a different and perhaps even wider footing, to  prevent  injustice\nin the process  of  litigation  and  to  do  complete  justice  between  the\nparties. This plenary jurisdiction is, thus, the residual  source  of  power\nwhich this Court may  draw  upon  as  necessary  whenever  it  is  just  and\nequitable to do so and in particular to ensure the  observance  of  the  due\nprocess  of  law,  to  do  complete  justice  between  the  parties,   while\nadministering justice according to law. Thereafter, the Court held:-</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_59\">“There is no doubt that it is an indispensable adjunct to all  other  powers\nand is free from the restraint of jurisdiction and operates  as  a  valuable\nweapon in the hands of the Court to prevent “clogging or obstruction of  the\nstream of justice”. It, however, needs to  be  remembered  that  the  powers\nconferred on the Court by <a href=\"/doc/500307/\" id=\"a_298\">Article 142</a> being curative  in  nature  cannot  be\nconstrued as powers which authorise the  Court  to  ignore  the  substantive\nrights of a litigant while dealing with a  cause  pending  before  it.  This\npower cannot be used to “supplant” substantive law applicable  to  the  case\nor cause under consideration of the Court. <a href=\"/doc/500307/\" id=\"a_299\">Article 142</a>, even with the  width\nof its amplitude, cannot be used to build a new edifice where  none  existed\nearlier, by ignoring express statutory provisions  dealing  with  a  subject\nand thereby  to  achieve  something  indirectly  which  cannot  be  achieved\ndirectly….”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_63\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"243002\" id=\"span_54\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1945293\" id=\"span_55\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1496509\" id=\"span_56\">64.

In the context of the aforesaid authorities,  the  submission  of  Mr.\nNaphade is to be appreciated.

He  further\nsubmits that this Court cannot legislate under <a href=\"/doc/500307/\" id=\"a_330\">Article 142</a> and  equity  must\nyield to the provisions of law.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_67\">68.   There can be no doubt that equity cannot override law. As far  as  the\nfirst aspect is concerned, we need not  advert  to  the  broad  platform  on\nwhich Mr. Naphade has based his contention. Suffice it to note that  <a href=\"/doc/1092263/\" id=\"a_331\">Section\n3</a> of the 1950 Act bestows power on  the  State  Government  to  transfer  an\naccused to another State after consulting the other State.  Such  an  action\nby the State has to be totally controlled by the  circumstances  which  find\nmention  under  <a href=\"/doc/1092263/\" id=\"a_332\">Section  3</a>.   When  the  State  passes  an  order  with  the\nconcurrence  of  another  State,  it  is  obliged  to  be   bound   by   the\ncircumstances which are postulated under <a href=\"/doc/1092263/\" id=\"a_333\">Section 3(1)</a> of the 1950  Act,  but\nwhen the issue of  fair  trial  emerges  before  the  constitutional  court,\n<a href=\"/doc/1092263/\" id=\"a_334\">Section 3</a> of the 1950 Act cannot be regarded so as  to  restrain  the  court\nfrom what is  mandated  and  required  for  a  free  and  fair  trial.   The\nstatutory power is not such which is negative  and  curtails  power  of  the\ncourt to act in the interest of justice, and ensure  free  and  fair  trial,\nwhich is of paramount importance for the Rule of Law. It only  controls  the\npower of the executive. Therefore, we are unable to  accept  the  submission\nof Mr. Naphade in this regard.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_68\">69.   Presently, we shall advert to the facts which we have  stated  in  the\nbeginning.   The third respondent has already been declared  as  a  history-\nsheeter type ‘A’, that is, who is beyond reform. Till  today,  he  has  been\nbooked in 75 cases, out of which he had  been  convicted  in  10  cases  and\npresently facing trial in 45 cases. There is no dispute  that  he  has  been\nacquitted in 20 cases.  Out of 45 cases, 21 cases are  those  where  maximum\nsentence is 7 years or more. He has been booked in 15  cases  where  he  has\nbeen in custody and one such case relates to the murder of the third son  of\nthe petitioner and other two cases are  of  attempt  to  murder.  He  is  an\ninfluential person of the locality, for he has been a representative to  the\nLegislative Assembly on two occasions and elected as a Member of  Parliament\nfour times.  This is not a normal and usual case. It has to  be  dealt  with\nin the aforesaid factual matrix. A history-sheeter has criminal  antecedents\nand sometimes becomes a terror in society. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"134501705\" id=\"span_72\">In <a href=\"/doc/134501705/\" id=\"a_335\">Neeru Yadav v. State  of  U.P.\nand Anr.</a>[50], this Court,  while  cancelling  bail  granted  to  a  history-\nsheeter, was compelled to observe:-</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_63\">“16. ….A democratic body  polity  which  is  wedded  to  the  rule  of  law,\nanxiously guards liberty. But, a pregnant and significant one,  the  liberty\nof an individual is not absolute. Society by its collective  wisdom  through\nprocess of law can withdraw  the  liberty  that  it  has  sanctioned  to  an\nindividual when an individual becomes a danger to the collective and to  the\nsocietal order. Accent on individual liberty cannot  be  pyramided  to  that\nextent which would bring chaos and anarchy to a society. A  society  expects\nresponsibility and accountability from its members, and it desires that  the\ncitizens should obey the law, respecting it as a cherished social  norm.  No\nindividual can make an attempt to create a concavity in the stem  of  social\nstream. It is impermissible. Therefore, when  an  individual  behaves  in  a\ndisharmonious  manner  ushering  in  disorderly  things  which  the  society\ndisapproves, the legal consequences are bound to follow. At that stage,  the\ncourt has a duty. It cannot abandon its sacrosanct obligation  and  pass  an\norder at its own whim or caprice. It has to be  guided  by  the  established\nparameters of law.”\n\n      We have referred to the  aforesaid  authority  to  highlight  how  the\nCourt has taken into consideration the paramountcy of peaceful social  order\nwhile cancelling the order of bail, for the order granting bail  was  passed\nwithout proper consideration of criminal antecedents of  the  accused  whose\nacts created a concavity in the social stream.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_69\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1521407\" id=\"span_73\">70.   Mr. Bhushan, learned senior counsel heavily relied  on  the  authority\nin  <a href=\"/doc/1521407/\" id=\"a_336\">Kalyan  Chandra  Sarkar  v.  Rajesh  Ranjan</a>  alias   Pappu   Yadav   and\nanother[51]. It is urged by him that factual matrix in  the  said  case  and\nthe present case is identical.  In the said case,  the  Court  noticed  that\nthe respondent therein, Rajesh Ranjan alias Pappu  Yadav  while  he  was  in\njudicial custody, was  found  addressing  an  election  meeting.  The  Court\ncalled for a  report  from  the  authorities  concerned  requiring  them  to\nexplain on what authority the said  respondent  was  allowed  to  address  a\npublic meeting. The report filed by the CBI revealed  that  the  respondent,\nin collusion with the police authorities accompanying him to Madhepura,  had\naddressed a public meeting and the  escort  accompanying  him  took  him  to\nvarious places which the respondent wanted to visit beyond the scope of  the\nproduction warrant. It had come to the knowledge of the  Court  that  though\nhis bail had been cancelled, the accused was never taken into jail  and,  in\nfact, when he was arrested after the cancellation of bail, he was  taken  to\nPatna and an urgent Medical Board  was  constituted  to  examine  him  which\nopined that the accused required medical treatment at Patna Medical  College\nand permitted him to stay in the said Medical College. Taking various  other\nfacts  into  consideration,  the  Court  opined  that  the  respondent   had\nabsolutely no respect for the Rule of Law nor was he, in any manner,  afraid\nof the consequences of his unlawful acts.  It was  also  observed  that,  it\nwas evident from the fact that some of the illegal acts  of  the  respondent\nwere committed even when his application for  grant  of  bail  was  pending.</span>\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"162242\" id=\"span_74\">When the issue of transfer from Beur Jail,  Patna  to  a  jail  outside  the\nState arose, a contention was advanced that it would affect his  fundamental\nright as has  been  enunciated  in  <a href=\"/doc/162242/\" id=\"a_337\">Sunil  Batra  (II</a>)  (supra).

It is true that in a normal trial the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_349\">Criminal Procedure Code</a>  requires\nthe accused to be present at the trial but in the peculiar circumstances  of\nthis case a procedure will have to be evolved, which will  not  be  contrary\nto the rights given to an accused under the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_350\">Criminal Procedure Code</a>  but  at\nthe same time protect the administration of justice. Therefore, as  held  by\nthis Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/560467/\" id=\"a_351\">State of Maharashtra v. Dr.  Praful  B.  Desai</a>[55]\nand <a href=\"/doc/1103956/\" id=\"a_352\">Sakshi v.

In  our\nopinion, this is one of those rare cases wherein a frequent visit  from  the\nplace of detention to the court  of  trial  in  Bihar  would  prejudice  the\nsecurity of both the respondent and others involved in the case, apart  from\nbeing a heavy burden on the State exchequer. It is in  this  background  CBI\nhas submitted that the  prisons  at  Chennai,  Palayamkottai  Central  Jail,\nVellore Central Jail, Coimbatore Central Jail all  in  the  State  of  Tamil\nNadu and  Mysore  Central  Jail  in  the  State  of  Karnataka  have  video-\nconferencing facilities. Therefore the respondent can be transferred to  any\none of those jails.</span></span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_66\">44. While it is true that it is necessary in  the  interest  of  justice  to\ntransfer the respondent out of the State of Bihar, we are required  to  keep\nin mind certain basic rights available to the respondent  which  should  not\nbe denied by transferring the respondent to any one of the  jails  suggested\nby CBI. It will cause  some  hardship  to  the  wife  and  children  of  the\nrespondent who we are told are normally residents of Delhi, his  wife  being\na Member of Parliament and two young children  going  to  school  in  Delhi.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_72\">Taking into consideration the overall fact situation of the case,  we  think\nit appropriate that the respondent be transferred to  Tihar  Jail  at  Delhi\nand we direct the seniormost officer in charge of Tihar Jail  to  make  such\narrangements as he thinks are necessary to prevent the reoccurrence  of  the\nactivities of the respondent of  the  nature  referred  to  hereinabove  and\nshall allow no special privileges to him unless he is entitled to  the  same\nin law. His conduct during his custody  in  Tihar  Jail  will  specially  be\nmonitored  and  if  necessary  be  reported  to  this  Court.  However,  the\nrespondent shall be entitled to the benefit of the visit of  his  family  as\nprovided for under the Jail Manual of Tihar. He shall also  be  entitled  to\nsuch categorisation and such facilities available to him in law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_73\">45. We also direct that the trial  of  the  case  in  Patna  shall  continue\nwithout the  presence  of  the  appellant  by  the  court,  dispensing  such\npresence, and to the extent possible shall be  conducted  with  the  aid  of\nvideo-conferencing. However, in the  event  of  the  respondent  making  any\napplication for his transfer for the sole purpose of  being  present  during\nthe recording of the statement of  any  particular  witness,  same  will  be\nconsidered by the learned Sessions Judge on its merit and if  he  thinks  it\nappropriate, he may direct the authorities of  Tihar  Jail  to  produce  the\naccused before him for that limited purpose. This, however,  will  be  in  a\nrare and important situation only and if such transfer  order  is  made  the\nrespondent shall be taken from Tihar Jail to  the  court  concerned  and  if\nneed be, detained in appropriate jail at the place of trial  and  under  the\ncustody and charge of the police to be specially deputed by the  authorities\nof Tihar Jail who shall bear in mind the  factual  situation  in  which  the\nrespondent has been transferred from Patna to Delhi.”\n\n      The aforesaid authority stands in  close  proximity  to  the  case  at\nhand.  The present case, in fact, frescoes a different picture and  projects\na sad scenario compelling us to take  immediate  steps,  while  safeguarding\nthe principle of fair trial for both the sides.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_74\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"560467\" id=\"span_84\">73.   It is fruitful to note that in <a href=\"/doc/560467/\" id=\"a_353\">Dr. Praful B. Desai</a>   (supra)   it  has\nbeen clearly held that recording of evidence by way  of  video  conferencing\nis valid in law.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_75\">74.   In view of the aforesaid  analysis,  we  record  our  conclusions  and\ndirections in seriatim:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_67\">    The right to fair trial is not singularly  absolute,  as  is  perceived,\nfrom the perspective of the accused. It takes in its  ambit  and  sweep  the\nright of the victim(s)  and  the  society  at  large.  These  factors  would\ncollectively allude and constitute the Rule of  Law,  i.e.,  free  and  fair\ntrial.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_68\">     The fair trial which is constitutionally  protected  as  a  substantial\nright under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_354\">Article 21</a> and also the statutory protection,  does  invite  for\nconsideration a sense of conflict with the interest of the victim(s) or  the\ncollective/interest of the society.  When  there  is  an  intra-conflict  in\nrespect of the same fundamental right from the true perceptions, it  is  the\nobligation of the constitutional courts to  weigh  the  balance  in  certain\ncircumstances, the interest of  the  society  as  a  whole,  when  it  would\npromote and instill Rule of Law.  A fair  trial  is  not  what  the  accused\nwants in the name of fair  trial.   Fair  trial  must  soothe  the  ultimate\njustice which is sought individually,  but  is  subservient  and  would  not\nprevail when fair trial requires transfer of the criminal proceedings.\nA wrongful act of an individual cannot derogate the right of fair  trial  as\nthat interest is closer, especially in criminal trials, to the Rule of  Law.\n An accused cannot be permitted to jettison the basic fundamentals of  trial\nin the name of fair trial.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_69\">The weighing of balance between the two perspectives in case of  fair  trial\nwould depend upon the facts  and  circumstances  weighed  on  the  scale  of\nconstitutional norms and sensibility and larger public interest.\n    <a href=\"/doc/1092263/\" id=\"a_355\">Section 3</a> of the 1950 Act does not create an impediment on the part  the\ncourt to pass an order of transfer of an accused or a convict from one  jail\nin a State to another prison in another State because it creates  a  bar  on\nthe exercise of power on the executive only.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_70\">The Court in exercise of power under <a href=\"/doc/500307/\" id=\"a_356\">Article 142</a> of the Constitution  cannot\ncurtail  the  fundamental  rights  of  the  citizens  conferred  under   the\nConstitution and pass orders in violation of  substantive  provisions  which\nare based on fundamental policy principles, yet when a case of  the  present\nnature arises, it may issue appropriate directions so  that  criminal  trial\nis conducted in accordance with law. It is the obligation and duty  of  this\nCourt to ensure free and fair trial.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_71\">The submission that this Court in  exercise  of  equity  jurisdiction  under\n<a href=\"/doc/500307/\" id=\"a_357\">Article 142</a> of the Constitution cannot transfer the accused from Siwan  Jail\nto any other jail in another State is unacceptable as the basic  premise  of\nthe said argument is erroneous, for  while  addressing  the  issue  of  fair\ntrial, the Court is not exercising any kind of jurisdiction in equity.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_76\">75.   In view of the aforesaid conclusions, we direct the State of Bihar  to\ntransfer the third respondent, M. Shahabuddin,  from  Siwan  Jail,  District\nSiwan to Tihar Jail, Delhi and hand  over  the  prisoner  to  the  competent\nofficer of Tihar Jail after giving prior  intimation  for  his  transfer  in\nDelhi.   Needless  to  say,  that  the  authorities  escorting   the   third\nrespondent from Siwan Jail to Tihar Jail would  strictly  follow  the  rules\napplicable to the transit  prisoners  and  no  special  privilege  shall  be\nextended.  The transfer shall take place within a  week  hence.  Thereafter,\nthe trial  in  respect  of  pending  trials  shall  be  conducted  by  video\nconferencing by the concerned trial court. The competent authority in  Tihar\nJail and the competent authority of  the  State  of  Bihar  shall  make  all\nessential arrangements so that  the  accused  and  the  witnesses  would  be\navailable for the purpose of trial through video conferencing.   A  copy  of\nthis  order  shall  forthwith  be  communicated  to  the   Home   Secretary,\nGovernment  of  Bihar,  Superintendent  of  Siwan  Jail  and  the  Inspector\nGeneral, Prisons, Tihar Jail, Delhi. All concerned are directed  to  act  in\naid of the  aforesaid  order  as  contemplated  under  <a href=\"/doc/1799967/\" id=\"a_358\">Article  144</a>  of  the\nConstitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_77\">76.
