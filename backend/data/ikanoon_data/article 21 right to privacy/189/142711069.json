In this connection, it is stated that we are not maintaining any\ndatabase which contains the list of all such e-mail correspondence with CICS/CIs.\nThus, in order to collate the information, there is need to get the name of the officers\nwho were then involved in the matter related to sharing of credit information and\nhave to filter their emails in order to compile the information as sought in the RTI\napplication. Accordingly, it would disproportionately divert the resources of the\npublic authority. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1519371\" id=\"span_4\">In this connection, a reference is invited to the judgment passedby\nthe Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in the matter of &quot;<a href=\"/doc/1519371/\" id=\"a_10\">Central Board of Secondary Education\n&amp; Anr. v.

Aggrieved with the FAA&#x27;s order, the Appellant approached the Commission with\nthe instant Second Appeal dated 15.02.2023.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_7\">5.

The appellant inter alia submitted that the exemptions invoked by the respondent\nwere not applicable to the information sought by him by any stretch of imagination. He\nfurther argued that the FAA did not find it appropriate to comply with the principles of\nnatural justice and to follow procedural laws that evolved upon good consensus while\ntaking up the first appeal as a quasi-judicial authority. The appellant further submitted\nthat the respondent had wrongly denied the information on hyper-technical grounds and\nnon-disclosure of information on the ground that the records such as inward/outward\nregisters contained names of individuals that could vitiate the principles of transparency\nand accountability that ought to be maintained by the public authorities.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_9\">7.    The respondent while defending their case inter alia submitted that they had\nprovided point-wise reply to the appellant vide letter dated 02.12.2022. Besides, they\nrelied upon their written submissions dated 26.02.2024 and the relevant extracts thereof\nare reproduced as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">      &quot;In the present second appeal, as regards query nos. 1 and 3, the appellant has\n      contended that he is aggrieved by the non-disclosure of information as exemptions\n      by no stretch of imagination could be evoked by the CPIO for denying the\n      information. He has again contended that the reply given by the CPIO as regards\n      query no. 2 is ambiguous. As regards the copy of letters provided in response to\n      query no. 4, the appellant has questioned the exemption claimed under <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_14\">section\n      8(1)(j)</a> of the RTI Act. Regarding query no. 5, the appellant has contended that\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                                                                 Page 5 of 9</span>\n complete report and other relevant material papers ought to have been provided\nby the CPIO. Further, the appellant has also claimed that he didn&#x27;t receive any\ninformation as per the order passed by the FAA within 10 working days from the\ndate of the order as directed by the FAA and the FAA had disposed- off the First\nAppeal without hearing the appellant in spite of a specific request for oral\nhearing.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_10\">8. It is humbly submitted that the order of the FAA was forwarded to the appellant\nvide letter dated February 07, 2023 wherein it was mentioned that the compliance\nas directed by the FAA would be provided in due course (copy enclosed and\nmarked as Annexure- &#x27;E&#x27;). Thereafter, vide letter dated February 20, 2023 (copy\nenclosed and marked as Annexure- &#x27;F&#x27;) the compliance of the order of the FAA\nwas also forwarded to the appellant as Annex to the said letter. In the final\ncompliance, as directed by the FAA, reasons for seeking exemption under <a href=\"/doc/1535548/\" id=\"a_15\">section\n8(1)(g)</a> &amp; (j) of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_16\">RTI Act</a> were given stating that inward and outward registers\ncontain details (names and full addresses) of the senders of the letters received\nand addressees of the letters sent and further the said registers contain details\n(names, designation and Employees IDs) of the employees involved in processing\nof the letters received (from the stage of inwarding till marking off from\nregister/portal). As regards query no 4, it was stated that all correspondence via\ne-mail between DoR, RBI &amp; four CICs and CIs regarding sharing of customer\ndata with CICs for publishing and sharing of CIBIL scored reports during the\nperiod between April 1, 2022 to November 30, 2022 is generic in nature and\ndatabase for this is not maintained which contains the list of all such e-mail\ncorrespondence with CICs/CIs. Thus, it was stated that in order to collate the\ninformation, there is need to get the name of the officers who were then involved in\nthe matter relating to sharing of credit information and then to filter their emails\nin order to compile the information as sought in the RTI application. Accordingly,\nit has been informed that the same would disproportionately divert the resources\nof the public authority. Further, these mails would also contain certain\ninformation exempted under <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_17\">section 8 (1)</a> of the RTI Act, 2005 and redaction of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                                                           Page 6 of 9</span>\n       such information would be a humongous process. The other contentions of the\n      appellant in the present appeal have been dealt with by the FAA in its order dated\n      January 24, 2023.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_11\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"127517806\" id=\"span_8\">8.    The Commission after adverting to the facts and circumstances of the case, hearing\nboth parties and perusal of records, observes that the respondent replied to the appellant\non 02.12.2022 and again on 20.02.2023, in compliance of the FAA&#x27;s order. The\nCommission agrees with the respondent that the information sought by the appellant\ncontained details (names and full addresses) of the senders of the letters received and\naddressees of the letters, details (names, designation and Employees IDs) of the\nemployees involved in processing of the letters received (from the stage of inwarding till\nmarking off from register/portal), details of customers in reports, etc. and seeking\nconsent of third parties concerned in each of those cases was a voluminous process.\nTherefore, the respondent was not under an obligation to filter out information and\nrecords in the manner sought by the appellant in the RTI application. Therefore, the\nexemption claimed by the respondent was found sustainable in the eyes of law. Further,\nthe Commission would like to draw the appellant&#x27;s attention towards the observations of\nthe Apex Court in respect of the conflict between right to information and right to\nprivacy, highlighted in the judgment dated 26 September, 2018 in <a href=\"/doc/127517806/\" id=\"a_18\">Justice K.S.\nPuttaswamy (Retd) vs Union Of India</a>, reproduced hereunder:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">      &quot;193. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"37517217\" id=\"span_9\">In <a href=\"/doc/37517217/\" id=\"a_19\">Thalappalam Service Cooperative Bank Limited v State of Kerala</a> 2013\n      (16) SCC 82 , this Court dealt with a conflict between the right to information\n      [(protected by <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_20\">Article 19(1)(a)]</a> and the right to privacy (protected by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_21\">Article 21</a>).</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\">      The Court observed:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">            &quot;61.
