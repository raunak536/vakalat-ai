It makes obtaining of Aadhaar card\n\n        compulsory for those persons who are income-tax assessees.\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 247 of 2017 &amp; Ors.                                   Page 3\n\f        Proviso to sub-section (2) of <a href=\"/doc/190513775/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 139AA</a> of the Act stipulates\n\n        the consequences of failure to intimate the Aadhaar number. In\n\n        those cases, PAN allotted to such persons would become invalid\n\n        not only from July 01, 2017, but from its inception as the deeming\n\n        provision in this proviso mentions that PAN would be invalid as if\n\n        the person had not applied for allotment of PAN, i.e. from the very\n\n        beginning.

Pursuant to the said Notification, the\n\n        Government of India appointed Shri Nandan Nilekhani, an\n\n        entrepreneur, as the Chairman of the UIDAI on July 02, 2009.\n\n        According to this scheme, every citizen of India is entitled to enrol\n\n        herself/himself with it and get a unique, randomnly selected 12\n\n        digit number.        For such enrolment, every person so intending\n\n        would have to provide his/her personal information along with\n\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 247 of 2017 &amp; Ors.

The\n\n        scheme was launched in September 2010 in the rural areas of\n\n        Maharashtra and thereafter extended all over India. One of the\n\n        objects of the entire project was non-duplication and elimination\n\n        of fake identity cards.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_16\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_17\">6)     On December 03, 2010, the National Identification Authority of\n\n        India Bill, 2010 was introduced in the Rajya Sabha.            On\n\n        December 13, 2011, the Standing Committee Report was\n\n        submitted to the Parliament stating that both the Bill and project\n\n        should be re-considered. The Parliamentary Standing Committee\n\n        on Finance rejected the Bill of 2010 as there was opposition to\n\n        the passing of the aforesaid Bill by the Parliament. Be that as it\n\n        may, the said Bill of 2010 did not get through. The result was that\n\n        as on that date, Aadhaar Scheme was not having any statutory\n\n        backing but was launched and continued to operate in exercise of\n\n        executive power of the Government.

At the same time,\n                    we are also of the opinion that the institutional integrity\n                    and judicial discipline require that pronouncement\n                    made by larger Benches of this Court cannot be\n                    ignored by the smaller Benches without appropriately\n                    explaining the reasons for not following the\n                    pronouncements made by such larger Benches.

It would be necessary to mention at\n\n       this stage that since challenge to the very concept of Aadhaar i.e.\n\n       unique identification number is predicated primarily on Right to\n\n       Privacy, when instant writ petitions were initially listed before us,\n\n       we suggested that these matters be also tagged along with Writ\n\n       Petition (C) No. 494 of 2012 and other matters which have been\n\n       referred to the Constitution Bench.          Pertinently, in the counter\n\n       affidavit filed on behalf of the Union of India also, plea has been\n\n       taken that the matters be tagged along with those pending writ\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 247 of 2017 &amp; Ors.                              Page 23\n\f       petitions and be decided by a larger Bench. On this suggestion,\n\n       reaction of the learned counsel for the petitioners was that\n\n       petitioners would not be pitching their case on the ‘Right to\n\n       Privacy’ and would be questioning the validity of <a href=\"/doc/1965344/\" id=\"a_43\">Section 139AA</a> of\n\n       the Act primarily on <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_44\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_45\">19</a> of the Constitution. On this\n\n       basis, their submission was that this Bench should proceed to\n\n       adjudicate the matter. Therefore, we make it clear at the outset\n\n       that we are not touching upon the privacy issue while determining\n\n       the question of validity of the impugned provision of the Act.\n\n\nThe Arguments\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_56\">20)    Mr. Datar, learned senior counsel who opened the attack on\n\n       behalf of the petitioners, started by stating the historical fact\n\n       pertaining to introduction of Aadhaar Scheme, leading to the\n\n       passing of Aadhaar Act and thereafter the impugned provision\n\n       and referring to the various orders passed by this Court from time\n\n       to time (which have already been reproduced above). After this\n\n       narration, his first submission was that this Court had, time and\n\n       again, emphasised by various interim orders that obtaining an\n\n       Aadhaar Card would be a voluntarily act on behalf of a citizen and\n\n       it would not be made mandatory till the pendency of the petitions\n\n       which stand referred to the Constitution Bench now. He further\n\n\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 247 of 2017 &amp; Ors.                            Page 24\n\f       submitted that even Section 3 of the Aadhaar Act spells out that\n\n       enrollment of Aadhaar is voluntarily and consensual and not\n\n       compulsory or by way of executive action.        He also drew our\n\n       attention to the proviso to Section 7 of the Aadhaar Act as per\n\n       which a person is not to be deprived of subsidies as per the\n\n       various schemes of the Government as the said proviso clearly\n\n       mentions that if an Aadhaar Number is not assigned to an\n\n       individual, he shall be offered alternate and viable means of\n\n       identification for delivery of subsidy, benefit or service. According\n\n       to him, there was a total reversal of the aforesaid approach for\n\n       assessees under the <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_46\">Income Tax Act</a> and those who wanted to\n\n       apply for issuance of PAN Card inasmuch as not only it was made\n\n       compulsory for them to get Aadhaar enrollment number, but\n\n       serious consequences were also provided for not adhering to this\n\n       requirement. In their cases, PAN issued to these assessees had\n\n       to become invalid, that too from the retrospective effect i.e. from\n\n       the date when it is issued. Having regard to the aforesaid, the\n\n       legal submission of Mr. Datar was that Section 139AA was\n\n       unconstitutional and without legislative competence inasmuch as\n\n       this provision was enacted contrary to the binding nature of the\n\n       judgments/directions of this Court which was categorical that\n\n       Aadhaar had to remain voluntary.        Questioning the legislative\n\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 247 of 2017 &amp; Ors.                         Page 25\n\f       competence of the legislature to enact this particular law,\n\n       argument of Mr. Datar was that there were certain implied\n\n       limitations of such a legislative competence and one of these\n\n       limitations was that legislature was debarred from enacting a law\n\n       contrary to the binding nature of decisions of this Court.               His\n\n       submission in this behalf was that though it was within the\n\n       competence of the legislature to remove the basis of the\n\n       Supreme Court decision, at the same time, legislature could not\n\n       go against the decision which was law of the land under <a href=\"/doc/882644/\" id=\"a_47\">Article\n\n       141</a> of the Constitution.                He argued that, in the instant case,\n\n       legislature could not be construed as removing the basis of the\n\n       various orders of this Court relating to Aadhaar Scheme itself but\n\n       the impugned provision was inserted in the statute book violating\n\n       the binding nature of those orders.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_57\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_58\">21)    Dilating on the aforesaid submissions, Mr. Datar argued that the\n\n       earlier orders of this Court dated August 23, 2015 of the main writ\n\n       petition specifically permitted Aadhaar to be used only for LPG\n\n       and PDS. By an order dated October 15, 2015, at the request of\n\n       the Union of India, it was permitted to be extended to three other\n\n       schemes, namely, MNREGA, Jan Dhan Yojana etc.                           The\n\n       Constitution Bench made it explicitly clear that the Aadhaar\n\n\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 247 of 2017 &amp; Ors.                                 Page 26\n\f       scheme could not be used for any other purpose. According to\n\n       him, the Parliament did not in any manner remove the basis of\n\n       these decisions. The Aadhaar scheme, as enacted under the\n\n       Aadhaar Act, continued to retain its voluntary character (as\n\n       demonstrated by <a href=\"/doc/1869099/\" id=\"a_48\">Section 3</a> of that Act) that existed when Aadhaar\n\n       was operating under executive instructions. Nonetheless, even if\n\n       it is argued that the above orders were passed when Aadhaar\n\n       was based on executive instructions, decisions of this Court\n\n       continue to be binding as they are made in exercise of the judicial\n\n       power. According to Mr. Datar, any judgment of a court, whether\n\n       interim or final, whether rendered in the context of a legislation,\n\n       delegated legislation (rules/notifications) or even executive action\n\n       will continue to be binding. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1446086\" id=\"span_12\">In view of the judgment of this Court\n\n       in <a href=\"/doc/1446086/\" id=\"a_49\">Ram Jawaya Kapoor v.

This alone renders Section 139AA\n\n               unconstitutional.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_65\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_66\">24)    Arguing that basis of the orders of this Court was not removed,\n\n       plea of Mr. Datar was that the basis of the said orders was that\n\n       serious constitutional concerns had been raised about the\n\n       Aadhaar scheme, and that therefore, pending final decision on its\n\n       validity by the Supreme Court, it ought to remain voluntary.\n\n       Consequently, in order to remove the basis of these orders, the\n\n       Parliament would have to pass a law overturning the voluntary\n\n       character of Aadhaar itself.            Notably, although Parliament did\n\n       have a chance to do so, it elected not to. The Aadhaar Act came\n\n       into force on March 25, 2016. This was after the order of this\n\n       Court.        Significantly, however, the Parliament continued to\n\n       maintain Aadhaar as a voluntary scheme vide <a href=\"/doc/1869099/\" id=\"a_53\">Section 3</a> of the\n\n       said Act. Mr. Datar submitted that if Parliament so desired, it\n\n       could have removed the basis of this Court’s order by:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_75\">        (i)    Amending Section 3 so that Aadhaar is made compulsory\n\n               for every resident of India; or\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_76\">        (ii)   Introducing either a proviso or adding a sub-section in\n\n               <a href=\"/doc/1869099/\" id=\"a_54\">Section 3</a> to the following effect:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_77\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 247 of 2017 &amp; Ors.                             Page 29\n\f                    “Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section\n                    (1), the Central Government may notify specific\n                    purposes for which obtaining Aadhaar numbers may\n                    be made mandatory in public interest.”\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_78\">25)    However, Parliament elected not to do so as there is no\n\n       non-obstante clause. Instead of making enrollment for Aadhaar\n\n       itself mandatory, it made Aadhaar mandatory for filing income-tax\n\n       returns, even as enrollment itself remained voluntary under\n\n       Section 3 of the Aadhaar Act. He, thus, submitted that far from\n\n       taking away the basis of the earlier Supreme Court orders. The\n\n       Aadhaar Act strengthened and endorsed those orders, while\n\n       Section 139AA impermissibly attempted to overturn them without\n\n       taking away their basis. Indeed, Parliament did not even sof ar\n\n       as include a non-obstante clause in Section 139AA, which would\n\n       have made it clear that Section would override contrary laws –\n\n       clearly indicating once again that Section 13AA was not taking\n\n       away the basis of the Court’s orders. The emphasis of Mr. Datar\n\n       is that unless suitable/appropriate amendments are made to the\n\n       Aadhaar Act, the orders of the Court cannot be overruled by the\n\n       newly inserted Section 139AA.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_79\">26)    On the aforesaid edifice, the argument built and developed by Mr.\n\n       Datar is that although the power of Parliament to pass laws with\n\n       respect to List-I and List-III is plenary, it is subject to two implied\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 247 of 2017 &amp; Ors.                           Page 30\n\f       limitations:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_80\">       (i)     Parliament or any State legislature cannot pass any law that\n\n               overrules a judgment; before any law is passed which may\n\n               result in nullifying a decision, it is mandatory to remove the\n\n               basis of the decision. Once the basis on which the earlier\n\n               decision/order/judgment is delivered is removed, Parliament\n\n               can then pass a law prospectively or retrospectively and\n\n               with or without a validation clause.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_81\">       (ii)    Implied limitation not to pass contrary laws: The doctrine of\n\n               harmonious          construction   applies   when   there   is   an\n\n               accidental collision or conflict between two enactments and\n\n               the Supreme Court has repeatedly read down one provision\n\n               to give effect to other. Thus, both the provisions have to be\n\n               given effect to. But if the collision or conflict is such that\n\n               one provision cannot co-exist with another, then the latter\n\n               provision must be struck down.               In the present case,\n\n               obtaining an Aadhaar number continues to be voluntary and\n\n               explicitly declared to be so.         Once the Aadhaar Card is\n\n               voluntary, it cannot be made mandatory by the impugned\n\n               <a href=\"/doc/1965344/\" id=\"a_55\">Section 139AA</a> of the Act.             As long as the Aadhaar\n\n               enactment holds the field, there is an implied limitation on\n\n               the power of Parliament not to pass a contrary law.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_82\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 247 of 2017 &amp; Ors.                               Page 31\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_83\">\f27)    He also advanced two examples of such an implied limitation:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_84\">        (i)    If Parliament, by a statute, makes medical service in rural\n\n               areas an attractive option for doctors with incentives like\n\n               preference          for         post-graduate   admissions,   higher\n\n               pay/allowances, or even lower tax, such a scheme is\n\n               voluntary and only those doctors who want those benefits\n\n               may opt for it. While such a statute exists, it will not be\n\n               permissible for Parliament to simultaneously amend the\n\n               <a href=\"/doc/118783942/\" id=\"a_56\">Medical Council Act, 1956</a> and state that absence of rural\n\n               service will be a ground to invalidate the doctor’s certificate\n\n               of practice. Thus, what is statutorily voluntary under one\n\n               Parliamentary Act cannot be made statutorily compulsory\n\n               under another Parliamentary Act at the same time.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_85\">        (ii)   Second example given by Mr. Datar was that making\n\n               Aadhaar compulsory only for individuals with severe\n\n               consequences of cancellation of PAN cards and a deeming\n\n               provision that they had never applied for PAN is\n\n               discriminatory when such a provision is not made\n\n               mandatory for other assessees.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_86\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"685234\" id=\"span_16\">28)    Mr. Datar’s next plea of violation of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_57\">Article 14</a> was based by him\n\n        on the application of the twin-test of classification viz. there\n\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 247 of 2017 &amp; Ors.

Dalmia v. Justice S.R. Tendolkar6</a>. Mr.\n\n        Datar conceded that first test was met as individual assessees\n\n        form a separate class and, to this extent, there is a rational\n\n        differentiation between individuals and other categories of\n\n        assessees.        The main brunt of his argument was on the second\n\n        limb of the twin-test of classification which according to him is not\n\n        satisfied because there is no rational nexus with the object sought\n\n        to be achieved.</span>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_87\">29)    Third argument of Mr. Datar was that the affected persons by\n\n       Section 139AA are individuals who are professionals like lawyers,\n\n       doctors, architects etc. and lakhs of businessmen having small or\n\n       micro enterprises. By imposing a draconian penalty of cancelling\n\n       their PAN cards and deeming that they had never applied for\n\n       them, there is a direct infringement to <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_59\">Article 19(1)(g).</a>        The\n\n       consequences of not having a PAN card results in a virtual “civil\n\n       death” and it will be impossible to carry out any business or\n\n       professional activity under Rule 114B of the Income Tax Rules,\n\n       1962 (hereinafter referred to as the ‘Rules’), it will not be possible\n\n       to operate bank accounts with transactions above Rs.50,000/-,\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_67\">6   (1959) SCR 279\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 247 of 2017 &amp; Ors.

However, in his endeavour to plead that the\n\n        provision be declared unconstitutional, he approached the subject\n\n        from an altogether different premise, giving another perception to\n\n        the whole issue. His basic submission was that every individual\n\n        or citizen in this country had complete control over his/her body\n\n        and State cannot insist any person from giving his/her finger tips\n\n        or iris of eyes, as a condition precedent to enjoy certain rights.\n\n        He pointed out that all the petitioners in his writ petition were\n\n        holding PAN Cards and were income-tax assessees but had not\n\n        enrolled under Aadhaar Scheme.                 They were the consentions\n\n        persons in the society and did not want to give away their finger\n\n        tips or iris, being consentions objectors, that too, to private\n\n        persons who were engaged as contractors/private enrollers by\n\n        the Government for undertaking the job of enrolment under the\n\n        Aadhaar. It was submitted that the data given to such persons\n\n        were not safe and there was huge possibility that the same may\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 247 of 2017 &amp; Ors.                               Page 36\n\f        be leaked. Further, requirement of giving Aadhaar number for\n\n        every transaction amounted to surveillance by the State and the\n\n        entire profile of such persons would be available to the State. He\n\n        also pointed out that with today’s technology, there was every\n\n        possibility of copying the fingerprint and even the iris images.\n\n        Various cases of fake Aadhaar Card had come to light and even\n\n        as per the Government’s statement, 3.48 lakh bogus Aadhaar\n\n        Cards were cancelled. There were instances of Aadhaar leak as\n\n        well. Even hacking was possible. He conceded that these were\n\n        the issues within the realm of ‘Right to Privacy’ which were to be\n\n        decided by the Constitution Bench. However, according to him,\n\n        various orders passed by this Court in those petitions clearly\n\n        reflect that the Court had given the directions that Aadhaar\n\n        Scheme had to be voluntarily; there would not be any illegal\n\n        implants; and no one would suffer any consequences if he does\n\n        not enroll himself under the Aadhaar Scheme. He also submitted\n\n        that even the Aadhaar Act was voluntary in nature which creates\n\n        rights for citizens and not obligations. According to him, Aadhaar\n\n        Act envisages free consent for getting certain benefits under\n\n        social welfare schemes of the Government. On the other hand,\n\n        <a href=\"/doc/1965344/\" id=\"a_68\">Section 139AA</a> of the Act is compulsory and coercive.

Though a sovereign country, its\n\n        governance is controlled by the provisions of the Constitution\n\n        which sets parameters within which three wings of the State,\n\n        namely, Legislature, Executive and Judiciary has to function.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_75\">        Thus, no wing of the State can breach the limitations provided in\n\n        the Constitution which employs an array of checks and balances\n\n        to ensure open, accountable government where each wing of the\n\n        State performs its actions for the benefit of the people and within\n\n        its sphere of responsibility. The checks and balances are many\n\n        and amongst them are the respective roles assigned by the\n\n        Constitution to the legislature, the executive and the judiciary.\n\n        Under India’s federal structure, with a distribution of legislative\n\n        authority between the Union government and the States, the\n\n        fields of legislation and corresponding executive authority are\n\n        also distributed between the Union and the States. Provisions in\n\n        the Constitution such as the fundamental rights chapter (Part III)\n\n        and the chapter relating to inter-state trade (Part XIII) also\n\n\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 247 of 2017 &amp; Ors.                            Page 39\n\f        circumscribe the authority of the State. These limitations on the\n\n        power of the State support the notion of ‘limited government’. In\n\n        this sense, the expression ‘limited government’ would mean that\n\n        each wing of the State is restricted by provisions of the\n\n        Constitution and other laws and is required to operate within its\n\n        legitimate sphere. Exceeding these limits would render the action\n\n        of the State ultra vires the Constitution or a particular law.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_76\">               <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"766560\" id=\"span_20\">He further argued that the concept of ‘limited government’\n\n        may also be understood in a much broader and different sense.\n\n        This notion of a limited government is qua the citizenry as a\n\n        whole. There are certain things that the State simply cannot do,\n\n        because the action fundamentally alters the relationship between\n\n        the citizens and the State. The wholesale collection of biometric\n\n        data including finger prints and storing it at a central depository\n\n        per se puts the State in an extremely dominant position in relation\n\n        to the individual citizen. Biometric data belongs to the concerned\n\n        individual and the State cannot collect or retain it to be used\n\n        against the individual or to his or her prejudice in the future.\n\n        Further the State cannot put itself in a position where it can track\n\n        an individual and engage in surveillance.         The State cannot\n\n        deprive or withhold the enjoyment of rights and entitlements by an\n\n        individual or makes such entitlements conditional on a citizen\n\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 247 of 2017 &amp; Ors.

The Indian Constitution does not establish a totalitarian\n\n        State but creates a State that is respectful of individual liberty and\n\n        constitutionally guaranteed freedoms. The Constitution of India is\n\n        not a charter of servitude.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_102\">37)    Proceeding further, another submission of Mr. Divan, as noted\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 247 of 2017 &amp; Ors.                                 Page 42\n\f        above, was that <a href=\"/doc/190513775/\" id=\"a_83\">Section 139AA</a> which coerces the individuals to\n\n        part with their personal information was unconstitutional.       He\n\n        submitted that a citizen is entitled to enjoy all these rights\n\n        including social and civil rights such as the right to receive an\n\n        education, a scholarship, medical assistance, pensions and\n\n        benefits under government schemes without having to part with\n\n        his or her personal biometrics. An individual’s biometrics such as\n\n        finger prints and iris scan are the property and entitlement of that\n\n        individual and the State cannot coerce an individual or direct him\n\n        or her to part with biometrics as a condition for the exercise of\n\n        rights or the enjoyment of entitlements. Every citizen has a basic\n\n        right to informational self-determination and the state cannot\n\n        exercise dominion over a citizen’s proprietary information either in\n\n        individual cases or collectively so as to place itself in a position\n\n        where it can aggregate information and create detailed profiles of\n\n        individuals or facilitate this process. The Constitution of India is\n\n        not a charter for a Police State which permits the State to\n\n        maintain cradle to grave records of the citizenry. No democratic\n\n        country in the world has devised a system similar to Aadhaar\n\n        which operates like an electronic leash to tether every citizen\n\n        from cradle to grave. There can be no question of free consent in\n\n        situations where an individual is being coerced to part with its\n\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 247 of 2017 &amp; Ors.

In\n\n        other words, the State cannot compel a person to part with\n\n        biometrics as a condition precedent for discharge of the State’s\n\n        constitutional and statutory obligations.            In support of his\n\n        submission that there cannot be coercive measures on the part of\n\n        the Government to part with such information and it has to be\n\n        voluntary and based on informed consent, Mr. Divan refered to\n\n        the following judgments:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_103\">        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"195593310\" id=\"span_21\">(<a href=\"/doc/195593310/\" id=\"a_84\">i)      National Legal Services Authority v.

Every human being of adult years and sound\n                    mind has a right to determine what shall be done with\n                    his own body. In the case of medical treatment, for\n                    example, a surgeon who performs an operation\n                    without the patient&#x27;s consent commits assault or\n                    battery. It follows as a corollary that the patient\n                    possesses the right not to consent i.e. to refuse\n                    treatment.

One of the purposes of Aadhaar as projected by the\n\n        respondents is that it will be a single point verification for KYC\n\n        (Know Your Customer).                  This is permissible and indeed\n\n        contemplated by the impugned Act. Given the very poor quality\n\n        of scrutiny of documents by private enrollers and enrollment\n\n        agencies (without any governmental supervision) means that the\n\n        more rigorous KYC process at present being employed by banks\n\n        and other financial institutions will yield to a system which\n\n        depends on a much weaker data base. This would eventually\n\n        imperil the integrity of the financial system and also threaten the\n\n        economic sovereignty of the nation. According to him, Aadhaar\n\n        Act does not serve as an identity as incorrectly projected by the\n\n        respondents but serves as a method of identification.           Every\n\n        citizen-state and citizen-service provider interaction requiring\n\n        identification is sought to be captured and retained by the\n\n        government at a central base and a whole ecology developed\n\n        that would require reference to this central data base on multiple\n\n        occasions in course of the day.

He submitted that although dignity inevitably includes\n\n        privacy, the former has several other dimensions which need to\n\n        be explored as well.                In his submissions, the test to identify\n\n        whether certain data collected about individuals is intrusive or\n\n        merely       expansive         is      to   consider   whether   it   causes\n\n        embarrassment, indignity or invasion of privacy.                  Thus, the\n\n        concept of dignity is quite distinct from that of privacy. Privacy is\n\n        a conditional concept. One has it only to the extent that one’s\n\n        circumstances allow for it, as a matter of fact and law. While it is\n\n        widely accepted that a situation may occur where a person may\n\n        not have any Right to Privacy whatsoever, dignity is an inherent\n\n        possession of every person, regardless of circumstance. In that\n\n        sense, Dignity is an inherent dimension of equality, the basis of\n\n        John Rawls ‘Theory of Justice’.                 The Social Contract theory\n\n        propounded by Rousseau remains the ground on which John\n\n        Rawls developed the model of the Original Position in which the\n\n        contours of the compact are conceived. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"102852\" id=\"span_28\">Anything that reduces\n\n        the personality of the participant, such as diluting the human\n\n        element and substituting it with a number or biometric data,\n\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 247 of 2017 &amp; Ors.

No court has ever held that a person can be stripped\n\n        entirely of hir/her dignity.

No exact definition of human\n                    dignity exists. It refers to the intrinsic value of every\n                    human being, which is to be respected.

The constitutional courts in Germany,\n                    therefore, see human dignity as a fundamental\n                    principle within the system of the basic rights.

He submitted\n\n        that Right to Life and Liberty mentioned in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_109\">Article 21</a> of the\n\n        Constitution encompasses within its right to live with dignity as\n\n        has been held in catena of cases by this Court. He explained in\n\n        detail as to how the concept of dignity was dealt with by different\n\n        jurists from time to time including Kant who identified dignity with\n\n        autonomy and Dworkin who exemplified the doctrine of dignity on\n\n        the conception of living well, which itself is based on two\n\n        principles of dignity, namely, self respect and authenticity. In this\n\n        sense, he submitted that living with dignity involves giving\n\n        importance to living our life well and acting independently from\n\n        the personal sense of character and commitment to standards\n\n        and ideals we stand for. The mandatory requirement of Aadhaar\n\n        card makes an unwarranted intrusion in the importance we give\n\n        to our bodily integrity in living our life well and compels human\n\n        beings to express themselves the way the State wants. He also\n\n        submitted that the features relevant for upholding the dignity of a\n\n        human being will be severely compromised with when the data\n\n        are cross-referenced with data relating to other spheres of life\n\n        and are disclosed to third parties through different data collected\n\n        for varied reasons. This would take place without the knowledge\n\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 247 of 2017 &amp; Ors.

Mr.\n\n        Khurshid also submitted that there was no compelling state\n\n        interests in having such a provision introducing compulsive\n\n        element and depriving from erstwhile voluntary nature of Aadhaar\n\n        scheme. According to him, the ‘proportionality of means’ concept\n\n        is an essential one since integrating data beyond what is really\n\n        necessary for the stated purpose is clearly unconstitutional. He\n\n        submitted that in light of the decision in the case of <a href=\"/doc/845196/\" id=\"a_110\">Gobind v.\n\n        State of Madhya Pradesh16</a>, which has been the position of this\n\n        Court since the past forty-two years and has been cited with\n\n        approval often, it is humbly submitted that the State has the\n\n        onerous burden of justifying the impugned mandatory provision.</span>\n\n        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"845216\" id=\"span_30\">The ‘compelling state interest’ justification is only one aspect of\n\n16     (1975) 2 SCC 148\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 247 of 2017 &amp; Ors.

The other essential\n\n        facet is to demonstrate ‘narrow tailoring’, i.e., that the State must\n\n        demonstrate that even if a compelling interest exists, it has\n\n        adopted a method that will infringe in the narrowest possible\n\n        manner upon individual rights. He submitted that neither is there\n\n        any compelling State interest warranting such a harsh mandatory\n\n        provision, nor has it been narrowly tailored to meet the object, if\n\n        any.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_97\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_98\">47)    In this hue, he also submitted that <a href=\"/doc/190513775/\" id=\"a_112\">Section 139AA</a> of the Act\n\n        violates the Rule of Law. Elaborating his argument, he submitted\n\n        that a legal system which in general observes the rule of law\n\n        treats its people as persons, in the sense that it attempts to guide\n\n        their behaviour through affecting the circumstances of their\n\n        action. It, thus, presupposes that they are rational autonomous\n\n        creatures and attempts to affect their actions and habits by\n\n        affecting their deliberations.         It satisfies men’s craving for\n\n        reasonable certainty of form as well as substance, and for dignity\n\n        of process as well as dignity of result. On the other hand, when\n\n        the rule of law is violated, it may be either in the form of leading to\n\n        uncertainty or it may lead to frustrated and disappointed\n\n17     (2008) 3 SCC 1\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 247 of 2017 &amp; Ors.                            Page 57\n\f        expectations. It leads to the first when the law does not enable\n\n        people to foresee future developments or to form definite\n\n        expectations.         It leads to frustrated expectations when the\n\n        appearance of stability and certainty which encourages people to\n\n        rely and plan on the basis of the existing law is shattered by\n\n        retroactive law-making or by preventing proper law-enforcement,\n\n        etc. The evils of frustrated expectations are greater. Quite apart\n\n        from the concrete harm they cause they also offend dignity in\n\n        expressing disrespect for people’s autonomy. The law in such\n\n        cases encourages autonomous action only in order to frustrate its\n\n        purpose. When such frustration is the result of human action or\n\n        the result of the activities of social institutions then it expresses\n\n        disrespect.         Often it is analogous to entrapment: one is\n\n        encouraged innocently to rely on the law and then that assurance\n\n        is withdrawn and one’s very reliance is turned into a cause of\n\n        harm to one. Just as in the instant case, the impugned provision\n\n        came into force when the order of the Court that Aadhaar card is\n\n        not mandatory, still continues to operate.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_99\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_100\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"338690\" id=\"span_31\">48)    In the alternative, another submission of Mr. Khurshid was that\n\n        <a href=\"/doc/190513775/\" id=\"a_113\">Section 139AA</a> was retrospective in nature as per proviso to\n\n        sub-section (2) thereof. As per the said proviso, on failure to give\n\n\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 247 of 2017 &amp; Ors.                          Page 58\n\f        Aadhaar number, the consequence was not only to render the\n\n        PAN Card invalid prospectively but from the initial date of\n\n        issuance of PAN Card in view of the expression ‘as if the person\n\n        had not applied for Permanent Account Number’ which would\n\n        meant that PAN Card would be invalidated by rendering the same\n\n        void ab initio i.e. from retrospective effect. Such a retrospective\n\n        effect, according to him, was violative of <a href=\"/doc/1501707/\" id=\"a_114\">Article 20(1)</a> of the\n\n        Constitution. Further, retrospective operation is not permissible\n\n        without separate objects for such operations as held in <a href=\"/doc/338690/\" id=\"a_115\">Dayawati\n\n        v. Inderjit18</a>. In conclusion, learned senior counsel submitted that\n\n        the law regarding mandatory requirement of Aadhaar card is a\n\n        hasty piece of legislation without much thought going into it. It is\n\n        submitted that the Aadhaar card cannot be made mandatory for\n\n        filing tax returns with such far-reaching consequences for\n\n        non-compliance, unless and until suitable measures are put in\n\n        place to ensure that the dignity of the assessees is not\n\n        compromised with.                The generalisation, centralisation and\n\n        disclosure of biometric information, however, accidental it might\n\n        be, has to be effectively controlled and mechanisms have to be\n\n        put in place to inquire and penalise those found guilty of\n\n        disclosing such information.           The need to do so is extremely\n\n\n18     (1966) 3 SCR 275\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 247 of 2017 &amp; Ors.                             Page 59\n\f        crucial in view of the fact that biometric systems may be\n\n        bypassed, hacked, or even fail. Unless the same is done, the\n\n        identity of the citizens will be reduced to a collection of\n\n        instrumentalised markers.              Further, the organisations and\n\n        authorities allowed to conduct it should be strictly defined. There\n\n        has to be a strict control over any systematic use of common\n\n        identifiers. No such re-grouping of data can be allowed as could\n\n        lead to the use of biometrics for exclusion of vulnerable groups.\n\n        Brown considers surveillance as both a discursive and a material\n\n        practice that reifies bodies around divisive lines. Surveillance of\n\n        certain communities has been both social as well as political\n\n        norm. He further submitted that this Court cannot lose sight of\n\n        the fact that the data collected under the impugned provision may\n\n        be used to carry out discriminatory research and sort subjects\n\n        into groups for specific reasons.          The fact that the impugned\n\n        provision creates an apprehension in the minds of the people,\n\n        legitimate and reasonable enough with no preventive mechanism\n\n        in place, is in itself a violation of the right to life and personal\n\n        liberty as enshrined under the Constitution.</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_101\">49)    Mr. Anando Mukherjee, learned counsel, appeared in Writ Petition\n\n        (Civil) No. 304 of 2017, while reiterating the submissions of earlier\n\n\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 247 of 2017 &amp; Ors.

On behalf of the State both Mr. Trivedi and Mr.\n                    Yogeshwar Prasad contended that regulatory power of\n                    the State was there and in order to regulate it was\n                    possible to impose certain disincentives in the form of\n                    fees or levies. Imposition of these imposts as part of\n                    regulatory process is permissible, it was submitted.\n                    Our attention was drawn to the various decisions\n                    where by virtue of “police power” in respect of alcohol\n                    the State has imposed such impositions. Though one\n                    would not be justified in adverting to any police power,\n                    it is possible to conceive sovereign power and on that\n                    sovereign power to have the power of regulation to\n                    impose such conditions so as to ensure that the\n                    regulations are obeyed and complied with. We would\n                    not like, however, to embark upon any theory of police\n                    power because the Indian Constitution does not\n                    recognise police power as such. But we must\n                    recognise the exercise of sovereign power which gives\n                    the States sufficient authority to enact any law subject\n                    to the limitations of the Constitution to discharge its\n                    functions. Hence, the Indian Constitution as a\n                    sovereign State has power to legislate on all branches\n                    except to the limitation as to the division of powers\n                    between the Centre and the States and also subject to\n                    the fundamental rights guaranteed under the\n                    Constitution. The Indian State, between the Centre\n                    and the States, has sovereign power. The sovereign\n                    power is plenary and inherent in every sovereign State\n                    to do all things which promote the health, peace,\n                    morals, education and good order of the people.\n                    Sovereignty is difficult to define. This power of\n                    sovereignty is, however, subject to constitutional\n                    limitations. This power, according to some\n26     (1990) 1 SCC 109\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 247 of 2017 &amp; Ors.

Secondly, in any case, those orders were passed at a\n\n        time when Aadhaar was being implemented as a scheme in\n\n        administrative/executive domain and the Court was considering\n\n        the validity of Aadhaar scheme in that hue/background. Those\n\n        orders have not been passed in the context of examining the\n\n        validity of any legislative measure. Thirdly, no final view is taken\n\n        in the form of any judgment that Aadhaar is unconstitutional and,\n\n        therefore, there is no basis in existence which was required to be\n\n        removed. Fourthly, the Parliament was competent to pass the\n\n        law and provide statutory framework to give legislative backing to\n\n        Aadhaar in the absence of any such law which existed at that\n\n        time. He, thus, submitted that there was no question of curing the\n\n        alleged basis of judgment/interim orders by legislation.           He\n\n        specifically relied upon the following passage from the judgment\n\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 247 of 2017 &amp; Ors.

The principles on which first question would\n                    require to be answered are not in doubt. The power to\n                    invalidate a legislative or executive act lies with the\n                    Court. A judicial pronouncement, either declaratory or\n                    conferring rights on the citizens cannot be set at\n                    naught by a subsequent legislative act for that would\n                    amount to an encroachment on the judicial powers.\n                    However, the legislature would be competent to pass\n                    an amending or a validating act, if deemed fit, with\n                    retrospective effect removing the basis of the decision\n                    of the Court. Even in such a situation the courts may\n                    not approve a retrospective deprivation of accrued\n                    rights arising from a judgment by means of a\n                    subsequent          legislation     (<a href=\"/doc/55098/\" id=\"a_137\">Madan         Mohan\n                    Pathak v.

However, where the Court&#x27;s\n                    judgment is purely declaratory, the courts will lean in\n                    support of the legislative power to remove the basis of\n                    a court judgment even retrospectively, paving the way\n                    for a restoration of the status quo ante. Though the\n                    consequence may appear to be an exercise to\n                    overcome the judicial pronouncement it is so only at\n                    first blush; a closer scrutiny would confer legitimacy on\n                    such an exercise as the same is a normal adjunct of\n                    the legislative power.

This is for\n                    the reason that once a matter becomes a matter of\n                    public record, the right to privacy no longer subsists\n                    and it becomes a legitimate subject for comment by\n                    press and media among others.

In the case of public officials, it is\n                    obvious, right to privacy, or for that matter, the remedy\n                    of action for damages is simply not available with\n                    respect to their acts and conduct relevant to the\n                    discharge of their official duties. This is so even where\n                    the publication is based upon facts and statements\n                    which are not true, unless the official establishes that\n                    the publication was made (by the defendant) with\n                    reckless disregard for truth. In such a case, it would be\n                    enough for the defendant (member of the press or\n                    media) to prove that he acted after a reasonable\n                    verification of the facts; it is not necessary for him to\n                    prove that what he has written is true.

Undoubtedly, the issue that confronts us is of seminal\n\n        importance.          In recent times, issues about the proprietary,\n\n        significance, merits and demerits have generated lots of debate\n\n        among intelligentia. The Government claims that this provision is\n\n        introduced in the Statute to achieve laudable objectives and it is\n\n        in public interest. It is felt that this technology can solve many\n\n        development challenges. The petitioners argue that the move is\n\n        impermissible as it violates their fundamental rights. It falls in the\n\n        category       of,    what      Ronald   Dworkin   calls,   “hard   cases”.\n\n        Nevertheless, the duty of the court is to decide such cases as\n\n        well and give better decision. While undertaking this exercise of\n\n        judicial review, let us first keep in mind the width and extent of\n\n        power of judicial review of a legislative action. The Court cannot\n\n        question the wisdom of the Legislature in enacting a particular\n\n        law. It is required to act within the domain available to it.\n\n\nScope of Judicial Review of Legislative Act\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_154\">73)    Under the Constitution, Supreme Court as well as High Courts\n\n        are vested with the power of judicial review of not only\n\n        administrative acts of the executive but legislative enactments\n\n\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 247 of 2017 &amp; Ors.                                Page 87\n\f        passed by the legislature as well. This power is given to the High\n\n        Courts under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_172\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution and to the Supreme\n\n        Court under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_173\">Article 32</a> as well as <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_174\">Article 136</a> of the Constitution.\n\n        At the same time, the parameters on which the power of judicial\n\n        review of administrative act is to be undertaken are different from\n\n        the parameters on which validity of legislative enactment is to be\n\n        examined. No doubt, in exercises of its power of judicial review\n\n        of legislative action, the Supreme Court, or for that matter, the\n\n        High Courts can declare law passed by the Parliament or the\n\n        State Legislature as invalid. However, the power to strike down\n\n        primary legislation enacted by the Union or the State Legislatures\n\n        is on limited grounds. Courts can strike down legislation either on\n\n        the basis that it falls foul of federal distribution of powers or that it\n\n        contravenes          fundamental       rights   or   other   Constitutional\n\n        rights/provisions of the Constitution of India. No doubt, since the\n\n        Supreme Court and the High Courts are treated as the ‘ultimate\n\n        arbiter in all matters involving interpretation of the Constitution, it\n\n        is the Courts which have the final say on questions relating to\n\n        rights and whether such a right is violated or not. The basis of\n\n        the aforesaid statement lies in <a href=\"/doc/772605/\" id=\"a_175\">Article 13(2)</a> of the Constitution\n\n        which proscribes the State from making ‘any law which takes\n\n        away or abridges the right conferred by Part III’, enshrining\n\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 247 of 2017 &amp; Ors.

A legislation passed by Parliament can be\n                    challenged only on constitutionally recognised\n                    grounds. Ordinarily, grounds of attack of a legislation\n                    is whether the legislature has legislative competence\n                    or whether the legislation is ultra vires the provisions\n                    of the Constitution. If any of the provisions of the\n                    legislation violates fundamental rights or any other\n                    provisions of the Constitution, it could certainly be a\n                    valid ground to set aside the legislation by invoking the\n                    power of judicial review.

In this\n                    connection, it should be remembered that even in the\n                    case of administrative action, the scope of judicial\n                    review is limited to three grounds, viz., (i)\n                    unreasonableness, which can more appropriately be\n                    called irrationality, (ii) illegality and (iii) procedural\n                    impropriety (see Council of Civil Service Unions v.\n                    Minister for Civil Service [1985 AC 374 : (1984) 3 All\n                    ER 935 : (1984) 3 WLR 1174] which decision has\n                    been accepted by this Court as well). The applicability\n                    of doctrine of proportionality even in administrative law\n                    sphere is yet a debatable issue. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"861688\" id=\"span_59\">(See the opinions of\n                    Lords Lowry and Ackner in <a href=\"/doc/861688/\" id=\"a_202\">R. v.

However,\n\n        while undertaking this exercise of judicial review, the same is to\n\n        be done at three levels.               In the first stage, the Court would\n\n        examine as to whether impugned provision in a legislation is\n\n        compatible with the fundamental rights or the Constitutional\n\n        provisions (substantive judicial review) or it falls foul of the federal\n\n        distribution of powers (procedural judicial review).           If it is not\n\n        found to be so, no further exercise is needed as challenge would\n\n        fail.   On the other hand, if it is found that Legislature lacks\n\n        competence as the subject legislated was not within the powers\n\n        assigned in the list in VII Schedule, no further enquiry is needed\n\n        and such a law is to be declared as ultravires the Constitution.\n\n        However, while undertaking substantive judicial review, if it is\n\n        found that the impugned provision appears to be violative of\n\n        fundamental rights or other Constitutional rights, the Court\n\n        reaches the second stage of review. At this second phase of\n\n        enquiry, the Court is supposed to undertake the exercise as to\n\n        whether the impugned provision can still be saved by reading it\n\n\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 247 of 2017 &amp; Ors.                                Page 97\n\f        down so as to bring it in conformity with the Constitutional\n\n        provisions. If that is not achievable then the enquiry enters the\n\n        third stage. If the offending portion of the statute is severable, it\n\n        is severed and the Court strikes down the impugned provision\n\n        declaring the same as unconstitutional.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_173\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_174\">81)    Keeping in view the aforesaid parameters we, at this stage, we\n\n        want to devote some time discussing the arguments of the\n\n        petitioners based on the concept of ‘limited government’.\n\n\nConcent of ‘Limited Government’ and its impact on powers of\nJudicial Review\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_175\">82)    There cannot be any dispute about the manner in which Mr.\n\n        Shyam Divan explained the concept of ‘limited Government’ in his\n\n        submissions.          Undoubtedly, the Constitution of India, as an\n\n        instrument of governance of the State, delineates the functions\n\n        and powers of each wing of the State, namely, the Legislature,\n\n        the Judiciary and the Executive. It also enshrines the principle of\n\n        separation of powers which mandates that each wing of the State\n\n        has to function within its own domain and no wing of the State is\n\n        entitled to trample over the function assigned to the other wing of\n\n        the State.        This fundamental document of governance also\n\n        contains principle of federalism wherein the Union is assigned\n\n\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 247 of 2017 &amp; Ors.                          Page 98\n\f        certain powers and likewise powers of the State are also\n\n        prescribed.        In this context, the Union Legislature, i.e. the\n\n        Parliament, as well as the State Legislatures are given specific\n\n        areas in respect of which they have power to legislate. That is so\n\n        stipulated in Schedule VII of the Constitution wherein List I\n\n        enumerates the subjects over which Parliament has the\n\n        dominion, List II spells out those areas where the State\n\n        Legislatures have the power to make laws while List III is the\n\n        Concurrent List which is accessible both to the Union as well as\n\n        the State Governments. The Scheme pertaining to making laws\n\n        by the Parliament as well as by the Legislatures of the State is\n\n        primarily contained in <a href=\"/doc/574894/\" id=\"a_204\">Articles 245</a> to 254 of the Constitution.\n\n        Therefore, it cannot be disputed that each wing of the State to act\n\n        within the sphere delineated for it under the Constitution. It is\n\n        correct that crossing these limits would render the action of the\n\n        State ultra vires the Constitution. When it comes to power of\n\n        taxation, undoubtedly, power to tax is treated as sovereign power\n\n        of any State. However, there are constitutional limitations briefly\n\n        described above. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"141946357\" id=\"span_61\">In a nine Judge Bench decision of this Court in\n\n        <a href=\"/doc/141946357/\" id=\"a_205\">Jindal Stainless Ltd. &amp; Anr. v.

Therefore, unless the\n\n        petitioner demonstrates that the Parliament, in enacting the\n\n        impugned provision, has exceeded its power prescribed in the\n\n        Constitution or this provision violates any of the provision, the\n\n        argument predicated on ‘limited governance’ will not succeed.\n\n        One of the aforesaid ingredients needs to be established by the\n\n        petitioners in order to succeed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_184\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_185\">86)    Even in the case of Thakur Bharath Singh43 relied upon by Mr.\n\n        Divan, wherein executive order was passed imposing certain\n\n        restrictions requiring the respondent therein to reside at a\n\n        particular place as specified in the order, which was passed in\n\n        exercise of powers contained under <a href=\"/doc/694023/\" id=\"a_218\">Section 3(1)(b)</a> of the M.P.\n\n43     Footnote 9 above\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 247 of 2017 &amp; Ors.

However, the submission of the petitioners\n\n        was that the impugned legislative provision was made as per\n\n        which enrolment under Aadhaar had become mandatory for the\n\n        income tax assessees, whereas this Court has passed various\n\n        orders repeatedly emphasising that enrolment for Aadhaar card\n\n        has to be voluntary.            On this basis, the argument is that the\n\n        Legislature lacked the authority to pass a law contrary to the\n\n        judgments of this Court, without removing the basis of those\n\n        judgments.         It was also argued that even Aadhaar Act was\n\n        voluntary in nature and the basis of the judgments of this Court\n\n        could be taken away only by making enrolment under the\n\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 247 of 2017 &amp; Ors.                            Page 104\n\f        Aadhaar Act compulsory, which was not done.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_167\">89)    Before proceeding to discuss this argument, one aspect of the\n\n        matter needs clarification. There was a debate as to whether\n\n        Aadhaar Act is voluntary or even that Act makes enrolment under\n\n        Aadhaar mandatory.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_168\">90)    First thing that is to be kept in mind is that the Aadhaar Act is\n\n        enacted to enable the Government to identify individuals for\n\n        delivery of benefits, subsidies and services under various welfare\n\n        schemes. This is so mentioned in Section 7 of the Aadhaar Act\n\n        which states that proof of Aadhaar number is necessary for\n\n        receipt of such subsidies, benefits and services. At the same\n\n        time, it cannot be disputed that once a person enrols himself and\n\n        obtains Aadhaar number as mentioned in Section 3 of the\n\n        Aadhaar Act, such Aadhaar number can be used for many other\n\n        purposes.       In fact, this Aadhaar number becomes the Unique\n\n        Identity (UID) of that person. Having said that, it is clear that\n\n        there is no provision in Aadhaar Act which makes enrolment\n\n        compulsory. May be for the purpose of obtaining benefits, proof\n\n        of Aadhaar card is necessary as per <a href=\"/doc/1849490/\" id=\"a_221\">Section 7</a> of the Act. Proviso\n\n        to <a href=\"/doc/1849490/\" id=\"a_222\">Section 7</a> stipulates that if an Aadhaar number is not assigned\n\n        to enable an individual, he shall be offered alternate and viable\n\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 247 of 2017 &amp; Ors.                      Page 105\n\f        means of identification for delivery of the subsidy, benefit or\n\n        service.        According to the petitioners, this proviso, with\n\n        acknowledges alternate and viable means of identification, and\n\n        therefore makes Aadhaar optional and voluntary and the\n\n        enrolment is not necessary even for the purpose of receiving\n\n        subsidies, benefits and services under various schemes of the\n\n        Government.          The respondents, however, interpret the proviso\n\n        differently and there plea is that the words ‘if an Aadhaar number\n\n        is not assigned to an individual’ deal with only that situation where\n\n        application for Aadhaar has been made but for certain reasons\n\n        Aadhaar number has not been assigned as it may take some time\n\n        to give Aadhaar card. Therefore, this proviso is only by way of an\n\n        interim measure till Aadhaar number is assigned, which is\n\n        otherwise compulsory for obtaining certain benefits as stated in\n\n        Section 7 of the Aadhaar Act.          Fact remains that as per the\n\n        Government and UIDAI itself, the requirement of obtaining\n\n        Aadhaar number is voluntary. It has been so claimed by UIDAI\n\n        on its website and clarification to this effect has also been issued\n\n        by UIDAI.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_169\">91)    Thus, enrolment under Aadhaar is voluntary. However, it is a\n\n        moot question as to whether for obtaining benefits as prescribed\n\n\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 247 of 2017 &amp; Ors.                         Page 106\n\f        under Section 7 of the Aadhaar Act, it is mandatory to give\n\n        Aadhaar number or not is a debatable issue which we are not\n\n        addressing as this very issue is squarely raised which is the\n\n        subject matter of other writ petition filed and pending in this Court.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_170\">92)    On the one hand, enrollment under Aadhaar card is voluntary,\n\n        however, for the purposes of <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_223\">Income Tax Act</a>, <a href=\"/doc/190513775/\" id=\"a_224\">Section 139AA</a>\n\n        makes it compulsory for the assessees to give Aadhaar number\n\n        which means insofar as income tax assessees are concerned,\n\n        they have to necessarily enroll themselves under the Aadhaar Act\n\n        and obtain Aadhaar number which will be their identification\n\n        number as that has become the requirement under the <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_225\">Income\n\n        Tax Act</a>. The contention that since enrollment under Aadhaar Act\n\n        is voluntary, it cannot be compulsory under the <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_226\">Income Tax Act</a>,\n\n        cannot be countenanced. As already mentioned above, purpose\n\n        for enrollment under the Aadhaar Act is to avail benefits of various\n\n        welfare schemes etc. as stipulated in Section 7 of the Aadhaar\n\n        Act.    Purpose behind <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_227\">Income Tax Act</a>, on the other hand, is\n\n        entirely different which has already been discussed in detail\n\n        above. For achieving the said purpose, viz., to curb blackimongy,\n\n        money laundering and tax evasion etc., if the Parliament chooses\n\n        to make the provision mandatory under the <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_228\">Income Tax Act</a>, the\n\n\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 247 of 2017 &amp; Ors.                          Page 107\n\f        competence of the Parliament cannot be questioned on the\n\n        ground that it is impermissible only because under Aadhaar Act,\n\n        the provision is directory in nature. It is the prerogative of the\n\n        Parliament to make a particular provision directory in one statute\n\n        and mandatory/compulsory in other. That by itself cannot be a\n\n        ground to question the competence of the legislature. After all,\n\n        Aadhaar Act is not a mother Act. Two laws, i.e., Aadhaar Act, on\n\n        the one hand, and law in the form of <a href=\"/doc/190513775/\" id=\"a_229\">Section 139AA</a> of the Income\n\n        Tax Act, on the other hand, are two different stand alone\n\n        provisions/laws and validity of one cannot be examined in the\n\n        light of provisions of other Acts. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"7087\" id=\"span_63\">In <a href=\"/doc/7087/\" id=\"a_230\">Municipal Corporation of\n\n        Delhi v. Shiv Shanker44</a>, if the objects of two statutory provisions\n\n        are different and language of each statute is restricted to its own\n\n        objects or subject, then they are generally intended to run in\n\n        parallel lines without meeting and there would be no real conflict\n\n        though apparently it may appear to be so on the surface. We\n\n        reproduce hereunder the discussion to the aforesaid aspect\n\n        contained in <a href=\"/doc/7087/\" id=\"a_231\">the said judgment</a>:</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_171\">                    “5. ...

Until this\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_188\">44     (1971) 1 SCC 442\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 247 of 2017 &amp; Ors.                                  Page 108\n\f                    is done it cannot be satisfactorily ascertained if any\n                    fatal inconsistency exists between them. The meaning,\n                    scope and effect of the two statutes, as discovered on\n                    scrutiny, determines the legislative intent as to whether\n                    the earlier law shall cease or shall only be\n                    supplemented. If the objects of the two statutory\n                    provisions are different and the language of each\n                    statute is restricted to its own objects or subject, then\n                    they are generally intended to run in parallel lines\n                    without meeting and there would be no real conflict\n                    though apparently it may appear to be so on the\n                    surface. Statutes in pari materia although in apparent\n                    conflict, should also, so far as reasonably possible, be\n                    construed to be in harmony with each other and it is\n                    only when there is an irreconcilable conflict between\n                    the new provision and the prior statute relating to the\n                    same subject-matter, that the former, being the later\n                    expression of the legislature, may be held to prevail,\n                    the prior law yielding to the extent of the conflict. The\n                    same rule of irreconcilable repugnancy controls\n                    implied repeal of a general by a special statute. The\n                    subsequent provision treating a phase of the same\n                    general subject-matter in a more minute way may be\n                    intended to imply repeal protanto of the repugnant\n                    general provision with which it cannot reasonably\n                    co-exist. When there is no inconsistency between the\n                    general and the special statute the later may well be\n                    construed as supplementary.”\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_189\">93)    In view of the above, we are not impressed by the contention of\n\n        the petitioners that the two enactments are contradictory with\n\n        each other. A harmonious reading of the two enactments would\n\n        clearly suggests that whereas enrollment of Aadhaaar is voluntary\n\n        when it comes to taking benefits of various welfare schemes even\n\n        if it is presumed that requirement of Section 7 of Aadhaar Act that\n\n        it is necessary to provide Aadhaar number to avail the benefits of\n\n        schemes and services, it is upto a person to avail those benefits\n\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 247 of 2017 &amp; Ors.                                Page 109\n\f        or not.     On the other hand, purpose behind enacting <a href=\"/doc/190513775/\" id=\"a_232\">Section\n\n        139AA</a> is to check a menace of black money as well as money\n\n        laundering and also to widen the income tax net so as to cover\n\n        those persons who are evading the payment of tax.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_190\">94)    Main emphasis, however, is on the plea that Parliament or any\n\n        State legislature cannot pass a law that overrules a judgment\n\n        thereby nullifying <a href=\"/doc/7087/\" id=\"a_233\">the said decision</a>, that too without removing the\n\n        basis of the decision. This argument appears to be attractive\n\n        inasmuch as few orders are passed by this Court in pending writ\n\n        petitions which are to the effect that the enrollment of Aadhaar\n\n        would be voluntary. However, it needs to be kept in mind that the\n\n        orders have been passed in the petitions where Aadhaar scheme\n\n        floated as an executive/administrative measure has been\n\n        challenged. In those cases, the said orders are not passed in a\n\n        case where the Court was dealing with a statute passed by the\n\n        Parliament. Further, these are interim orders as the Court was of\n\n        the opinion that till the matter is decided finally in the context of\n\n        Right to Privacy issue, the implementation of the said Aadhaar\n\n        scheme would remain voluntary. In fact, the main issue as to\n\n        whether Aadhaar card scheme whereby biometric data of an\n\n        individual is collected violates Right to Privacy and, therefore, is\n\n        offensive of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_234\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution or not is yet to be\n\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 247 of 2017 &amp; Ors.                         Page 110\n\f        decided. In the process, the Constitution Bench is also called\n\n        upon to decide as to whether Right to Privacy is a part of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_235\">Article\n\n        21</a> of the Constitution at all. Therefore, no final decision has been\n\n        taken. In a situation like this, it cannot be said that Parliament is\n\n        precluded from or it is rendered incompetent to pass such a law.\n\n        That apart, the argument of the petitioners is that the basis on\n\n        which the aforesaid orders are passed has to be removed, which\n\n        is not done. According to the petitioners, it could be done only by\n\n        making Aadhaar Act compulsory.              It is difficult to accept this\n\n        contention for two reasons: first, when the orders passed by this\n\n        Court which are relied upon by the petitioners were passed when\n\n        Aadhaar Act was not even enacted.                 Secondly, as already\n\n        discussed in detail above, Aadhaar Act and the law contained in\n\n        <a href=\"/doc/190513775/\" id=\"a_236\">Section 139AA</a> of the Income Tax Act deal with two different\n\n        situations and operate in different fields.           This argument of\n\n        legislature incompetence also, therefore, has fails.\n\n\n        Whether <a href=\"/doc/190513775/\" id=\"a_237\">Section 139AA</a> of the Act is discriminatory and\n        offends <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_238\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India?\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_191\">               <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_239\">Article 14</a>, which enshrines the principle of equality as a\n\n        fundamental right mandates that the State shall not deny to any\n\n        person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws\n\n        within the territory of India.         It, thus, gives the right to equal\n\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 247 of 2017 &amp; Ors.

One facet is that there shall be no\n\n        privileged person or class and that one shall be above law.\n\n        Another facet is “the obligation upon the State to bring about,\n\n        through the machinery of law, a more equal society...

The Court further observed that <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_241\">Article 14</a> prescribes\n\n        equality before law.

It must, therefore, necessarily have\n\n        the power of making laws to attain particular objects and, for that\n\n        purpose, of distinguishing, selecting and classifying persons and\n\n        things upon which its laws are to operate.                 The principle of\n\n        equality of law, thus, means not that the same law should apply to\n\n        everyone but that a law should deal alike with all in one class;\n\n        that there should be an equality of treatment under equal\n\n        circumstances. It means “that equals should not be treated unlike\n\n        and unlikes should not be treated alike.

Further, it does not allow any kind\n\n       of arbitrariness and ensures fairness and equality of treatment. It\n\n       is the fonjuris of our Constitution, the fountainhead of justice.\n\n       Differential treatment does not per se amount to violation of\n\n       <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_245\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution and it violates <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_246\">Article 14</a> only when\n\n       there is no reasonable basis and there are several tests to decide\n\n       whether a classification is reasonable or not and one of the tests\n\n       will be as to whether it is conducive to the functioning of modern\n\n       society.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_197\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_198\">97)    Insofar as the impugned provision is concerned, Mr. Datar had\n\n        conceded that first test that of reasonable classification had been\n\n        satisfied as he conceded that individual assesses form a separate\n\n        class and the impugned provision which targeted only individual\n\n        assesses would not be discriminatory on this ground.

His submission was that it is only\n\n        the individuals who are responsible for generating black money or\n\n        money laundering. This was the basis for Mr. Datar’s submission.\n\n        We find it somewhat difficult to accept such a submission.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_201\">99)    Unearthing black money or checking money laundering is to be\n\n        achieved to whatever extent possible. Various measures can be\n\n        taken in this behalf. If one of the measures is introduction of\n\n        Aadhaar into the tax regime, it cannot be denounced only\n\n        because of the reason that the purpose would not be achieved\n\n        fully. Such kind of menace, which is deep rooted, needs to be\n\n        tackled by taking multiple actions and those actions may be\n\n        initiated at the same time.            It is the combined effect of these\n\n        actions which may yield results and each individual action\n\n        considered in isolation may not be sufficient.                 Therefore,\n\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 247 of 2017 &amp; Ors.                              Page 115\n\f        rationality of a particular measure cannot be challenged on the\n\n        ground that it has no nexus with the objective to be achieved. Of\n\n        course, there is a definite objective.        For this purpose alone,\n\n        individual measure cannot be ridiculed. We have already taken\n\n        note of the recommendations of SIT on black money headed by\n\n        Justice M.B. Shah.             We have also reproduced the measures\n\n        suggested by the committee headed by Chairman, CBDT on\n\n        ‘Measures to tackle black money in India and Abroad’.           They\n\n        have, in no uncertain terms, suggested that one singular proof of\n\n        identity of a person for entering into finance/business transactions\n\n        etc may go a long way in curbing this foul practice. That apart,\n\n        even if solitary purpose of de-duplication of PAN cards is taken\n\n        into consideration, that may be sufficient to meet the second test\n\n        of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_248\">Article 14.</a> It has come on record that 11.35 lakhs cases of\n\n        duplicate PAN or fraudulent PAN cards have already been\n\n        detected and out of this 10.52 lakh cases pertain to individual\n\n        assessees. Seeding of Aadhaar with PAN has certain benefits\n\n        which have already been enumerated. Furthermore, even when\n\n        we address the issue of shell companies, fact remains that\n\n        companies are after all floated by individuals and these\n\n        individuals have to produce documents to show their identity. It\n\n        was sought to be argued that persons found with duplicate/bogus\n\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 247 of 2017 &amp; Ors.                          Page 116\n\f        PAN cards are hardly 0.4% and, therefore, there was no need to\n\n        have such a provision. We cannot go by percentage figures. The\n\n        absolute number of such cases is 10.52 lakh, which figure, by no\n\n        means, can be termed as miniscule, to harm the economy and\n\n        create adverse effect on the nation. Respondents have argued\n\n        that Aadhaar will ensure that there is no duplication of identity as\n\n        bio-metric will not allow that and, therefore, it may check the\n\n        growth of shell companies as well.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_202\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_203\">100) Having regard to the aforesaid factors, it cannot be said that there\n\n        is no nexus with the objective sought to be achieved.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_204\">101) Another argument predicated on <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_249\">Article 14</a> advanced by Mr. Divan\n\n        was that it was discriminatory in nature as it created two classes;\n\n        one class of those who volunteered to enrol themselves under\n\n        Aadhaar scheme and other class of those who did not want it to\n\n        be so. It was further submitted that in this manner this provision\n\n        had the effect of creating an artificial class of those who object to\n\n        Aadhaar scheme as self conscious persons. This is a fallacious\n\n        argument.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_205\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_206\">102) Validity of a legislative act cannot be challenged by creating\n\n        artificial classes by those who are objecting to the said provision\n\n\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 247 of 2017 &amp; Ors.                         Page 117\n\f        and predicating the argument of discrimination on that basis.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_207\">        When a law is made, all those who are covered by that law are\n\n        supposed to follow the same. No doubt, it is the right of a citizen\n\n        to approach the Court and question the constitutional validity of a\n\n        particular law enacted by the Legislature.           However, merely\n\n        because a section of persons opposes the law, would not mean\n\n        that it has become a separate class by itself.           Two classes,\n\n        cannot be created on this basis, namely, one of those who want\n\n        to be covered by the scheme, and others who do not want to be\n\n        covered thereby.            If such a proposition is accepted, every\n\n        legislation would be prone to challenge on the ground of\n\n        discrimination. As far as plea of discrimination is concerned, it\n\n        has to be raised by showing that the impugned law creates two\n\n        classes without any reasonable classification and treats them\n\n        differently.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_208\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_209\">103) The principle of equality does not mean that every law must have\n\n        universal application for all persons who are not by nature,\n\n        attainment or circumstances, in the same position, as the varying\n\n        needs of different classes of persons often require separate\n\n        treatment. It is permissible for the State to classify persons for\n\n        legitimate purposes.             The Legislature is also competent to\n\n\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 247 of 2017 &amp; Ors.                          Page 118\n\f        exercise its discretion and make classification. In the present\n\n        scenario the impugned legislation has created two classes, i.e.\n\n        one class of those persons who are assessees and other class of\n\n        those persons who are income tax assessees. It is because of\n\n        the reason that the impugned provision is applicable only to those\n\n        who are filing income tax returns. Therefore, the only question\n\n        would be as to whether this classification is reasonable or not.\n\n        There cannot be any dispute that there is a reasonable basis for\n\n        differentiation and, therefore, equal protection clause enshrined in\n\n        <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_250\">Article 14</a> is not attracted.           What <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_251\">Article 14</a> prohibits is class\n\n        legislation and not reasonable classification for the purpose of\n\n        legislation.

Page 125\n\f        <a href=\"/doc/190513775/\" id=\"a_276\">Section 139AA</a> in two parts, as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_209\">        (i)    That portion of the provision which requires quoting of\n\n               Aadhaar number (sub-section(1)) and requirement of\n\n               intimating Aadhaar number to the prescribed authorities by\n\n               these who are PAN holders (sub-section (2)).\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_210\">        (ii)   Consequences of failure to intimate Aadhaar number to the\n\n               prescribed authority by specified date.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_211\">114) Insofar as first limb of <a href=\"/doc/190513775/\" id=\"a_277\">Section 139AA</a> of the Act is concerned, we\n\n        have already held that it was within the competence of the\n\n        Parliament to make a provision of this nature and further that it is\n\n        not offensive of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_278\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution. This requirement,\n\n        per se, does not find foul with <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_279\">Article 19(1)(g)</a> of the Constitution\n\n        either, inasmuch as, quoting the Aadhaar number for purposes\n\n        mentioned in sub-section (1) or intimating the Aadhaar number to\n\n        the prescribed authority as per the requirement of sub-section (2)\n\n        does not, by itself, impinge upon the right to carry on profession\n\n        or trade, etc. Therefore, it is not violative of <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_280\">Article 19(1)(g)</a> of the\n\n        Constitution either. In fact, that is not even the argument of the\n\n        petitioners. Entire emphasis of the petitioners submissions, while\n\n        addressing the arguments predicated on <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_281\">Article 19(1)(g)</a> of the\n\n        Constitution, is on the consequences that ensue in terms of\n\n\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 247 of 2017 &amp; Ors.

Therefore,\n\n        thrust is on the second part of <a href=\"/doc/190513775/\" id=\"a_282\">Section 139AA</a> of the Act, which we\n\n        proceed to deal with, now.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_212\">115) At the outset, it may be mentioned that though PAN is issued\n\n        under the provisions of the Act (<a href=\"/doc/189874154/\" id=\"a_283\">Section 139A</a>), its function is not\n\n        limited to giving this number in the income-tax returns or for other\n\n        acts to be performed under the Act, as mentioned in sub-sections\n\n        (5), (5A), (5B), 5(C), 5(D) and 6 of <a href=\"/doc/189874154/\" id=\"a_284\">Section 139A</a>. Rule 114B of\n\n        the Rules mandates quoting of this PAN in various other\n\n        documents pertaining to different kinds of transactions listed\n\n        therein. It is for sale and purchase of immovable property valued\n\n        at Rs.5 lakhs or more; sale or purchase of motor vehicle etc.,\n\n        while opening deposit account with a sum exceeding Rs.50,000/-\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_217\">        with a banking company; while making deposit of more than\n\n        Rs.50,000/- in any account with Post Office, savings bank; a\n\n        contract of a value exceeding Rs.1 lakh for sale or purchase of\n\n        securities as defined under the <a href=\"/doc/220169/\" id=\"a_285\">Securities Contract (Regulation)\n\n        Act, 1956</a>; while opening an account with a banking company;\n\n        making an application for installation of a telephone connection;\n\n\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 247 of 2017 &amp; Ors.

Thus, if the PAN of a person\n\n        is withdrawn or is nullified, it definitely amounts to placing\n\n        restrictions on the right to do business as a business under <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_286\">Article\n\n        19(1)(g)</a> of the Act. The question would be as to whether these\n\n        restrictions are reasonable and, therefore, meet the requirement\n\n        of clause (6) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_287\">Article 19.</a> In this context, when ‘balancing’ is to\n\n        be done, doctrine of proportionality can be applied, which was\n\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 247 of 2017 &amp; Ors.

Thus, while\n                    examining as to whether the impugned provisions of\n                    the statute and rules amount to reasonable restrictions\n                    and are brought out in the interest of the general\n                    public, the exercise that is required to be undertaken\n                    is the balancing of fundamental right to carry on\n                    occupation on the one hand and the restrictions\n                    imposed on the other hand. This is what is known as\n                    “doctrine      of    proportionality”.   Jurisprudentially,\n                    “proportionality” can be defined as the set of rules\n                    determining the necessary and sufficient conditions for\n                    limitation of a constitutionally protected right by a law\n                    to be constitutionally permissible. According to Aharon\n                    Barak (former Chief Justice, Supreme Court of Israel),\n                    there are four sub-components of proportionality which\n                    need to be satisfied [ Aharon Barak, Proportionality:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_219\">                    Constitutional Rights and Their Limitation(Cambridge\n                    University Press 2012).], a limitation of a constitutional\n                    right will be constitutionally permissible if:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_220\">                    (i) it is designated for a proper purpose;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_221\">                    (ii) the measures undertaken to effectuate such a\n                    limitation are rationally connected to the fulfilment of\n                    that purpose;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_222\">                    (iii) the measures undertaken are necessary in that\n                    there are no alternative measures that may similarly\n                    achieve that same purpose with a lesser degree of\n                    limitation; and finally\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_223\">                    (iv) there needs to be a proper relation\n                    (“proportionality stricto sensu” or “balancing”) between\n                    the importance of achieving the proper purpose and\n                    the social importance of preventing the limitation on\n                    the constitutional right.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_219\">                    61. Modern theory of constitutional rights draws a\n                    fundamental distinction between the scope of the\n                    constitutional rights, and the extent of its protection.\n                    Insofar as the scope of constitutional rights is\n                    concerned, it marks the outer boundaries of the said\n                    rights and defines its contents. The extent of its\n                    protection prescribes the limitations on the exercises\n                    of the rights within its scope. In that sense, it defines\n                    the justification for limitations that can be imposed on\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 247 of 2017 &amp; Ors.                                 Page 130\n\f                    such a right.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_220\">                    62. It is now almost accepted that there are no\n                    absolute constitutional rights and all such rights are\n                    related. As per the analysis of Aharon Barak, two key\n                    elements in developing the modern constitutional\n                    theory of recognising positive constitutional rights\n                    along with its limitations are the notions of democracy\n                    and the rule of law. Thus, the requirement of\n                    proportional limitations of constitutional rights by a\n                    sub-constitutional law i.e. the statute, is derived from\n                    an interpretation of the notion of democracy itself.\n                    Insofar as the Indian Constitution is concerned,\n                    democracy is treated as the basic feature of the\n                    Constitution and is specifically accorded a\n                    constitutional status that is recognised in the Preamble\n                    of the Constitution itself. It is also unerringly accepted\n                    that this notion of democracy includes human rights\n                    which is the cornerstone of Indian democracy. Once\n                    we accept the aforesaid theory (and there cannot be\n                    any denial thereof), as a fortiori, it has also to be\n                    accepted that democracy is based on a balance\n                    between constitutional rights and the public interests.\n                    In fact, such a provision in <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_291\">Article 19</a> itself on the one\n                    hand guarantees some certain freedoms in clause (1)\n                    of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_292\">Article 19</a> and at the same time empowers the State\n                    to impose reasonable restrictions on those freedoms\n                    in public interest. This notion accepts the modern\n                    constitutional theory that the constitutional rights are\n                    related. This relativity means that a constitutional\n                    licence to limit those rights is granted where such a\n                    limitation will be justified to protect public interest or\n                    the rights of others. This phenomenon—of both the\n                    right and its limitation in the Constitution—exemplifies\n                    the inherent tension between democracy&#x27;s two\n                    fundamental elements. On the one hand is the right&#x27;s\n                    element, which constitutes a fundamental component\n                    of substantive democracy; on the other hand is the\n                    people element, limiting those very rights through their\n                    representatives. These two constitute a fundamental\n                    component of the notion of democracy, though this\n                    time in its formal aspect. How can this tension be\n                    resolved? The answer is that this tension is not\n                    resolved by eliminating the “losing” facet from the\n                    Constitution. Rather, the tension is resolved by way of\n                    a proper balancing of the competing principles. This is\n                    one of the expressions of the multi-faceted nature of\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 247 of 2017 &amp; Ors.                                 Page 131\n\f                    democracy. Indeed, the inherent tension between\n                    democracy&#x27;s different facets is a “constructive\n                    tension”. It enables each facet to develop while\n                    harmoniously coexisting with the others. The best way\n                    to achieve this peaceful coexistence is through\n                    balancing between the competing interests. Such\n                    balancing enables each facet to develop alongside the\n                    other facets, not in their place. This tension between\n                    the two fundamental aspects—rights on the one hand\n                    and its limitation on the other hand—is to be resolved\n                    by balancing the two so that they harmoniously coexist\n                    with each other. This balancing is to be done keeping\n                    in mind the relative social values of each competitive\n                    aspects when considered in proper context.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_221\">                    63. In this direction, the next question that arises is as\n                    to what criteria is to be adopted for a proper balance\n                    between the two facets viz. the rights and limitations\n                    imposed upon it by a statute. Here comes the concept\n                    of “proportionality”, which is a proper criterion. To put it\n                    pithily, when a law limits a constitutional right, such a\n                    limitation is constitutional if it is proportional. The law\n                    imposing restrictions will be treated as proportional if it\n                    is meant to achieve a proper purpose, and if the\n                    measures taken to achieve such a purpose are\n                    rationally connected to the purpose, and such\n                    measures are necessary. This essence of doctrine of\n                    proportionality is beautifully captured by Dickson, C.J.\n                    of Canada in R. v.

While defining as to\n                    what constitutes a reasonable restriction, this Court in\n                    a plethora of judgments has held that the expression\n                    “reasonable restriction” seeks to strike a balance\n                    between the freedom guaranteed by any of the\n                    sub-clauses of clause (1) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_295\">Article 19</a> and the social\n                    control permitted by any of the clauses (2) to (6).

In particular, rapid economic growth has been\n\n        achieved in the last 25 years, after the country adopted the policy\n\n        of liberalisation and entered the era of, what is known as,\n\n        globalisation.       Economic growth in the last decade has been\n\n        phenomenal and for many years, the Indian economy grew at\n\n        highest rate in the world. At the same time, it is also a fact that in\n\n        spite of significant political and economic success which has\n\n        proved to be sound and sustainable, the benefits thereof have not\n\n        percolated down to the poor and the poorest.                In fact, such\n\n        benefits are reaped primarily by rich and upper middle classes,\n\n        resulting into widening the gap between the rich and the poor.\n\n        Jean Dreze &amp; Amartya Sen eithly narrate the position as under 50:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_236\">                    “Since India’s recent record of fast economic growth is\n                    often celebrated, with good reason, it is extremely\n                    important to point to the fact that the societal reach of\n                    economic progress in India has been remarkably\n                    limited. It is not only that the income distribution has\n                    been getting more unequal in recent years (a\n                    characteristic that India shares with China), but also\n                    that the rapid rise in real wages in China from which\n                    the working classes have benefited greatly is not\n\n50     An Uncertain Glory : India and its Contradictions\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 247 of 2017 &amp; Ors.

No less importantly, the public revenue\n                    generated by rapid economic growth has not been\n                    used to expand the social and physical infrastructure\n                    in a determined and well-planned way (in this India is\n                    left far behind by China). There is also a continued\n                    lack of essential social services (from schooling and\n                    health care to the provision of safe water and\n                    drainage) for a huge part of the population. As we will\n                    presently discuss, while India has been overtaking\n                    other countries in the progress of its real income, it\n                    has been overtaken in terms of social indicators by\n                    many of these countries, even within the region of\n                    South Asia itself (we go into this question more fully in\n                    Chapter 3, ‘India in Comparative Perspective’).\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_227\">                       To point to just one contrast, even though India has\n                    significantly caught up with China in terms of GDP\n                    growth, its progress has been very much slower than\n                    China’s in indicators such as longevity, literacy, child\n                    undernourishment and maternal mortality. In South\n                    Asia itself, the much poorer economy of Bangladesh\n                    has caught up with and overtaken India in terms of\n                    many social indicators (including life expectancy,\n                    immunization of children, infant mortality, child\n                    undernourishment and girls’ schooling). Even Nepal\n                    has been catching up, to the extent that it now has\n                    many social indicators similar to India’s, in spite of its\n                    per capita GDP being just about one third. Whereas\n                    twenty years ago India generally had the second-best\n                    social indicators among the six South Asia countries\n                    (India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal and\n                    Bhutan), it now looks second worst (ahead only of\n                    problem-ridden Pakistan). India has been climbing up\n                    the ladder of per capita income while slipping down\n                    the slope of social indicators.”\n\n               It is in this context that not only sustainable development is\n\n        needed which takes care of integrating growth and development,\n\n        thereby ensuring that the benefit of economic growth is reaped by\n\n        every citizen of this country, it also becomes the duty of the\n\n        Government in a welfare State to come out with various welfare\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 247 of 2017 &amp; Ors.

As mentioned above,\n\n        various welfare schemes are, in fact, devised and floated from\n\n        time to time by the Government, keeping aside substantial\n\n        amount of money earmarked for spending on socially and\n\n        economically backward classes. However, for various reasons\n\n        including corruption, actual benefit does not reach those who are\n\n        supposed to receive such benefits. One of the main reasons is\n\n        failure to identify these persons for lack of means by which\n\n        identity could be established of such genuine needy class.\n\n        Resultantly, lots of ghosts and duplicate beneficiaries are able to\n\n        take undue and impermissible benefits. A former Prime Minister\n\n        of this country51 has gone to record to say that out of one rupee\n\n        spent by the Government for welfare of the downtrodden, only 15\n\n        paisa thereof actually reaches those persons for whom it is\n\n        meant. It cannot be doubted that with UID/Aadhaar much of the\n\n        malaise in this field can be taken care of.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_228\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_229\">        (ii)   Menace of corruption and black money has reached\n\n        alarming proportion in this country.

Page 138\n\f        progress which the country is otherwise achieving.       It is not\n\n        necessary to go into the various reasons for this menace.\n\n        However, it would be pertinent to comment that even as per the\n\n        observations of the Special Investigation Team (SIT) on black\n\n        money headed by Justice M.B. Shah, one of the reasons is that\n\n        persons have the option to quote their PAN or UID or passport\n\n        number or driving licence or any other proof of identity while\n\n        entering into financial/business transactions.   Because of this\n\n        multiple methods of giving proofs of identity, there is no\n\n        mechanism/system at present to collect the data available with\n\n        each of the independent proofs of ID. For this reason, even SIT\n\n        suggested that these databases be interconnected. To the same\n\n        effect is the recommendation of the Committee headed by\n\n        Chairman, CBDT on measures to tackle black money in India and\n\n        abroad which also discusses the problem of money-laundering\n\n        being done to evade taxes under the garb of shell companies by\n\n        the persons who hold multiple bogus PAN numbers under\n\n        different names or variations of their names.       That can be\n\n        possible if one uniform proof of identity, namely, UID is adopted.\n\n        It may go a long way to check and minimise the said malaise.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_230\">        (iii)    Thirdly, Aadhaar or UID, which has come to be known as\n\n\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 247 of 2017 &amp; Ors.

No\n\n        doubt, going by aforesaid, and may be some other similarly valid\n\n        considerations, it is the intention of the Government to give phillip\n\n        to Aadhaar movement and encourage the people of this country\n\n        to enroll themselves under the Aadhaar scheme.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_231\">119) Wether such a scheme should remain voluntary or it can be made\n\n       mandatory imposing compulsiveness on the people to be covered\n\n       by Aadhaar is a different question which shall be addressed at the\n\n       appropriate stage. At this juncture, it is only emphasised that\n\n       malafides cannot be attributed to this scheme. In any case, we\n\n       are concerned with the vires of <a href=\"/doc/190513775/\" id=\"a_302\">Section 139AA</a> of the Income Tax\n\n       Act, 1961 which is a statutory provision.         This Court is, thus,\n\n       dealing with the aspect of judicial review of legislation. Insofar as\n\n       this provision is concerned, the explanation of the respondents in\n\n       the counter affidavit, which has already been reproduced above,\n\n       is that the primary purpose of introducing this provision was to\n\n       take care of the problem of multiple PAN cards obtained in\n\n       fictitious names.          Such multiple cards in fictitious names are\n\n\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 247 of 2017 &amp; Ors.

It is\n\n       mentioned that in a de-duplication exercises, 11.35 lakhs cases of\n\n       duplicate PANs/fraudulent PANs have been detected.              Out of\n\n       these, around 10.52 lakhs pertain to individual assessees.\n\n       Parliament in its wisdom thought that one PAN to one person can\n\n       be ensured by adopting Aadhaar for allottment of PAN to\n\n       individuals. As of today, that is the only method available i.e. by\n\n       seeding of existing PAN with Aadhaar. It is perceived as the best\n\n       method, and the only robust method of de-duplication of PAN\n\n       database. It is claimed by the respondents that the instance of\n\n       duplicate Aadhaar is almost non-existent. It is also claimed that\n\n       seeding of PAN with Aadhaar may contribute to widening of the\n\n       tax case as well, by checking the tax evasions and bringing in to\n\n       tax hold those persons who are liable to pay tax but deliberately\n\n       avoid doing so.            It would be apposite to quote the following\n\n       discussion by the Comptroller and Auditor General in its report for\n\n       the year 2011:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_237\">                    “Widening of Tax Base\n\n                    The assessee base grew over the last five years from\n                    297.9 lakh taxpayers in 2005-06 to 340.9 lakh\n                    taxpayers in 2009-10 at the rate of 14.4 per cent.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_232\">                    The Department has different mechanisms available to\n                    enhance the assessee base which include inspection\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 247 of 2017 &amp; Ors.

The returns filled in\n                    2008-09 and 2009-10 were 326.5 lakh and 340.9 lakh\n                    respectively. The gap between PANs and the number\n                    of returns filed was 617.1 lakh in 2009-10. The Board\n                    needs to identify the reasons for the gap and use this\n                    information for appropriately enhancing the assessee\n                    base.     The gap may be due to issuance of\n                    duplicate PAN cards and death of some PAN card\n                    holders. The Department needs to put in place\n                    appropriate controls to weed out the duplicate\n                    PANs and also update the position in respect of\n                    deceased assessee. It is significant to note that\n                    the number of PAN card holders has increased by\n                    117.7 per cent between 2005-06 to 2009-10\n                    whereas the number of returns filed in the same\n                    period has increased by 14.4 per cent only.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_233\">                                                      (emphasis supplied)\n\n                    The total direct tax collection has increased by 128.8\n                    per cent during the period 2005-06 to 2009-10. The\n                    increase in the tax collection was around nine times as\n                    compared to increase in the assessee base.

It was next argued on behalf of the dealers that\n                    an unreasonably high rate of tax could by itself\n                    constitute a restriction offensive to <a href=\"/doc/121190/\" id=\"a_306\">Article 301</a> of the\n                    Constitution. This was according to learned counsel\n                    for the dealers acknowledged even in the minority\n                    judgment delivered by Sinha, CJ in Atiabari&#x27;s\n                    case (supra). If that be so, the only way such a\n                    restriction could meet the constitutional requirements\n                    would be through the medium of the proviso to <a href=\"/doc/191273/\" id=\"a_307\">Article\n                    304(b)</a> of the Constitution. There is, in our opinion, no\n                    merit in that contention either and we say so for two\n                    precise reasons. Firstly, because taxes whether high\n                    or low do not constitute restrictions on the freedom of\n                    trade and commerce. We have held so in the previous\n                    paragraphs of the judgment based on our textual\n                    understanding of the provisions of Part XIII which is\n                    matched by the contextual interpretation. That being\n52     Footnote 40 above\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 247 of 2017 &amp; Ors.                               Page 146\n\f                    so the mere fact that a tax casts a heavy burden is no\n                    reason for holding that it is a restriction on the freedom\n                    of trade and commerce. Any such excessive tax\n                    burden may be open to challenge under Part III of the\n                    Constitution but the extent of burden would not by\n                    itself justify the levy being struck down as a restriction\n                    contrary to <a href=\"/doc/121190/\" id=\"a_308\">Article 301</a> of the Constitution.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_240\">                    110. Secondly because, levy of taxes is both an\n                    attribute of sovereignty and an unavoidable necessity.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_241\">                    No responsible government can do without levying\n                    and collecting taxes for it is only through taxes that\n                    governments are run and objectives of general public\n                    good achieved. The conceptual or juristic basis\n                    underlying the need for taxation has not, therefore,\n                    been disputed by learned counsel for the dealers and,\n                    in our opinion, rightly so. That taxation is essential for\n                    fulfilling the needs of the government is even\n                    otherwise well-settled. A reference to “A Treatise on\n                    the Constitutional Limitations” (8th Edn. 1927 - Vol. II\n                    Page 986) by Thomas M Cooley brings home the point\n                    with commendable clarity. Dealing with power of\n                    taxation Cooley says:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_241\">                          “Taxes are defined to be burdens or charges\n                          imposed by the legislative power upon\n                          persons or property, to raise money for public\n                          purposes. The power to tax rests upon\n                          necessity, and is inherent in every\n                          sovereignty. The legislature of every free\n                          State will possess it under the general grant\n                          of legislative power, whether particularly\n                          specified in the constitution among the\n                          powers to be exercised by it or not. No\n                          constitutional government can exist without\n                          it, and no arbitrary government without\n                          regular and steady taxation could be\n                          anything but an oppressive and vexatious\n                          despotism, since the only alternative to\n                          taxation would be a forced extortion for the\n                          needs of government from such persons or\n                          objects as the men in power might select as\n                          victims.”\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_242\">                    111.

If Aadhar number is not given, the\n\n        aforesaid exercise may not be possible.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_242\">125) Having said so, it becomes clear from the aforesaid discussion\n\n        that those who are not PAN holders, while applying for PAN, they\n\n        are required to give Aadhaar number. This is the stipulation of\n\n        sub-section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/190513775/\" id=\"a_316\">Section 139AA</a>, which we have already upheld.\n\n        At the same time, as far as existing PAN holders are concerned,\n\n        since the impugned provisions are yet to be considered on the\n\n        touchstone of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_317\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution, including on the\n\n        debate around Right to Privacy and human dignity, etc. as limbs\n\n        of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_318\">Article 21</a>, we are of the opinion that till the aforesaid aspect of\n\n        <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_319\">Article 21</a> is decided by the Constitution Bench a partial stay of\n\n        the aforesaid proviso is necessary.

However, those\n\n        assessees who are not Aadhaar card holders and do not comply\n\n        with the provision of <a href=\"/doc/43144358/\" id=\"a_321\">Section 139(2)</a>, their PAN cards be not\n\n        treated as invalid for the time being. It is only to facilitate other\n\n        transactions which are mentioned in Rule 114B of the Rules. We\n\n        are adopting this course of action for more than one reason. We\n\n        are saying so because of very severe consequences that entail in\n\n        not adhering to the requirement of sub-section (2) of <a href=\"/doc/190513775/\" id=\"a_322\">Section\n\n        139AA</a> of the Act. A person who is holder of PAN and if his PAN\n\n        is invalidated, he is bound to suffer immensely in his day to day\n\n        dealings, which situation should be avoided till the Constitution\n\n        Bench authoritatively determines the argument of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_323\">Article 21</a> of the\n\n        Constitution. Since we are adopting this course of action, in the\n\n        interregnum, it would be permissible for the Parliament to\n\n        consider as to whether there is a need to tone down the effect of\n\n        the said proviso by limiting the consequences.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_243\">126) However, at the same time, we find that proviso to <a href=\"/doc/178877346/\" id=\"a_324\">Section\n\n        139AA(2)</a> cannot be read retrospectively. If failure to intimate the\n\n        Aadhaar number renders PAN void ab initio with the deeming\n\n        provision that the PAN allotted would be invalid as if the person\n\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 247 of 2017 &amp; Ors.

It has the effect of undoing\n\n        all the acts done by a person on the basis of such a PAN. It may\n\n        have even the effect of incurring other penal consequences under\n\n        the Act for earlier period on the ground that there was no PAN\n\n        registration by a particular assessee.       The rights which are\n\n        already accrued to a person in law cannot be taken away.\n\n        Therefore, this provision needs to be read down by making it\n\n        clear that it would operate prospectively.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_244\">127) Before we part with, few comments are needed, as we feel that\n\n        these are absolutely essential:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_248\">        (i)    Validity of Aadhaar, whether it is under the Aadhaar scheme\n\n        or the Aadhaar Act, is already under challenge on the touchstone\n\n        of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_325\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. Various facets of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_326\">Article 21</a> are\n\n        pressed into service. First and foremost is that it violates Right to\n\n        Privacy and Right to Privacy is part of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_327\">Article 21</a> of the\n\n        Constitution. Secondly, it is also argued that it violates human\n\n        dignity which is another aspect of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_328\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_245\">        Since the said matter has already been referred to the\n\n        Constitution Bench, we have consciously avoided discussion,\n\n        though submissions in this behalf have been taken note of. We\n\n        feel that all the aspect of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_329\">Article 21</a> needs to be dealt with by the\n\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 247 of 2017 &amp; Ors.                          Page 151\n\f        Constitution Bench.             That is a reason we have deliberately\n\n        refrained from entering into the said arena.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_246\">        (ii)    It was submitted by the counsel for the petitioners\n\n        themselves that they would be confining their challenge to the\n\n        impugned provision on <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_330\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_331\">19</a> of the Constitution as\n\n        well as competence of the Legislature, while addressing the\n\n        arguments, other facets of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_332\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution were also\n\n        touched upon. Since we are holding that <a href=\"/doc/190513775/\" id=\"a_333\">Section 139AA</a> of the\n\n        Income Tax Act is not violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_334\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_335\">19(1)(g)</a> of the\n\n        Constitution and also that there was no impediment in the way of\n\n        Parliament to insert such a statutory provision (subject to reading\n\n        down the proviso to sub-section (2) of <a href=\"/doc/190513775/\" id=\"a_336\">Section 139AA</a> of the Act\n\n        as given above), we make it clear that the impugned provision\n\n        has passed the muster of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_337\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_338\">19(1)(g)</a> of the\n\n        Constitution.       However, more stringent test as to whether this\n\n        statutory provision violates <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_339\">Article 21</a> or not is yet to be qualified.\n\n        Therefore, we make it clear that Constitutional validity of this\n\n        provision is upheld subject to the outcome of batch of petitions\n\n        referred to the Constitution Bench where the said issue is to be\n\n        examined.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_247\">        (iii)   It is also necessary to highlight that a large section of\n\n        citizens feel concerned about possible data leak, even when\n\n\nWrit Petition (Civil) No. 247 of 2017 &amp; Ors.
