The Supreme Court in the case of Meera Santosh Pal &amp; others\n           Versus Union of India and others {(2017) 3 SCC 462} has reiterated\n           the view taken in the case of Suchita Srivastava Vs.

In Suchita Srivastava v. Chandigarh Admn {(2009) 9\n                 SCC 1} a Bench of three Judges held &quot;a woman&#x27;s right to\n                 make reproductive choices is also a dimension of &#x27;personal\n                 liberty&#x27; as understood under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_3\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution&quot;.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\">                 The Court there dealt with the importance of the consent of\n                 the pregnant woman as an essential requirement for\n                 proceeding with the termination of pregnancy. The Court\n                 observed as follows :-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">                 &quot;22. There is no doubt that a woman&#x27;s right to make\n                 reproductive choices is also a dimension of &quot;personal\n                 liberty&quot; as understood under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_4\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of\n                 India. It is important to recognise that reproductive choices\n                 can be exercised to procreate as well as to abstain from\n                 procreating. The crucial consideration is that a woman&#x27;s\n                 right to privacy, dignity and bodily integrity should be\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                     3</span>\n\n\n                respected. This means that there should be no restriction\n                whatsoever on the exercise of reproductive choices such as\n                a woman&#x27;s right to refuse participation in sexual activity or\n                alternatively the insistence on use of contraceptive methods.\n                Furthermore, women are also free to choose birth control\n                methods such as undergoing sterilisation procedures. Taken\n                to their logical conclusion, reproductive rights include a\n                woman&#x27;s entitlement to carry a pregnancy to its full term, to\n                give birth and to subsequently raise children.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_13\">           7. Reading of <a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_5\">section 3</a> of the Medical Termination of Pregnancy\n           Act, 1971 (hereinafter referred to as &#x27;the Act of 1971&#x27;) makes it\n           clear that where length of pregnancy does not exceed 20 weeks\n           and not less than two registered medical practitioners have\n           formed an opinion in good faith that the continuance of pregnancy\n           would involve a risk to the life of pregnant woman or grave injury\n           to her physical or mental health, the pregnancy can be terminated\n           by a registered medical practitioner. This act of medical\n           practitioner, if aforesaid conditions are satisfied, will not attract\n           the penal provisions mentioned in <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_6\">Indian Penal Code</a>. In other\n           words, such registered medical practitioner shall not be guilty of\n           any offence under the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_7\">IPC</a> or under any other law for the time\n           being in force if conditions mentioned in <a href=\"/doc/189755549/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 3</a> or <a href=\"/doc/153588598/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 5</a> of\n           the Act are satisfied.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">           8.

As evident from its literal description, the &quot;best interests&quot; test\n         requires the Court to ascertain the course of action which would\n         serve the best interests of the person in question. In the present\n         setting this means that the Court must undertake a careful inquiry of\n         the medical opinion on the feasibility of the pregnancy as well as\n         social circumstances faced by the victim. It is important to note that\n         the Court&#x27;s decision should be guided by the interests of the victim\n         alone and not those of the other stakeholders such as guardians or\n         the society in general. It is evident that the woman in question will\n         need care and assistance which will in turn entail some costs.\n         However, that cannot be a ground for denying the exercise of\n         reproductive rights.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\"> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"73782861\" id=\"span_5\">9.
