Sri Clifton D. Rozario learned counsel appearing for\n\nSmt.Shilpa Prasad, advocate for petitioner submitted, petitioner\n\nobtained Bachelor of Arts Degree from Mahatma Gandhi\n\nUniversity and Master of Arts in Development Studies from\n\nTATA Institute of Social Sciences. It was submitted, during year\n\n2015,        petitioner   realized,   she   was   a   female   to    male\n\ntransgender person (&#x27;TG&#x27; for short). Accordingly, an Affidavit of\n                                -4-\n\n\n\n\nDeclaration was sworn to on 20.11.2018 as per Annexure-A\n\nand change of name was gazetted in May, 2019 as per\n\nAnnexure-B, whereunder, petitioner adopted new name as &#x27;Esvi\n\nAnbu Kothazham&#x27;. By a subsequent affidavit sworn to on\n\n06.08.2022 before Notary Public, name was changed to Mugil\n\nAnbu Vasantha due to adoption of change of gender from\n\n&#x27;female&#x27; to &#x27;transgender&#x27;. Said change was also gazetted during\n\nAugust, 2022 as per Annexure-D. Consequent changes were\n\nalso effected in Aadhaar Card, PAN Card etc.\n\n\n     3.      It was submitted on 16.01.2023, respondent no.3 -\n\nNational Law School of India University (&#x27;NLSIU&#x27; for short)\n\nissued notification calling for application for admission to LLB\n\nCourse. As petitioner intended to study same, application along\n\nwith documents on 22.03.2023 as per Annexure-H was filed\n\nand appeared in NLSAT exams. As per Annexure-L, petitioner\n\nsecured cumulative score of 96.25 (Part-A + Part-B). Despite\n\nsaid score, petitioner was denied admission.\n\n\n     4.      Therefore, a representation dated 12.06.2023 as\n\nper Annexure-N was submitted for review of decision denying\n\nadmission.   Petitioner   brought    to   notice   of   NLSIU   about\n\nrequirement for providing reservation to TGs as per decision of\n                                  -5-\n\n\n\n\nHon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in NALSA v. Union of India reported\n\nin (2014) 5 SCC 438 and observations made by High Court of\n\nMadras in S. Tharika Banu v. Secretary to Government\n\n(W.P.no.26628/2017 and connected cases disposed of on\n\n29.11.2017).\n\n\n      5.    Further representations were made on 19.06.2023\n\nas per Annexure-P and Q. Despite receipt, no action was taken.\n\nIt was submitted, respondent no.1 - State had adopted\n\nKarnataka State Policy on Transgenders, 2017 - Annexure-T\n\n(hereinafter referred to as &#x27;TG Policy&#x27;), which at paragraph\n\nno.1.4, contemplated support measures such as scholarships\n\netc. Likewise, in paragraph no.9.3 under heading &#x27;Schemes for\n\nEducation&#x27;, education grants following norms for grant of\n\nscholarships to OBC students was contemplated. Even provision\n\nfor fee-waiver, free text books, free hostel accommodation and\n\nother facilities at subsidised rates was contemplated. But, no\n\navail to petitioner. Therefore, petitioner filed this petition.\n\n\n      6.    It was submitted this Court by interim order dated\n\n22.08.2023, directed NLSIU to admit petitioner in three year\n\nLL.B Course for academic year 2023-24, if petitioner was\n\neligible, subject to out come of writ petition. It was submitted,\n                                     -6-\n\n\n\n\nW.A.no.1025/2023 filed challenging above interim order was\n\ndismissed on 04.09.2023.\n\n\n      7.     It was submitted, though petitioner was granted\n\nadmission    as    directed      and   petitioner      managed     to    pay\n\nRs.50,000/- on 29.08.2023, demand was made for balance fee\n\nof Rs.3,25,500/-. Unable to pay remaining amount, petitioner\n\nfiled application for financial assistance under NLSIU Financial\n\nAid Scheme on 30.08.2023. In meanwhile, NLSIU expressed\n\nintention to cancel admission.\n\n\n      8.     Therefore,        petitioner    filed     I.A.no.2/2023      for\n\ndirection   to    NLSIU   to    comply      with     interim   order    dated\n\n22.08.2023 and to take decision on request for financial aid.\n\nApplication was appended with petitioner&#x27;s representations\n\ndated 23.08.2023, 24.08.2023 &amp; 25.08.2023 along with replies\n\ndated 28.08.2023, 29.08.2023 &amp; 30.08.2023. Even petitioner&#x27;s\n\nE-mail to Office of Student Affairs dated 01.09.2023 was also\n\nproduced.\n\n\n      9.     It was submitted, in its objection to I.A.no.2/2023,\n\nNLSIU had merely stated, application for financial aid was not\n\nsupported with adequate documentation. After calling upon for\n                                -7-\n\n\n\n\nproduction and considering same, Financial Aid Committee\n\ndecided to grant partial financial aid. Same was communicated\n\nby E-mail dated 27.09.2023 - Annexure-R4 followed by demand\n\nfor balance amount. It was submitted, furnishing of details of\n\nbanks and financial institutions, which had tie-up with NLSIU\n\nfor educational loan would be of no use herein, as petitioner\n\nwas unable to comply with requirements stipulated by Banks.\n\nSaid difficulties arose primarily due to fact that petitioner was\n\nTG, who had lost financial and other support from parents and\n\nrelatives, etc. It was submitted, petitioner was surviving on\n\nhelp from few TG community well-wishers, which was not\n\nsufficient to bear exorbitant fees. Entire action of NLSIU was\n\nindicative of intention to frustrate petitioner from taking benefit\n\nof interim order. Despite same, demand for further documents\n\nindicated   NLSIU   was   cold-shouldering   request.   Therefore,\n\npetitioner filed I.A.no.3/2023 for amendment of writ petition for\n\nadditional facts, grounds and prayer.\n\n\n      10.   Narrating above petitioner filed affidavit dated\n\n19.01.2024. In above facts and circumstances, petitioner\n\nprayed for allowing writ petition. In support, learned counsel\n\nrelied on directions issued in NALSA&#x27;s case (supra) as follows:\n                              -8-\n\n\n\n\n&quot;135.    We, therefore, declare:\n\n135.1.   Hijras, eunuchs, apart from binary genders, be treated\n         as &quot;third gender&quot; for the purpose of safeguarding their\n         rights under Part III of our Constitution and the laws\n         made by Parliament and the State Legislature.\n\n135.2.   Transgender persons&#x27; right to decide their self-\n         identified gender is also upheld and the Centre and\n         State Governments are directed to grant legal\n         recognition of their gender identity such as male,\n         female or as third gender.\n\n135.3.   We direct the Centre and the State Governments to\n         take steps to treat them as Socially and Educationally\n         Backward Classes of citizens and extend all kinds of\n         reservation in cases of admission in educational\n         institutions and for public appointments.\n\n135.4.   The Centre and State Governments are directed to\n         operate separate HIV serosurveillance centres since\n         hijras/transgenders face several sexual health issues.\n\n135.5.   The Centre and State Governments should seriously\n         address problems being faced by hijras/transgenders\n         such as fear, shame, gender dysphoria, social\n         pressure, depression, suicidal tendencies, social\n         stigma, etc. and any insistence for SRS for declaring\n         one&#x27;s gender is immoral and illegal.\n\n135.6.   The Centre and State Governments should take proper\n         measures to provide medical care to TGs in the\n         hospitals and also provide them separate public toilets\n         and other facilities.\n\n135.7.   The Centre and State Governments should also take\n         steps for framing various social welfare schemes for\n         their betterment.\n\n135.8.   The Centre and State Governments should take steps\n         to create public awareness so that TGs will feel that\n         they are also part and parcel of the social life and be\n         not treated as untouchables.\n\n135.9.   The Centre and the State Governments should also\n         take measures to regain their respect and place in the\n         society which once they enjoyed in our cultural and\n         social life.\n                                      -9-\n\n\n\n\n        136.     We are informed an expert committee has already\n                 been constituted to make an in-depth study of\n                 problems faced by transgender community and\n                 suggest measures that can be taken by Government to\n                 ameliorate their problems and to submit its report with\n                 recommendations      within  three  months     of   its\n                 constitution. Let the recommendations be examined\n                 based on the legal declaration made in this judgment\n                 and implemented within six months.&quot;\n\n        11.     It was submitted, under similar circumstances, High\n\nCourt      of   Uttarakhand     in   case    of   Rano      v.   State     of\n\nUttarakhand, reported in 2018 SCC OnLine Utt. 1291, had\n\nissued directions to provide for reservation in favour of TGs as\n\nfollows:\n\n         &quot;8. The State of Odisha has framed a scheme for Promotion\n             of Transgender Equality &amp; Justice. The scheme speaks of\n             medical assistance to the parents of transgenders. Pre\n             and Post Matric Scholarship, Personality Development,\n             Skill Upgradation Training, Self Employment, role of\n             District Administration, role of block/ULB Administration\n             and Budget Provision &amp; Utilization. Accordingly, the writ\n             petition is disposed of by issuing following mandatory\n             directions:--\n         A. The Senior Superintendent of Police, Dehradun is directed\n             to provide necessary protection to petitioners in both\n             petitions.\n         B. We direct State Government to provide reservation in\n             admission in educational institutions and for public\n             appointments to transgenders by framing a scheme\n             within a period of six months from today.\n         C. State Government is directed to frame various social\n             welfare    schemes/programmes       for   betterment   of\n             transgenders within a period of six months from today.\n         D. State Government is also directed to create public\n             awareness to enable transgenders to come into the main\n             stream and also to take measures to regain their respect\n             and place in the society.\n         E. State Government is also directed to frame a scheme of\n             housing for transgenders giving suitable accommodation\n             to them within six months from today.\n         F. State Government is also directed to provide financial\n             assistance to parents of transgenders and to give\n                                   - 10 -\n\n\n\n\n           scholarship to transgenders upto post-graduate level in\n           order to assimilate them in the main stream.\n\n      G.   State Government is directed to constitute a welfare\n           board for upliftment of transgenders in State of\n           Uttarakhand, within a period of six months from today.\n           Representation shall be given to transgenders in board.\n\n      H.   State Government is also directed to provide free medical\n           access to transgenders in all the hospitals.\n\n      I.   We also direct that transgenders shall have free access to\n           public institutions, public places, playgrounds, roads\n           including educational institutions, malls, market places,\n           hospitals, hotels, restaurants etc.\n\n      J.   The respondent-State is also directed to provide separate\n           toilets to transgenders in every public utility buildings\n           including hospitals, bus stations, railway stations etc.\n           within a period of six months from today.\n\n      K.   We direct State Government to ensure that no\n           transgender is separated from the parents and family and\n           we also suggest State Government to frame law/scheme\n           to ensure that no transgender is separated from the\n           parents/guardians and family within a period of three\n           months from today.\n\n      L.   Criminal cases shall be registered against persons who\n           forcibly remove transgender from their parents/guardians\n           and family.\n\n      M.   All transgenders in State of Uttarakhand are ordered to\n           be registered by District Magistrates to recognize them as\n           such.\n\n      N.   There shall not be any discrimination to transgenders qua\n           employment or occupation. They should not be treated\n           unfairly. They have absolute right, as enshrined under\n           <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_3\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India to maintain privacy\n           and to live with dignity.&quot;\n\n\n     12.   It was submitted, even if it were contention of\n\nrespondents that number of transgender persons in State was\n\nminimal, High Court of Madras in S. Tamilselvi v. State,\n                                    - 11 -\n\n\n\n\nreported in 2022 SCC OnLine Mad. 4879, issued directions as\n\nfollows:\n\n            &quot;28. Assuming that, the reason cited by the respondents\n            for not giving the special reservation for transgender,\n            because, only minimal transgenders are living in the\n            State and therefore if a particular percentage of seats for\n            transgender category is reserved, sometimes that may\n            not be taken by the transgender for want of candidates is\n            concerned, atleast a provisional note could have been\n            made that, even though special reservation has not been\n            made horizontally for transgender candidates if there is\n            any transgender candidate who makes application and\n            would be otherwise eligible to be considered on merits\n            that is the minimum eligibility mark obtained by the\n            transgender candidate, that candidate would be treated\n            as a special candidate under the special category of\n            transgender or third gender and accordingly transgender\n            candidate would be considered for admission. Atleast this\n            kind of special note could have been appended to the\n            notifications or prospectus issued by the respondent,\n            even that kind of special note was missing in the said\n            notification/prospectus.&quot;\n\n      13.    He also relied on interim order dated 20.06.2023\n\npassed      by   Hon&#x27;ble       High         Court   of     Telangana      in\n\nW.P.no.15117/2023 (Dr.Koyyala Ruth John Pail v. Union\n\nof India). Reliance was also placed on decision of High Court\n\nof   Calcutta    in   WPA      no.9187/2020              disposed   of    on\n\n02.02.2021 (Mx.Sumana Pramanik v. Union of India),\n\nwherei, it was held non-grant of reservation, age relaxation and\n\nfee concession in Joint CSIR-UGC NET Examination was\n\npatently violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_4\">Article 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_5\">21</a> of Constitution of India\n\nand directions issued for provision of same for category of\n\ntransgenders along with other reserved category. It was\n                                - 12 -\n\n\n\n\nsubmitted in view of above, petitioner for granting similar\n\ndirections as in above cases by allowing writ petition.\n\n\n      14.   On other hand, Sri K.G.Raghavan, learned Senior\n\nCounsel appearing for Sri Aditya Narayan, advocate for NLSIU\n\nsought to oppose writ petition. It was submitted, petitioner was\n\nnot entitled either for main or interim reliefs, as Central or\n\nState Governments had not framed any law after decision in\n\nNALSA&#x27;s case (supra).\n\n\n      15.   It was submitted, NLSIU was a premier educational\n\ninstitution in Law offering various courses with fees stipulated\n\nfor each of them commensurate to expenditure involved. It was\n\nsubmitted, selection of students for admission was based on\n\ncumulative score in NLSAT-LLB test and all candidates applying\n\nfor said examination would be well aware of fee structure for\n\neach course at time of filing application. Therefore, being well\n\naware of fee structure, petitioner had appeared for test. Neither\n\nat time of filing application nor at time of appearing for test,\n\npetitioner had expressed any difficulty in so far as fees.\n\n\n      16.   It   was   submitted,   selection   of   candidates   for\n\nadmission to LL.B course by NLSIU was by applying common\n                               - 13 -\n\n\n\n\nyardstick. After results, petitioner was placed at sl.no.62 in\n\norder of merit under general category. Last selected candidate\n\nunder said category was at sl.no.40. Therefore, petitioner did\n\nnot qualify after cut-off. Petitioner was admitted in pursuance\n\nof interim order granted herein.\n\n\n     17.   It was submitted, on selection through NLSAT\n\nexams, candidates were required to file application and pay\n\nfees before being permitted to attend classes. In view of failure\n\nto pay fees, petitioner was not permitted to attend classes. It\n\nwas submitted, as per standards fixed under Rule 12 of Bar\n\nCouncil of India Rules, minimum attendance was mandatory to\n\nbe eligible for LL.B Exams. It was submitted as Course had\n\ncommenced on 21st August, 2023, and without paying fee could\n\nnot be permitted to attend classes, even if petitioner were to\n\ncome forward to pay fees or succeed in this writ petition,\n\npetitioner would not be eligible for Exams. Therefore, petition\n\nwas rendered academic.\n\n\n     18.   It was also submitted, admittedly, petitioner was\n\nemployed    before    admission        to   University.   Therefore,\n\npetitioner&#x27;s claim for financial assistance would not be tenable.\n\nIn any case, University had lent available support to petitioner\n                                          - 14 -\n\n\n\n\nas per existing policies. It had provided Laptop, stipend of\n\nRs.27,000/- and reimbursement of interest on educational loan\n\nfor a period of 3 years.\n\n\n      19.     In reply to contention that NLSIU was inimical to\n\ntransgender persons, it was submitted, NLSIU had adopted\n\nvarious measures for transgender persons to create level\n\nplaying field. As part of its inclusive measures, it was\n\nmaintaining gender neutral toilets, special counseling support\n\nfor students who need gender related or gender transition\n\ncounseling,        implementation          of     gender-neutral     anti-sexual\n\nharassment         code,   encouraging            gender-neutral    salutations,\n\nhosting QAMRA (Queer Archive for Memory Reflection and\n\nActivism), besides being in final stages of formulating a new\n\ngender equality code to respond to all forms of discrimination\n\nand provide inclusive and supportive educational environment.\n\n\n      20.     It    was    submitted,             provisions   of   <a href=\"/doc/189649946/\" id=\"a_6\">Transgender\n\nPersons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019</a>, and Transgender\n\nPersons (Protection of Rights) Rules, 2020, did not mandate or\n\nprovide     reservation      for        transgender       persons    and   only\n\ncontemplated         adoption      of     measures        to   ensure   access,\n                                     - 15 -\n\n\n\n\ninclusiveness and prevent discrimination. It was submitted,\n\nmeasures adopted were far and above requirements of law.\n\n\n        21.   It was submitted, petitioner contends that as per\n\n<a href=\"/doc/21062620/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 10</a> of National Law School of India University Act, 1986,\n\nExecutive Council has power to prescribe reservation in\n\nadmissions. Therefore, unless decision is taken by Executive\n\nCouncil,      University     cannot          prescribe   reservation        for\n\ntransgender. To substantiate submission, reliance was placed\n\non decision in Master Balachandar Krishnan v. State of\n\nKarnataka, reported in ILR 2021 Kar. 1245, wherein it was\n\nheld:\n\n         &quot;196. In view of the above, we arrive at the following\n              conclusions:\n\n         (1) The role of BCI, BCI Trust and the Society in the\n             establishment and functioning of the respondent/Law\n             School is significant and pervasive and the respondent-\n             State has been only a facilitator in granting the\n             respondent/Law School deemed University status through\n             the Act.\n\n         (2) The State Legislature has no power or authority under the\n             Act to direct the respondent/Law School to provide\n             reservations for students in view of the limited role of the\n             State under the Act. Hence, the impugned Amendment by\n             insertion of sub-Section (3) of <a href=\"/doc/85243365/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 4</a> of the Act is\n             declared illegal.\n\n\n         (3) The impugned Amendment in sub-Section (3) of <a href=\"/doc/85243365/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 4</a>\n             of the Act is contrary to the scheme of the Act and powers\n             vested in the authorities recognized under the Act which\n             makes the respondent/Law School an autonomous and\n             independent body free from State&#x27;s control. Hence, the\n                             - 16 -\n\n\n\n\n      impugned Amendment which encroaches upon the power\n      of the authorities under the Act is contrary to the Act.\n\n\n(4) Clause 2.1 of the Notification dated 04.08.2020 issued by\n    the     respondent/Law     School   providing   horizontal\n    reservation to an extent of 25% of the total seats by a\n    revised seat matrix by following the aforesaid amendment\n    is illegal and hence quashed.\n\n(5) Further, the respondent/Law School has no authority to\n    award 5% concession of marks on the last cut off score in\n    the General merit category for the &quot;students of\n    Karnataka&quot; as defined in the explanation to the Amending\n    Section and hence, Clause 2.2 of the Notification dated\n    04.08.2020 is quashed.\n\n(6)    Recognising the fact that respondent/Law School in an\n      autonomous entity, any form of reservation for students\n      to be admitted to it shall be provided by the Executive\n      Council of the Law School bearing in mind the fact that it\n      is an institution of national importance.\n\n(7) The category of students namely &quot;Students of Karnataka&quot;\n    for whom reservation horizontally to an extent of 25% of\n    the seats has been made has no nexus to the objects\n    sought to be achieved and is hence, in violation of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_10\">Article\n    14</a> of the Constitution.\n\n(8) Further, institutional preference being the basis of\n    reservation and the criteria mentioned in the explanation\n    to the impugned amendment in sub-Section (3) to\n    <a href=\"/doc/85243365/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 4</a> of the Act to identify the beneficiary namely,\n    &quot;students of Karnataka&quot; cannot be operationalised in its\n    present form.\n\n(9) However, we clarify that the increase in the intake\n    capacity made by the respondent/Law School by Clause\n    (1) of Notification dated 04.08.2020 is not interfered\n    with. But, the revised seat matrix incorporating the\n    impugned reservation is quashed.\n\n(10) The respondent/Consortium shall publish the results of\n    the CLAT examination in terms of reservation made prior\n    to the impugned amendment bearing in mind the\n    increase in the intake capacity insofar as respondent/Law\n    School is concerned.\n                                  - 17 -\n\n\n\n\n      (11) Consequently, the respondent/Law School shall follow\n          the seat matrix issued de hors the impugned reservation\n          for students of Karnataka, bearing in mind the increased\n          intake capacity and the reservation made for the\n          Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and for persons\n          with disability.\n\n      (12) I.A. No. 1 of 2020 in Writ Petition No. 8788 of 2020\n          is disposed of. Applicant in the said I. A. in Writ Petition\n          No. 8788 of 2020 is permitted as an intervenor in these\n          proceedings. But, I. A. No. 2 of 2020 in Writ Petition No.\n          8788 of 2020, I.A. No. 1 of 2020 in Writ Petition No. 8951\n          of 2020 and I.A. No. 1 of 2020 in Writ Petition No. 9145\n          of 2020 by the applicants are dismissed. The above is by\n          separate order.\n\n      (13) Writ Petition No. 8788 of 2020 filed by a student who\n          had applied pursuant to the notification issued on\n          01.01.2020 by the respondent/Consortium to appear in\n          CLAT is allowed and disposed in the aforesaid manner.\n\n      (14) Writ Petition No. 8951 of 2020 and 9145 of 2020 are\n          allowed in the aforesaid terms.&quot;\n\n\n     22.   To support submission that there cannot be a\n\nprayer for providing reservation, reliance was placed on\n\ndecision in case of State of Punjab v. Anshika Goyal,\n\nreported in (2022) 3 SCC 633:\n\n      &quot;9. While answering the aforesaid issue, few decisions of this\n          Court referred to hereinabove are required to be\n          discussed:\n\n      9.1. In Gulshan Prakash v. State of Haryana, (2010) 1 SCC\n           477, it was observed by this Court that there cannot be\n           any mandamus by the Court to provide for a reservation\n           for a particular community. In the case before this Court,\n           the State of Haryana did not provide any reservation for\n           SC/ST/backward community at the postgraduate level. A\n           conscious decision was taken by the State of Haryana not\n           to provide for reservation at the postgraduate level. The\n           same was challenged and to that this Court has observed\n           that there cannot be any mandamus by the Court as\n           claimed. In the aforesaid decision, it was further observed\n           and held that <a href=\"/doc/251667/\" id=\"a_12\">Article 15(4)</a> of the Constitution is an\n                            - 18 -\n\n\n\n\n    enabling provision and the State Government is the best\n    Judge to grant reservation for SC/ST/backward categories\n    at postgraduate level. Any policy and the decision of the\n    State not to make any provision for reservation at\n    postgraduate level suffers from no infirmity. It was\n    further observed that every State can take its own\n    decision with regard to reservation depending on various\n    factors. At this stage, it is to be noted that it was also\n    submitted before this Court that since the Government\n    has decided to grant reservation for SC/ST/backward\n    class communities in admission at MBBS level i.e.\n    undergraduate level and therefore the State has to\n    provide for reservation at postgraduate level also. To\n    that, this Court observed that since the Government had\n    decided to grant reservation for SC/ST/backward\n    categories in admission at MBBS level i.e. undergraduate\n    level, it does not mean that it is bound to grant\n    reservation at the postgraduate level also.\n\n9.2. In Central Bank of India v. SC/ST Employees Welfare\n     Assn. [Central Bank of India v. SC/ST Employees Welfare\n     Assn., (2015) 12 SCC 308] , while considering the issue\n     of providing reservation in favour of SC/ST category\n     persons in the promotion and when <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_13\">Articles 15</a> and <a href=\"/doc/211089/\" id=\"a_14\">16</a> of\n     the Constitution of India were pressed into service, this\n     Court observed and held that though <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_15\">Articles 15</a> and <a href=\"/doc/211089/\" id=\"a_16\">16</a>\n     empower the State to take an affirmative action in favour\n     of the SC/ST category persons by making reservations for\n     them in the employment of the Union or the State, they\n     are only enabling provisions which permit the State to\n     make provision for reservation of these category of\n     persons. It was further observed that insofar as making\n     of provisions for reservation in matters of promotion to\n     any class/classes of post is concerned, such a provision\n     can be made in favour of SC/ST category employees if in\n     the opinion of the State they are not adequately\n     represented in services under the State. It is observed\n     that therefore power lies with the State to make a\n     provision but, at the same time, courts cannot issue any\n     mandamus to the State to necessarily make such a\n     provision. In para 26, it was observed and held as under :\n     (SCC p. 325)\n         &quot;26. In the first instance, we make it clear that there\n         is no dispute about the constitutional position\n         envisaged in <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_17\">Articles 15</a> and <a href=\"/doc/211089/\" id=\"a_18\">16</a>, insofar as these\n         provisions empower the State to take affirmative\n         action in favour of SC/ST category persons by making\n         reservations for them in the employment in the Union\n         or    the   State    (or   for  that   matter,   public\n         sector/authorities which are treated as State under\n         <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_19\">Article 12</a> of the Constitution). The laudable objective\n                            - 19 -\n\n\n\n\n        underlying these provisions is also to be kept in mind\n        while undertaking any exercise pertaining to the\n        issues touching upon the reservation of such SC/ST\n        employees. Further, such a reservation can not only\n        be made at the entry level but is permissible in the\n        matters of promotions as well. At the same time, it is\n        also to be borne in mind that clauses (4) and (4-A) of\n        <a href=\"/doc/211089/\" id=\"a_20\">Article 16</a> of the Constitution are only the enabling\n        provisions which permit the State to make provision\n        for reservation of these category of persons. Insofar\n        as making of provisions for reservation in matters of\n        promotion to any class or classes of post is concerned,\n        such a provision can be made in favour of SC/ST\n        category employees if, in the opinion of the State,\n        they are not adequately represented in services under\n        the State. Thus, no doubt, power lies with the State to\n        make a provision, but, at the same time, courts\n        cannot issue any mandamus to the State to\n        necessarily make such a provision. It is for the State\n        to act, in a given situation, and to take such an\n        affirmative action. Of course, whenever there exists\n        such a provision for reservation in the matters of\n        recruitment or the promotion, it would bestow an\n        enforceable right in favour of persons belonging to\n        SC/ST category and on failure on the part of any\n        authority to reserve the posts, while making\n        selections/promotions, the beneficiaries of these\n        provisions can approach the Court to get their rights\n        enforced. What is to be highlighted is that existence of\n        provision for reservation in the matter of selection or\n        promotion, as the case may be, is the sine qua non\n        for seeking mandamus as it is only when such a\n        provision is made by the State, a right shall accrue in\n        favour of SC/ST candidates and not otherwise.&quot;\n\n9.3. In Suresh Chand Gautam [Suresh Chand Gautam v. State\n     of U.P., (2016) 11 SCC 113] , writ petitions were\n     preferred before this Court under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_21\">Article 32</a> of the\n     Constitution of India for issuance of a direction in the\n     nature of a mandamus commanding the State/States to\n     enforce appropriately the constitutional mandate as\n     contained under the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/137418340/\" id=\"a_22\">Articles 16(4-A)</a><a href=\"/doc/168594624/\" id=\"a_23\">, 16(4-\n     B)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1113850/\" id=\"a_24\">335</a> of the Constitution, or in the alternative,\n     directing the respondents to constitute a committee or\n     appoint a commission chaired either by a retired Judge of\n     the High Court or the Supreme Court in making survey\n     and collecting necessary qualitative data of the Scheduled\n     Castes and the Scheduled Tribes in the services of the\n     State for granting reservation in promotion in the light of\n     direction given by this Court in M.Nagaraj v. Union of\n     India [M. Nagaraj v. Union of India, (2006) 8 SCC 212] .\n                        - 20 -\n\n\n\n\nRefusing to grant such reliefs in exercise of powers under\n<a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_25\">Article 32</a> of the Constitution of India and after referring\nto the decision of this Court in Census Commr. v. R.\nKrishnamurthy [Census       Commr. v. R.    Krishnamurthy,\n(2015) 2 SCC 796] , this Court has observed that no writ\nof mandamus of such a nature can be issued. While\nrefusing to issue a writ of mandamus of such a nature, in\npara 49, it was observed and held as under : (Suresh\nChand Gautam case [Suresh Chand Gautam v. State of\nU.P., (2016) 11 SCC 113], SCC pp. 145-46):\n\n   &quot;49.        Recently        in Census      Commr. v. R.\n   Krishnamurthy [Census Commr. v. R. Krishnamurthy,\n   (2015) 2 SCC 796] a three-Judge Bench while dealing\n   with    the     correctness    of  the   judgment     [R.\n   Krishnamurthy v. Census Commr., WP No. 10090 of\n   2010, decided on 12-5-2010 (Mad)] of the High Court\n   wherein the High Court had directed that the Census\n   Department of the Government of India shall take\n   such measures towards conducting the caste-wise\n   census in the country at the earliest and in a time-\n   bound manner, so as to achieve the goal of social\n   justice in its true sense, which is the need of the hour,\n   the court analysing the context opined thus : (R.\n   Krishnamurthy           case [Census       Commr. v. R.\n   Krishnamurthy, (2015) 2 SCC 796], SCC p. 806, para\n   25)\n        &quot;25. Interference with the policy decision and\n        issue of a mandamus to frame a policy in a\n        particular manner are absolutely different. <a href=\"/doc/189649946/\" id=\"a_26\">The\n        Act</a> has conferred power on the Central\n        Government to issue notification regarding the\n        manner in which the census has to be carried out\n        and the Central Government has issued\n        notifications, and the competent authority has\n        issued directions. It is not within the domain of\n        the court to legislate. The courts do interpret the\n        law and in such interpretation certain creative\n        process is involved. The courts have the\n        jurisdiction to declare the law as unconstitutional.\n        That too, where it is called for. The court may\n        also fill up the gaps in certain spheres applying\n        the doctrine of constitutional silence or abeyance.\n        But the courts are not to plunge into policy-\n        making by adding something to the policy by way\n        of issuing a writ of mandamus.&#x27;\n\n        We have referred to the said authority in Census\n        Commr.           case [Census        Commr. v. R.\n        Krishnamurthy, (2015) 2 SCC 796 : (2015) 1 SCC\n        (L&amp;S) 589] as the Court has clearly held that it\n        neither legislates nor does it issue a mandamus\n                             - 21 -\n\n\n\n\n            to legislate. The relief in the present case, when\n            appositely appreciated, tantamounts to a prayer\n            for issue of a mandamus to take a step towards\n            framing of a rule or a regulation for the purpose\n            of reservation for the Scheduled Castes and the\n            Scheduled Tribes in matter of promotions. In our\n            considered opinion, a writ of mandamus of such a\n            nature cannot be issued.&quot;\n\n9.4. In the recent decision in Mukesh Kumar [Mukesh\n     Kumar v. State of Uttarakhand, (2020) 3 SCC 1] , again it\n     is reiterated by this Court that no mandamus can be\n     issued by the Court directing the State Government to\n     provide for reservation. It was further observed that even\n     no writ of mandamus can be issued directing the State to\n     collect quantifiable data to justify their action not to\n     provide for reservation. It was observed that even if the\n     under-representation of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled\n     Tribes in public services is brought to the notice of the\n     Court, no mandamus can be issued by the Court to the\n     State Government to provide for reservation. While\n     holding so, in para 18, it was observed and held as under\n     : (SCC pp. 12-13)\n         &quot;18. The direction that was issued to the State\n         Government to collect quantifiable data pertaining to\n         the adequacy or inadequacy of representation of\n         persons belonging to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled\n         Tribes in government services is the subject-matter of\n         challenge in some appeals before us. In view of the\n         law laid down by this Court, there is no doubt that the\n         State Government is not bound to make reservations.\n         There is no fundamental right which inheres in an\n         individual to claim reservation in promotions. No\n         mandamus can be issued by the Court directing the\n         State Government to provide reservations. It is\n         abundantly clear from the judgments of this Court\n         in Indra Sawhney [Indra Sawhney v. Union of India,\n         1992 Supp (3) SCC 217] , Ajit Singh (2) [Ajit Singh\n         (2) v. State of Punjab, (1999) 7 SCC 209], M.\n         Nagaraj [M. Nagaraj v. Union of India, (2006) 8 SCC\n         212] and Jarnail Singh [Jarnail Singh v. Lachhmi\n         Narain Gupta, (2018) 10 SCC 396] that <a href=\"/doc/68038/\" id=\"a_27\">Articles 16(4)</a>\n         and <a href=\"/doc/137418340/\" id=\"a_28\">16(4-A)</a> are enabling provisions and the collection\n         of   quantifiable    data    showing    inadequacy    of\n         representation of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled\n         Tribes in public service is a sine qua non for providing\n         reservations in promotions. The data to be collected\n         by the State Government is only to justify reservation\n         to be made in the matter of appointment or promotion\n         to public posts, according to <a href=\"/doc/68038/\" id=\"a_29\">Articles 16(4)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/137418340/\" id=\"a_30\">16(4-\n         A)</a> of the Constitution. As such, collection of data\n                           - 22 -\n\n\n\n\n       regarding the inadequate representation of members\n       of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, as\n       noted above, is a prerequisite for providing\n       reservations, and is not required when the State\n       Government decided not to provide reservations. Not\n       being bound to provide reservations in promotions,\n       the State is not required to justify its decision on the\n       basis of quantifiable data, showing that there is\n       adequate representation of members of the Scheduled\n       Castes and Scheduled Tribes in State services. Even if\n       the under-representation of Scheduled Castes and\n       Scheduled Tribes in public services is brought to the\n       notice of this Court, no mandamus can be issued by\n       this Court to the State Government to provide\n       reservation in light of the law laid down by this Court\n       in C.A. Rajendran [C.A. Rajendran v. Union of India,\n       AIR 1968 SC 507] and Suresh Chand Gautam [Suresh\n       Chand Gautam v. State of U.P., (2016) 11 SCC 113].\n       Therefore, the direction given by the High Court that\n       the State Government should first collect data\n       regarding     the    adequacy     or    inadequacy    of\n       representation of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled\n       Tribes in government services on the basis of which\n       the State Government should take a decision whether\n       or not to provide reservation in promotion is contrary\n       to the law laid down by this Court and is accordingly\n       set aside. Yet another direction given by the High\n       Court in its judgment dated 15-7-2019 [Vinod\n       Kumar v. State of Uttarakhand, 2019 SCC OnLine Utt\n       1536], directing that all future vacancies that are to\n       be filled up by promotion in the posts of Assistant\n       Engineer, should only be from the members of\n       Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, is wholly\n       unjustifiable and is hence set aside.&quot;\n\n10. Applying the law laid down by this Court in the aforesaid\n    decisions to the facts of the case on hand, we are of the\n    opinion that the High Court has committed a grave error\n    in issuing a writ of mandamus and directing the State\n    Government to provide for 3% reservation/quota for\n    sportspersons, instead of 1% as provided by the State\n    Government. A conscious policy decision was taken by\n    the     State   Government      to   provide   for    1%\n    reservation/quota for sportspersons. A specific Order\n    dated 25-7-2019 was also issued by the State\n    Government. Therefore, the High Court has exceeded its\n    jurisdiction while issuing a writ of mandamus directing\n    the State to provide a particular percentage of\n    reservation for sportspersons, namely, in the present\n    case, 3% reservation instead of 1% provided by the State\n    Government, while exercising powers under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_31\">Article 226</a> of\n                                   - 23 -\n\n\n\n\n           the Constitution of India. Therefore, the impugned\n           common judgment and order [Anshika Goyal v. State of\n           Punjab, 2019 SCC OnLine P&amp;H 6235] passed by the High\n           Court insofar as directing the State to provide for 3%\n           reservation for sportspersons and/or provide for a sports\n           quota of 3% in the government medical/dental colleges is\n           unsustainable and the same deserves to be quashed and\n           set aside.&quot;\n\n\n     23.   It was further submitted attempt to nullify selection\n\nprocess for admission in NLSIU by referring to direction issued\n\nin NALSA&#x27;s case (supra) would not stand legal scrutiny as such\n\nprayer in absence of steps by State have been held untenable\n\nin Matam Gangabhavani v. State of A.P., reported in 2022\n\nSCC OnLine AP 200, as follows:\n\n           &quot;54. One of the contentions of the petitioner is that,\n           when the petitioner is a transgender and the Hon&#x27;ble\n           Supreme Court issued guidelines in National Legal\n           Services Authority v. Union of India (referred supra) to\n           take steps to provide reservations to transgenders in\n           employment directing the Centre and State Governments\n           to take steps to treat the transgenders as Socially and\n           Educationally backward Classes of citizens and extend all\n           kinds of reservation in cases of admission in educational\n           institutions and for public appointments. Thus, the\n           direction is only to take steps to provide all kinds of\n           reservation in case of admission in educational\n           institutions and in public appointments, treating them as\n           Socially and Educationally backward Classes of citizens.\n           But,     social  reservations    are   vertical,   whereas,\n           reservations based on gender are horizontal. If, the\n           reservations are provided treating this petitioner as\n           socially and educationally backward, the present\n           reservations if taken together, it exceeds more than 50%.\n           In India, the extent of reservation to be made is primarily\n           a matter for the State to decide, subject, of course, to\n           judicial review of equality in <a href=\"/doc/250697/\" id=\"a_32\">Article 16(1)</a> or <a href=\"/doc/1113850/\" id=\"a_33\">Article 335</a>\n           meaningless. Thus, the reservation of more than 50 per\n           cent of the vacancies as they arise in any year or a &#x27;carry\n           forward&#x27; rule which has the same effect, will be outside\n           the protection of <a href=\"/doc/68038/\" id=\"a_34\">Article 16(4).</a> The normal rule is that the\n           reservation under <a href=\"/doc/68038/\" id=\"a_35\">Article 16(4)</a> should not exceed 50 per\n                             - 24 -\n\n\n\n\n    cent of the appointments or posts to be made in a\n    particular year. Taking consideration of the fact situation\n    prevailing in the State on the reservations, it is for the\n    State to take appropriate action in terms of the directions\n    issued by the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court in Para 135.3\n    of National    Legal    Services    Authority v. Union     of\n    India (referred supra).\n    .........\n75. No     doubt,     no    reservation     is    provided    to\n    transgenders/transmale/transfemale, but direction was\n    issued by the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court in National Legal\n    Services Authority v. Union of India (referred supra) to\n    both Centre and the State Governments to take steps to\n    treat them as Socially and Educationally backward\n    Classes of citizens and extend all kinds of reservation in\n    cases of admission in educational institutions and for\n    public appointments. Therefore, the direction issued by\n    the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court is only to the extent of taking\n    steps to treat transgenders as socially and educationally\n    backward classes of citizens, but not for creating\n    reserving particular percentage of posts to transgenders.\n    Therefore, as on date, no steps were taken by the State\n    Government for creating reservation to transgenders on\n    the basis of their social and educational backwardness\n    (vertical reservation), but, based on the subsisting rules\n    of reservation in the State services, the notification\n    impugned in the writ petition was issued. When the\n    Notification was issued strictly adhering to the subsisting\n    rules, the notification cannot be declared as illegal and\n    arbitrary. Even to construe that the second respondent\n    violated the direction issued by the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court\n    in National    Legal    Services    Authority v. Union     of\n    India (referred supra), the direction is only to take steps\n    for providing reservation to transgenders based on their\n    social and educational backwardness. Though, it appears\n    to be in the nature of directions, the State is under the\n    obligation to implement it, they did not take any steps till\n    date. After the judgment of Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court\n    in National    Legal    Services    Authority v. Union     of\n    India (referred    supra),   the    <a href=\"/doc/189649946/\" id=\"a_36\">Transgender      Persons\n    (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019</a> was enacted by the\n    Central Government and Rules were framed thereunder,\n    but, none of these Acts provided any reservation to\n    transgenders, except providing access to employment.\n    Therefore, in the absence of any steps taken by the\n    State, failure of its instrumentalities to provide\n    reservation to transgenders does not make the\n    notification impugned in this writ petition invalid. Hence, I\n    find no ground to declare the notification impugned in this\n    writ petition as illegal or arbitrary, in view of the\n    judgment of the Apex Court in National Legal Services\n                                   - 25 -\n\n\n\n\n           Authority v. Union of India (referred supra) to take steps\n           to provide reservation to transgenders, more particularly,\n           no steps were taken till date. At best, such failure may\n           attract contempt being filed before the competent court,\n           but this Court cannot declare such Notification as illegal\n           and arbitrary, on the basis of such contention. Hence, I\n           find no ground to grant the above relief, while rejecting\n           the contention of this petitioner. Accordingly, Point nos.1\n           &amp; 2 are answered.\n\n\n     24.    It was submitted, since petitioner had applied and\n\nappeared in entrance Exams, without invoking claim for\n\nreservation in favour of TGs, petitioner would be estopped from\n\nquestioning selection process after participation, by relying on\n\ndecision in case of Sweety Nagar v. State of Haryana,\n\nreported in 2022 SCC OnLine P&amp;H 91, wherein it is held:\n\n       &quot;7. The petitioner having applied for the post of LDC, it is not\n           believable that she did not know that her application had\n           been submitted as a General category candidate and not\n           under BCB category. The reasoning given by her that she\n           belongs to rural area, where the application forms are\n           submitted online by Computer Operators and the\n           Computer Operator had inadvertently submitted her\n           application under General Category instead of under BCB\n           category, is least convincing. The petitioner having\n           applied as a General category candidate, taken up the\n           written examination as such besides participating in the\n           process for scrutiny of documents, it is not believable that\n           she did so without realizing that she was appearing as a\n           General category candidate and not a candidate\n           belonging to BCB category. She could not be so naive and\n           simpleton so as to act in such a manner. Her\n           representation for change of category was rightly\n           rejected. The order dated 13.7.2021 passed in that\n           regard is quite detailed and well reasoned and no ground\n           is made out to take a different view in the matter. In the\n           order, the factual and judicial position on the subject has\n           been discussed, while concluding that no change of\n           category can be allowed at this stage. It has been\n           specifically mentioned that in the advertisement for the\n           posts, terms and conditions of recruitment process were\n           clearly mentioned advising the candidates to go through\n                        - 26 -\n\n\n\n\nthe same carefully before filling up the online application\nform and then to check up the filled up application form\nto ensure the correctness of information and uploaded\ndocuments before finally submitting the application. It is\nclearly mentioned that no request for change of any\nparticular of the application form would be entertained by\nthe HSSC. It was also informed that in case the candidate\nfeels that he/she has filled up the form erroneously, then\nhe or she should fill up a fresh online application form\nalong with fresh requisite fee before the closing date. The\ncandidates applying under SC/BCA/BCB etc. categories\nwere required to upload supporting certificate from\ncompetent authority and submit the same when called\nupon to do so by HSSC. The petitioner had admittedly not\nuploaded BCB certificate what to talk of applying under\nthat category. It was further mentioned in the\nadvertisement that during scrutiny of documents only\nthose documents, which were uploaded by the candidate\nwould be considered. In this case, the petitioner had not\nuploaded her BCB certificate, therefore, the same could\nnot be taken into consideration. In the order, judgment\npassed by this Court with regard to category change in\nCWP No. 15110-2016 titled as Shashi v. State of\nHaryana decided on 22.5.2018 has been referred to and\noperative part thereof has been reproduced, which is as\nunder:\n     Perusal of the advertisement (Annexure P-1) clearly\n     shows that a candidate can apply only once for a\n     particular category of post advertised. It also makes\n     it clear that no offline form is to be accepted. Another\n     condition included in the advertisement is that\n     incomplete application form would be rejected. Thus,\n     a candidate is required to be very circumspect while\n     filling the application. Although the petitioner may\n     have obtained the EBPG certificate before the\n     extended date of submitting applications, she cannot\n     take benefit thereof as she had applied under the\n     general category. Had she applied for the EBPG\n     category and had failed to attach the certificate\n     alongwith the application, the case may have been\n     different. The Division Bench judgment of this Court\n     in Usha Dhillon (supra) does not support the case of\n     the petitioner as in the said case the computer had\n     committed a mistake and the same was permitted to\n     be corrected. The judgment of the Supreme Court\n     in J&amp;K Public Service Commission (supra) makes it\n     clear that once a candidate has chosen a particular\n     category, he cannot change the same at a later date.\n\n.........\n                                    - 27 -\n\n\n\n\n       10. In the order, it has been mentioned that final result has\n            been declared on 3.4.2021, that means the selection\n            process is over. If the writ petition is accepted that would\n            unsettle the entire process. The petitioner herself having\n            applied under the General category and taken part in the\n            selection process as a General category candidate,\n            however, being unsuccessful to get sufficient marks,\n            wants to change the category to BCB for getting herself\n            selected. Such type of hopping of category in such a\n            manner can certainly be not allowed. As regards, the\n            judgment referred to by learned counsel for the petitioner\n            i.e. Asif Ali Khan v. State of Rajasthan, S.B. Civil Writ\n            Petition No. 9455/2019, that had different facts. As per\n            the facts of that case, the category indicated at the time\n            of filling up online application form was by mistake and\n            the petitioner had not taken any advantage of the same\n            and when the mistake was detected, he was permitted to\n            change the category so as to take the type test and final\n            result had not been declared in that case. However, here\n            the plea taken up by the petitioner that the category\n            indicated at the time of filling up of online application\n            form as General was by mistake has not been found to\n            plausible and convincing. The petitioner had taken up the\n            test and participated in the election process as a General\n            category candidate, the final result in the matter has\n            since been declared, therefore, the petitioner has not\n            been found entitled to change her category to BCB so as\n            to take advantage of reservation.&quot;\n\n\n      25.   For similar proposition, reliance was also placed on\n\ndecisions in case of J &amp; K Public Service Commission v.\n\nIsrar Ahmad, reported in (2005) 12 SCC 498 and on\n\nRajasthan v. Neetu Harsh, reported in (2021) 11 SCC 383.\n\n\n      26.   In any case, plea for financial assistance was not\n\nsupported by pleadings or prayer. Therefore, same cannot be\n\nurged during arguments. It was submitted, in view of above,\n\nwrit petition lacked merit and sought for its dismissal.\n                               - 28 -\n\n\n\n\n     27.   Smt.Mamata Shetty, learned Additional Government\n\nAdvocate appearing for respondent no.1 - State submitted\n\npetitioner herein was seeking admission to 3 years LL.B. Course\n\nat NLSIU under transgender quota by seeking for direction for\n\nfixation of quota for Transgenders, after having applied and\n\nfailed at securing admission under GM category. Petitioner is\n\nblaming his failure on respondents by alleging failure to fully\n\nimplement provisions of <a href=\"/doc/189649946/\" id=\"a_37\">Transgender Persons (Protection of\n\nRights) Act, 2019</a>, and Transgender Persons (Protection of\n\nRights) Rules of 2020.\n\n\n     28.   Though, petitioner was alleging respondents no.1\n\nand 2 had failed to implement TG Policy. But, said policy did\n\nnot contemplate any enforceable right. Therefore, allegation\n\nagainst non-implementation would be untenable.\n\n\n     29.   Insofar as prayer for fixation of reservation in\n\nfavour of transgenders, for admission in NLSIU, it was\n\nsubmitted, in view of decision by Division Bench of this Hon&#x27;ble\n\nCourt, in Master Balachandar Krishnan&#x27;s case (supra),\n\nwherein it was held, State has a limited role under NLSIU Act,\n\nas NLSIU was an autonomous and independent body free from\n\ncontrol of State Government. It was submitted order of Division\n                                - 29 -\n\n\n\n\nBench was subject matter of SLP (C) no.14508-14510/2020\n\nand pending consideration before Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court.\n\nTherefore, at this juncture, State could not prescribe any\n\nreservation in favour of transgenders.\n\n\n     30.    It was however submitted, State Government was\n\ntaking steps to implement <a href=\"/doc/189649946/\" id=\"a_38\">Transgender Persons (Protection of\n\nRights) Act, 2019</a>, as well as Transgender Persons (Protection\n\nof Rights) Rules of 2020 throughout State of Karnataka. It was\n\nsubmitted, State Government had notified Karnataka Civil\n\nServices (General Recruitment) (Amendment) Rules, 2021 on\n\n06.07.2021 providing horizontal reservation for transgender\n\npersons in public employment under sub-rule (1D) of Rule 9 of\n\nKarnataka Civil Services (General Recruitment) Rules, 1977.\n\nFor said reasons, sought dismissal of writ petition.\n\n\n     31.    By filing rejoinder statement, petitioner sought to\n\ncontrovert assertion by respondent University that petitioner\n\nwas seeking to introduce different cause by filing application for\n\namendment. It was submitted, requirement of need for\n\nfinancial aid was existing due to factors such as homelessness,\n\ndisownment by family, extended period of unemployment,\n\nrampant discrimination in employment and in public life\n                                - 30 -\n\n\n\n\nassociated with TGs. It was submitted, details of financial aid\n\npolicy of NLSIU were not in public domain. Infact only after\n\nreceipt of admission letter and deposit of Rs.50,000/- raised\n\nthrough loans and when petitioner was unable to arrange for\n\nremaining   amount    of   fees,   petitioner   requested   financial\n\nassistance that financial aid policy was made available.\n\n\n     32.    Only then, it was noted that policy does not\n\ncontemplate circumstances affecting TGs nor was it flexible, but\n\nmore in nature of providing information to avail loan. Thus,\n\nadmission process of NLSIU was insensitive to specific needs of\n\nTGs, which would be violative of guarantees under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_39\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_40\">,\n\n15</a><a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_41\">, 19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_42\">21</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/1673816/\" id=\"a_43\">Article 38</a><a href=\"/doc/555882/\" id=\"a_44\">, 39</a> and <a href=\"/doc/352126/\" id=\"a_45\">46</a> of Constitution of\n\nIndia, 1950.

It was submitted rights of TGs to study law was not\n\nonly affected by failure to provide reservation as directed in\n\nNALSA case, but also compounded by stipulating need for filing\n\naffidavit undertaking that admission would be subject to\n\noutcome of decision in W.P.no.1023/2016 pending before\n\nSupreme Court insisted upon by KSLU. On importance of right\n\nto education, especially legal education, petitioner relied on\n\nobservation of High Court of Kerala in Pattaka Suresh Babu\n                                 - 32 -\n\n\n\n\nv. State of Kerala &amp; Ors. (2023) in Crl.M.A.no.3/2023 in\n\nCrl.Appeal no.740/2018:\n\n     &quot;9.    Education is the most potent mechanism for the\n     advancement of an individual. International treaties\n     specify the aims of education as promoting personal\n     development and respect for human rights and freedoms,\n     enabling individuals to participate effectively in a free\n     society and fostering understanding, friendship and\n     tolerance. The right to education has been formally\n     recognized as a human right in the Universal Declaration\n     of Human Rights in 1948 and has since been affirmed in\n     global human rights treaties, including the 1960 United\n     Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization\n     (UNESCO) Convention Against Discrimination in Education\n     and the 1966 International Convenant on Economic,\n     Social and Cultural Rights, <a href=\"/doc/1010805/\" id=\"a_46\">Article 13(1)</a> of which\n     recognizes &#x27;the right of everyone to education&#x27;.\n\n     10.     ....The prisoners&#x27; right to education is a human right\n     grounded in the right to dignity. A prisoner has as much a\n     right to pursue study as a person free from the confines\n     of jail. The aims of imprisonment include reformation and\n     rehabilitation apart from deterrence. Education can\n     contribute to a sense among prisoners that they remain a\n     part of the wider community.\n\n\n     34.   Insofar as stand of University that it has taken\n\naffirmative action to remove un-equalities and as its own\n\nreservation policy and financial aid policy, but same cannot be\n\nfaulted merely on ground that they do not specifically cater to\n\npetitioner request. In this regard reliance was placed on\n\ndecision of S.Tharika Banu case (supra):\n\n     &quot;9.    ....Instead of living normal stigmatic life as a\n     transgender (person) and in spite of undergoing various\n     insults and even assaults, harassments in the hands of\n     some unruly elements, when they come forward to get\n     education, the same has to be encouraged and based on\n                                 - 33 -\n\n\n\n\n     technicalities, the transgender persons coming forward to\n     join educational institutions should not be driven out.\n\n     10.    The legal status of Transgender persons emanates\n     from the judgment of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in\n     National Legal Services Authority v. Union of India and\n     others reported in 2014(5) SCC 438. Before the said\n     judgment, the transgenders did not have any recognition\n     even as human being as they have been undergoing\n     insults, assaults, harassments both psychologically and\n     physiologivally. Their pain, agony and suffering have not\n     been felt by others and their plight have not been\n     recognized by any of the parties. It is only the Court\n     which has taken care of the transgenders and gave\n     appropriate directions in the year 2014.&quot;\n\n\n\n     35.   It was submitted, in W.P.no.6967/2022 disposed\n\nof on 08.04.2024 (Rakshika Raj v. State of Tamil Nadu and\n\nOrs.) and in WP no.27090/2024 disposed of on 11.09.2024\n\n(A. Nivetha v. Secy. to Govt. (Health and Family Welfare\n\nDepartment), High Court of Madras upheld need for horizontal\n\nreservation for TGs. It was submitted, failure to provide\n\nreservation for TGs as directed in NALSA&#x27;s case (supra) entitled\n\npetitioner for issuance of positive directions as done by High\n\nCourt of Calcutta in WPA no.21508/2023 disposed of on\n\n14.06.2024 (Mrinal Barik v. State of WB and Ors.), where in\n\nexercise   of   extraordinary      jurisdiction   conferred   under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_47\">Article 226</a> of CoI, Secretary, West Bengal Board of Primary\n\nEducation was directed to arrange for interview and counseling\n                                  - 34 -\n\n\n\n\nof petitioner therein as a special case and recruit her as an\n\nAssistant Teacher in primary section, by appropriate relaxation.\n\n\n         36.   In view of above, since NLSIU had failed to provide\n\nreservation for TGs and absence of measures of providing\n\nfinancial assistance would render such reservation nugatory,\n\npetitioner     prayed   for   allowing    writ   petition   by   issuing\n\nappropriate positive directions.\n\n         37.   Heard learned counsel and perused writ petition\n\nrecords.\n\n\n         38.   From above, petitioner&#x27;s grievance in this writ\n\npetition appears to be two fold; firstly, inaction of respondents\n\nto provide reservation for TGs in admission to Courses of study\n\noffered by NLSIU and secondly, inaction to provide financial\n\nassistance to TGs for pursuing studies (in case of petitioner,\n\nsince Rs.50,000/- was paid, for waiver sought for remainder of\n\nfees).\n\n\n         39.   Claim for reservation in favour of TGs stems from\n\nfollowing directions in NALSA&#x27;s case (supra):\n\n         &quot;135.3. We direct the Centre and the State Governments\n                 to take steps to treat them as Socially and\n                 Educationally Backward Classes of citizens and\n                 extend all kinds of reservation in cases of\n                                   - 35 -\n\n\n\n\n               admission in educational institutions and for\n               public appointments.\n                                        (emphasis supplied)\n\n     40.     And in Rano&#x27;s case (supra):\n\n       B.    Directing State Government to provide reservation\n             in admission in educational institutions and public\n             appointments to TGs by framing scheme within six\n             months;\n                                               (emphasis supplied)\n\n\n     41.     And    in Mx.Sumana           Pramanik&#x27;s   case   (supra)\n\nwhere non grant of reservation, age relaxation and fee\n\nconcession     in   Joint   CSIR-UGC       NET   Examination    to    TG\n\ncandidates was held to be patently violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_48\">Article 14</a> and\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_49\">21</a> of CoI:\n\n             Likewise in paragraph no.9.3 under heading\n             &#x27;Schemes for Education&#x27;, education grants following\n             norms for grant of scholarships to OBC students\n             was contemplated. Even provision for fee-waiver,\n             free text books, free hostel accommodation and\n             other   facilities at    subsidised   rates     was\n             contemplated.\n\n             While insofar as claim for financial assistance,\n             petitioner seeks to rely on direction issued in\n             Rano&#x27;s case (supra):\n\n       F.    State Government is also directed to provide\n             financial assistance to parents of transgenders and\n             to give scholarship to transgenders upto post-\n             graduate level in order to assimilate them in main\n             stream;\n                                                (emphasis supplied)\n\n\n\n     42.     It is seen first two prayers sought by petitioner\n\nhave been rendered infructuous due to interim order granted\n                                 - 36 -\n\n\n\n\non 22.08.2023 and admission granted by NLSIU. However,\n\nafter securing admission, petitioner claims to have faced\n\ndifficulty for payment of fees and prays for directions for fee\n\nwaiver as decisions relied upon. In view of above, it would be\n\nuseful to refer to case law on TGs.\n\n\nInsofar as reservation for admissions for TGs:\n\n      43.   In case of S. Tharika Banu v. Secretary to Govt.,\n\nreported in 2017 SCC OnLine Mad 10220, petitioner a TG\n\nhad passed +2 examination and applied for Bachelor of Siddha\n\nMedicine    and   Surgery   course.      But,   application   was   not\n\nconsidered either under SC category or under TG category.\n\nTherefore, selection list was challenged. Taking note of fact that\n\nthere was failure to carryout directions issued by Hon&#x27;ble\n\nSupreme Court in NALSA&#x27;s case, High Court of Madras found fit\n\nto issue positive directions as follows:\n\n            &quot;Petitioner&#x27;s claim for admission to the BSMS course\n            cannot be denied on eligibility marks of 50%.\n            Though said fact holds good for only for &quot;males&quot; and\n            &quot;females&quot;. In prospectus, it has not been spoken\n            about transwoman or transgender. Therefore,\n            leniency should be shown to the transgender\n            person, who is longing for an admission into the\n            Siddha College. Therefore, 50% of minimum marks\n            applicable to the male and female students cannot\n            be made applicable to the transgenders. The\n            respondents are guilty of not implementing the\n            order of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court and this Court,\n            by providing a separate reservation for them.\n                                      - 37 -\n\n\n\n\n             Further observed that one seat was already reserved\n             by an interim order passed by this Court on\n             11.10.2017. It is not as if many transgender\n             persons have applied for seats. Only on very rare\n             occasions, this kind of claims would be made and\n             that has to be considered with compassion and\n             benevolence. At the risk of repetition, this Court\n             declares that the petitioner is entitled to a seat in\n             BSMS.&quot;\n\n\n     44.      In S. Tamilselvi&#x27;s case (supra), petitioner, a TG\n\nhad applied for Diploma in Nursing Course for Women as TG\n\ncandidate.         Though,      admission      process      contemplated\n\nreservations       for   Most     Backward      Classes,    no    separate\n\nreservation was provided for TGs. On being unsuccessful,\n\npetitioner filed W.P.no.24750 of 2020, wherein by order dated\n\n18.09.2018 respondents were directed to keep one seat vacant\n\nin Diploma in Nursing Course for Women for academic year\n\n2018-2019 under special category as Transgender. After\n\npassing said course, petitioner applied for Post Basic B.Sc.\n\n(Nursing). However was considered as female candidate instead\n\nof TG candidate. Challenging same petition was filed. As there\n\nwas no provision for reservation in favour of TGs, High Court of\n\nMadras by following NALSA&#x27;s case issued following directions:\n\n             (I)    petitioner as third gender/transgender in a special\n                    category i.e. transgender category for purpose of\n                    admission to course concerned for which the present\n                    merit list has been issued by the 3rd respondent\n                    only for female and male candidates.\n                                      - 38 -\n\n\n\n\n           (II)     petitioner, if any other transgender candidate made\n                    application for the very said course, a separate\n                    category of merit list shall be prepared by the 3rd\n                    respondent consisting of only the transgender\n                    candidates and based on the inter se merit among\n                    the transgender candidates, if more than one\n                    candidate is available i.e. more than the petitioner,\n                    based on the inter se merit admission shall be given\n                    to those transgender candidates.\n\n           (III) The needful as indicated above shall be immediately\n                 undertaken by the respondents especially the 3rd\n                 respondent and accordingly the selection shall go on\n                 including the name of the petitioner under the\n                 special category i.e. transgender category.&quot;\n\n\nDecisions for Reservations for TGs in Employment\n\n     45.      W.P.no.31091 of 2013 disposed of on 05.07.2016\n\n(Swapna v. The Chief Secretary), Division Bench of Madras\n\nHigh Court directed State Government to look into question of\n\npost or percentage based reservation in educational institutions\n\nand public employment for transgender persons in furtherance\n\nof NALSA judgment.\n\n\n     46.      In Mrinal Barik&#x27;s case (supra), petitioner was TG\n\nhad earlier approached Court in WPA 415 of 2023 for seeking\n\nreservation    in     employment,       by    order   dated    19.04.2023,\n\ndirected to provide reservation as per judgment of NALSA was\n\nissued. When petitioner was not called for interview even after\n\npassing eligibility test, petition was filed. High Court of\n\nCalcutta, following directions in NALSA&#x27;s case directed Chief\n                                  - 39 -\n\n\n\n\nSecretary of Government of West Bengal to ensure 1%\n\nreservation for TGs, in all public employments under State by\n\nexercising extraordinary jurisdiction. It also issued positive\n\ndirections     to   Government   to       arrange   for   interview   and\n\ncounseling of petitioner as a special case and to recruit her as\n\nan Assistant Teacher in primary section.\n\n\n      47.      In Rakshika Raj v. State of T.N., reported in\n\n2024 SCC OnLine Mad 1624, High Court of Madras was faced\n\nwith challenge against provision for vertical reservation for TGs,\n\nit was held:\n\n             &quot;Once gender identity was given horizontal\n             reservation, it follows that transgender community,\n             being a socially and educationally backward\n             community discriminated on basis of gender\n             identity, should also be entitled to similar\n             reservation. It had accordingly directed state to\n             provide horizontal reservation to petitioner as\n             separate gender.&quot;\n\n\n\n      48.      In K. Prithika Yashini v. Chairman, Tamil Nadu\n\nUniformed Services Recruitment Board, reported in 2015\n\nSCC OnLine Mad 11830:\n\n             &quot;When, petitioner a male to female TG had\n             participated in selection for post of Sub-Inspector,\n             petitioner&#x27;s candidature was considered under male\n             and was non-selected. Taking note of fact that there\n             were no other TG candidate appointed, High Court\n                      - 40 -\n\n\n\n\nof Madras, directed recruitment of petitioner with\nfollowing observation:\n\n13. There can be various physical changes and\nmental effects arising from the situation in which the\npetitioner finds herself. The respondent failed to\nprovide for the third gender in the application Form\nand thus, the petitioner had to rush to the Court to\nassert her rights. The next stage was to find out as\nto what bench mark should apply to the petitioner\nand thus, benefit was given to the petitioner\naccordingly, in which she was successful. We do not\nthink that in the physical endurance test, a\ndifference of 1.11 seconds should come in the way\nof the petitioner in being considered for recruitment.\nWe hasten to add that she will have to meet the\nbench mark of the recruitment process, but the case\ncannot be knocked out in the middle, as was sought\nto be done by the respondent.\n\n14. There is stated to be no other transgender as a\ncandidate in the selection for recruitment as Sub\nInspector, an aspect conceded by the learned\nAdditional Advocate General. Thus, even if one\nperson is recruited under this category, it would be\nthe petitioner. The counter-affidavit of the\nrespondent shows that there are two other\ntransgenders serving as police constables and the\npetitioner would be really the third one. The social\nimpact of such recruitment cannot be lost sight\nof, which would give strength to the case of\ntransgenders. The petitioner must reach the\nfinishing line and not be stopped and\ndisqualified in the middle.\n\n15. We are sure that by the time the next\nrecruitment process is carried out, the respondent\nwould have taken corrective measures for including\nthe third gender as a category.\n\n16. We are, thus, of the view that the petitioner is\nentitled to be recruited to the post of Sub Inspector\nand for declaration of her result with the hope that\nshe would carry out the duties with dedication and\ncommitment to advance the cause of other\ntransgenders.&quot;\n                                 - 41 -\n\n\n\n\n                                               (emphasis supplied)\n\n\n     49.   Similarly in R. Anushri v. T.N. Public Service\n\nCommission, reported in 2024 SCC OnLine Mad 2211,\n\nwhere a TG candidate had questioned non-inclusion of TG\n\ncategory   in   employment      notification    for   Civil   Services\n\nExamination, following decision in NALSA&#x27;s case, it was held:\n\n           &quot;9. Though the above said National Legal Service\n           Authority case came to be decided by the Hon&#x27;ble\n           Supreme Court as early as 15.04.2014, still neither\n           the State government, nor the Central Government\n           has come forward to formulate a uniform mode of\n           employment opportunities to be provided for the\n           transgenders. In many of the cases, the guidelines\n           issued by the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in the\n           aforesaid paragraphs in NALSA case has been\n           misconstrued. The Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court has\n           directed the Centre and the State Governments to\n           take steps to treat transgender as socially and\n           educationally backward class of the citizens and\n           extend all kinds of reservation in case of admission\n           in    educational   institution   and    for    public\n           appointments. This direction has been misconstrued\n           at many times by the State governments and the\n           agencies of State Governments by placing a\n           transgender under most backward community or to\n           the    caste   whichever     advantageous    to   the\n           transgender. This was not the intention of the\n           Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court while delivering the\n           judgment referred supra. The Hon&#x27;ble Supreme\n           Court has only directed to extend the benefits that\n           are extended to backward class communities to the\n           transgender, at no point of time, the Hon&#x27;ble\n           Supreme Court has directed the State and the\n           Central Government to place the transgender under\n           backward class or most backward class category.\n\n           10. Moreover, the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court has\n           clearly expressed that the transgenders should be\n           treated as unique and the transgenders should not\n                     - 42 -\n\n\n\n\nbe treated one among the male or female. In fact,\nwhen the State of Punjab had placed all the\ntransgenders under male category, the Hon&#x27;ble\nSupreme Court has held such action as illegal and\nunsustainable. This is evident in Paragraph No. 76\nthe aforesaid NALSA Judgment and the same is\nextracted as follows:--\n\n    &quot;76. <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_50\">Article 14</a> has used the expression\n    &quot;person&quot; and the <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_51\">Article 15</a> has used the\n    expression &quot;citizen&quot; and &quot;sex&quot; so also\n    <a href=\"/doc/211089/\" id=\"a_52\">Article 16.</a> <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_53\">Article 19</a> has also used the\n    expression &quot;citizen&quot;. <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_54\">Article 21</a> has used\n    the    expression    &quot;person&quot;.    All  these\n    expressions, which are &quot;gender neutral&quot;\n    evidently refer to human-beings. Hence,\n    they      take    within     their    sweep\n    Hijras/Transgenders and are not as such\n    limited to male or female gender. Gender\n    identity as already indicated forms the core\n    of one&#x27;s personal self, based on self\n    identification, not on surgical or medical\n    procedure. Gender identity, in our view, is\n    an integral part of sex and no citizen can\n    be discriminated on the ground of gender\n    identity, including those who identify as\n    third gender.&quot;\n\nWhen that being so, the question of treating the\ntransgenders either as male, or female is\nunsustainable and even more under any one\ncommunity is also not sustainable.\n\n11. Coming back to the present case, in Notification\ndated 27.04.2017, in the General Information Serial\nNumber 5 (B), the rule of reservation of\nappointment is made applicable separately to each\nposts divisions. 20% of all vacancies in direct\nrecruitment have been given on 10/20 preferential\nbasis to the persons studied in Tamil medium, the\nsame way reservations to ex-servicemen is made\napplicable, as per <a href=\"/doc/191303086/\" id=\"a_55\">Section 27 (C)</a> of Tamil Nadu\nGovernment Servants (Conditions of Service) Act,\n2016, and 10% of vacancies out of 30% of\nvacancies set apart for women applicants in direct\nrecruitment are reserved for destitute widows. Apart\n                      - 43 -\n\n\n\n\nfrom this, 3% of reservation for differently abled\npersons.\n12. It is clear that the entire notification does not\nspecify any reservations or treating the transgender\nas a separate category as directed by the Hon&#x27;ble\nSupreme Courts as well as this Court in very many\ncases. Thus it is very clear that the respondents\nhave not recognised the rights of the transgender,\ndespite there being several judgments directing\nthem to treat the transgender as a separate\ncategory. In fact, it would be appropriate to extract\nthe observation made by the Hon&#x27;ble Division Bench\nof this Court in Writ Appeal No. 330 of 2018 dated\n22.02.2018, wherein at Paragraph Nos. 5 and 6, it is\nheld as follows:--\n\n    &quot;5. Even as we pass the above order, we\n    are inclined to observe as follows:--\n\n    From the submission of Ms. Narmadha\n    Sampath, learned Additional Advocate\n    General-VIII, we gather that it is following\n    observation in paragraph 67 of the\n    judgment of Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court\n    in National         Legal           Services\n    Authority v. Union of India [(2014) 5 SCC\n    438] which has led Government of the\n    State to include transgenders in the list of\n    Most Backward Classes (MBC) in G.O.(Ms).\n    No. 28, Backward Classes, Most Backward\n    Classes and Minorities Welfare (BCC)\n    Department,     dated   06.04.2015.      We\n    reproduce paragraph 67 in the aforesaid\n    judgment:--\n\n    &quot;TGs have been systematically denied the\n    rights under <a href=\"/doc/1952106/\" id=\"a_56\">Article 15(2)</a>, that is, not to be\n    subjected to any disability, liability,\n    restriction or condition in regard to access\n    to public places. TGs have also not been\n    afforded special provisions envisaged\n    under <a href=\"/doc/251667/\" id=\"a_57\">Article 15(4)</a> for the advancement of\n    the socially and educationally backward\n    classes (SEBC) of citizens, which they are,\n    and hence legally entitled and eligible to\n    get the benefits of SEBC. State is bound to\n                      - 44 -\n\n\n\n\n    take some affirmative action for their\n    advancement so that the injustice done to\n    them for centuries could be remedied. TGs\n    are also entitled to enjoy economic, social,\n    cultural and political rights without\n    discrimination,     because        forms      of\n    discrimination on the ground of gender are\n    violative of fundamental freedoms and\n    human rights. TGs have also been denied\n    rights     under     <a href=\"/doc/1011960/\" id=\"a_58\">Article     16(2)</a>      and\n    discriminated    against     in    respect of\n    employment or office under the State on\n    the ground of sex. TGs are also entitled to\n    reservation in the matter of appointment,\n    as     envisaged    under       <a href=\"/doc/68038/\" id=\"a_59\">Article 16(4)</a> of\n    the Constitution. State is bound to take\n    affirmative action to give them due\n    representation in public services.&quot;\n\nSimilarly G.O.(Ms). No. 567, Home (Police VI)\nDepartment, dated 02.08.2016 states that a\ntransgender candidate, who applies as Third Gender,\nshall be eligible for appointment in the vacancies\nreserved for women candidates as well as vacancies\nunder the general category. This is presented as a\nconcession shown to transgenders and has missed\nthe observation in the order of Hon&#x27;ble Supreme\nCourt in National Legal Services Authority v. Union\nof India [(2014) 5 SCC 438] in paragraph 135,\nparticularly 135(3), which reads thus:--\n\n    &quot;13.3. We direct the Centre and the State\n    Governments to take steps to treat them\n    as Socially and Educationally Backward\n    Classes of citizens and extend all kinds of\n    reservation in cases of admission in\n    educational institutions and for public\n    appointments&quot;.\n\n    6. A wholesome reading of the judgment of\n    the Apex Court in National Legal Services\n    Authority v. Union of India [(2014) 5 SCC\n    438] reveals that after the abject neglect\n    and gay abandon of the Third sex over the\n    centuries finally has dawned upon the\n    world community. Through the judgment,\n                      - 45 -\n\n\n\n\n    the Supreme Court has impressed upon\n    the Nation the need to undo the wrong\n    silently suffered by the Third Gender of the\n    human race, which has for far too long\n    been oppressed, suppressed and left\n    depressed. If the judgment of the Hon&#x27;ble\n    Supreme Court is seen in such light and if\n    the intent behind the same is to be carried\n    forward, then we see absolutely no reason\n    why reservations in age permissible to\n    destitute widows and Ex-Servicemen and\n    the like should not be extended also to\n    transgenders. This observation would be\n    applicable in equal measure to each and\n    every concession, relaxation of conditions\n    made in any form of public employment. In\n    other words, the aim of Government\n    should be upliftment of the Third gender in\n    every manner possible. We, strongly would\n    recommend the adoption of such a course\n    and earnestly hope that this State be the\n    forerunner in placing those who have too\n    long been tread upon as the least among\n    us, as the first among equals.&quot;\n\n    Though the State Government has passed\n    several notifications subsequent to the\n    orders passed by the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme\n    Court as well as this Court, but, till date,\n    the State Government is still under the\n    confusion and perpetuating the confusion\n    by placing the transgender either in the\n    female or male category along with the\n    caste they belong.\n\n13. In the present case, the petitioner has been\nplaced in the scheduled caste woman category and\ndenied the permission to upload the certificate for\nverification, as she had scored lesser than the cut-\noff mark prescribed for schedule caste woman. This\napproach of the first respondent denying the\npetitioner to upload her certificate on the basis that\nshe has scored lesser mark than the cut of Mark\nprescribed for schedule caste woman category is\nunsustainable. When the notification issued by the\nfirst respondent has not categorised transgender as\n                      - 46 -\n\n\n\n\na special category, the question of transgender\nbeing categorised under woman category is\nunsustainable and against the order passed by the\nHon&#x27;ble Supreme Court and this Court.\n\n14. When a specific question has been posed by this\nCourt to the learned counsels appearing on the side\nof the 2nd and 3rd respondents as to what steps\nhave been taken by the Government after the\nverdict of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court and\nJudgments render by the Hon&#x27;ble Division Bench of\nthis Court, the learned counsel appearing on the\nside of the 2nd and 3rd respondents stated that\nmost of the directions issued by the Hon&#x27;ble\nSupreme Court and the Hon&#x27;ble Division Bench of\nthis Court has been complied with by passing\nseveral government orders in favour of the\ntransgender, however, regarding the transgender\nbeing treated as a separate category is not yet been\nformulated by any law by the government. At\npresent, the third genders are given age relaxation\nsimilarly applicable to scheduled caste shall apply to\nthe transgender candidates and no special privilege\nis granted to the transgender by treating them as\none under the special category.\n\n15. It is to be noted that if there has to be a special\nreservation, as directed by the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme\nCourt provided to the transgender certainly, the\npetitioner would have found a way to lead a life as\nany other citizen of this country legitimately had the\nrespondents have considered her under special\ncategory. The denial to consider the petitioner under\na special category is against the direction issued by\nthe Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court and there cannot be any\nreason for not doing so. Every denial of opportunity\nto a transgender that too when there are very\nminimal number of transgenders, who are\neducationally qualified, the said denial would pull\nback the transgender to live in abnormal life is what\nwe see in the society. It is for the Government to\nimprove the quality of their living by providing\nsufficient opportunity to the transgender in\neducation and employment avenues. Only this would\ncreate a balance in the society as far as the\ntransgenders are concerned.\n                      - 47 -\n\n\n\n\n16. It is also to be noted that the transgenders are\nplaced in the caste in which they are born and\ntreated in the said category. This is of no use and\ndetrimental to their development, the transgenders\nare to be treated as a special category only\nirrespective of their caste and gender (either\nThirunangaiyar or Thirunambi).\n\n17. Therefore this Court has no hesitation to hold\nthat the petitioner is entitled to get special\nreservation on par with other special category\ncandidates. In view of situation prevailing as far as\ntreating the transgender as a special category, this\nCourt is inclined to issue the following directions to\nthe 2nd and 3rd respondents.:--\n\n    (i) The second respondent is directed to\n    treat the transgenders under special\n    category and not to treat them under\n    female or male category in all education\n    and employment avenues.\n\n    (ii) In every employment and educational\n    avenues, the Government shall prescribe\n    separate norms for transgenders which\n    shall be below the norms prescribed for\n    male and female candidates.\n\n    (iii) Further, the second respondent shall\n    ensure by directing all the recruiting\n    agencies to specify transgender as special\n    category and prescribe separate norms for\n    their cut-off mark, the age relaxation that\n    are extended to other special categories\n    shall also be extended to the transgender\n    irrespective of their caste in future\n    employment and educational avenues. The\n    transgender at no point of time in future\n    shall be clubbed under male or female\n    categories.\n\n18. At this juncture, it is brought to the notice of\nthis Court that the notification, which is impugned in\nthis Writ Petition is of the year 2017-2018 all the\n                                 - 48 -\n\n\n\n\n           vacancies are filled and at present, notification\n           number 3/2022 dated 23/2/2022 has been issued,\n           wherein applications are invited for the post which\n           include in the combined civil service examination,\n           which are for interview and non-interview Post\n           group-II and Group-11 A services under various\n           categories for recruiting the post included in\n           combine civil service examination are underway and\n           the recruiting process is ongoing.\n\n           19. In view of the abovesaid detailed discussions\n           and considering the fact that since the petitioner has\n           scored the eligible cut-off mark under the special\n           category in notification No. 10/2017 dated\n           27/4/2017, the first respondent shall permit the\n           petitioner to upload documents for certificate\n           verification under the notification number 3/2022 in\n           non interview post forthwith, as the counselling for\n           the above said notification, viz., 3/2022 is scheduled\n           on 22.06.2024. It is made clear that for the\n           notification No. 3/2022, if there are more number of\n           transgenders, the petitioner having applied for\n           Notification 2017 should be given first preference\n           along with other transgenders.&quot;\n\n\n     50.   In Shanavi Ponnusamy v. Ministry of Civil\n\nAviation, reported in 2022 SCC OnLine SC 1581, petitioner,\n\na TG applied for selection as Cabin Crew in Air India under\n\nfemale category as no separate category for TGs was provided.\n\nOn non-consideration of candidature, writ petition was filed,\n\nwherein it was held:\n\n           &quot;7. Transgender persons routinely face multiple\n           forms    of    oppression,    social  exclusion   and\n           discrimination, especially in the field of healthcare,\n           employment and education. Gender diverse persons,\n           including transgender persons, continue to face\n           barriers    in    accessing     equal     employment\n           opportunities, especially in the formal sector, due to\n                                      - 49 -\n\n\n\n\n             the operation of gender stereotypes. Gender\n             stereotypes in the workplace disproportionately\n             impact transgender persons for not subscribing to\n             societal norms about appropriate &#x27;feminine&#x27; and\n             &#x27;masculine&#x27; appearances and mannerisms.\n\n             8. Bearing the provisions of the 2019 Act\n             and NALSA judgment (supra) in mind, it is\n             necessary     for  the    Central  Government,      in\n             consultation with the National Council, to devise a\n             policy framework in terms of which reasonable\n             accommodation can be provided for transgender\n             persons in seeking recourse to avenues of\n             employment in establishments covered by the\n             provisions of the 2019 Act. The enactment by\n             Parliament embarks a watershed in the evolution of\n             the rights of transgender persons. The provisions of\n             the 2019 Act need to be implemented in letter and\n             spirit by formulating appropriate policies. The Union\n             Government must take the lead in this behalf and\n             provide clear guidance and enforceable standards to\n             all other entities, including, those of the Union\n             Government,         State      Governments       and\n             establishments governed by the 2019 Act.&quot;\n\n\nMeasures taken by Governments for providing financial\naid to TGs:\n\n       51.    It was reported in Press Media that Government of\n\nMaharashtra has offered free education to TGs upto PG levels, a\n\ndirection accepted even by aided and affiliated Universities1.\n\nSimilarly, Karnataka State Open University, Mysuru2 and\n\nDr.Babasaheb Ambedkar Open University3, (established by\n\n\n\n\n1\n  http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/105774121.cms?utm_source=conte\nntofinterest&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=cppst\n2\n   https://kswdc.karnataka.gov.in/uploads/media_to_upload1655970330.pdf.\n3\n   https://baou.edu.in//\n                                          - 50 -\n\n\n\n\nGovernment of Gujarat) have also announced to provide fee\n\nexempted education to TG in all courses offered by them.\n\n\n          52.    Even     Department         of    Social   Justice    of      Union\n\nGovernment has announced payment of scholarship amount of\n\nRs.13,500/- for eligible TG candidates as post-matric/prematric\n\nscholarship4.\n\n\n\n          53.    Under      E.G.O(Rt)       No     145/2018      (S.J.D)       dated\n\n20.03.2018,           Government       of   Kerala    has     made     budgetary\n\nallocation       of   Rs.35,00,000/-         for   providing     scholarship      to\n\ntransgenders in 4th Std, 7th Std, 10th Std., Higher Secondary,\n\nfor providing shelter homes during educational period, training\n\nfor employment etc5. Even National Human Rights Commission\n\nhas issued several directions to Central Government6 including:\n\n                &quot;Transgender students should not be discriminated\n                against in higher studies, and suitable provision for\n                providing financial assistance to them for pursuing\n                degree/ diploma/ PG courses may be ensured.\n                Provision of scholarship and free education for\n                Transgender students also be formulated&quot;\n\n\n\n\n4\n    https://socialjustice.gov.in/writereaddata/UploadFile/39621727941984.pdf\n5\n    https://sjd.kerala.gov.in/scheme-info.php?scheme_id=NzI\n6\n https://nhrc.nic.in/media/press-release/nhrc-issues-advisory-ensure-welfare-\ntransgender-persons\n                                    - 51 -\n\n\n\n\n      54.      In view of above, what would emerge is that taking\n\nnote of default/lack of steps taken by State/Centre and their\n\nAuthorities to give effect to directions issued by Hon&#x27;ble\n\nSupreme Court in NALSA&#x27;s case (supra) even after lapse of\n\nseveral years, directions as brought out above are liberally\n\nissued to favour assimilation of TGs into mainstream of society\n\nby   providing       reservation   in   admissions       into   educational\n\ninstitutions as well as in employment as measures of ensuring\n\ngender equality.\n\n\n      55.      In instant case, petitioner is seeking admission in\n\nNLSIU on ground that admission process did not provide\n\nreservation for TGs. Though, by interim order, direction was\n\nissued to admit petitioner and same was complied albeit after\n\nunsuccessfully challenging interim order, petitioner now pleads\n\nthat without financial assistance reservation for TGs itself would\n\nbe   futile.    It    is   contended        that   TGs   normally    suffer\n\nhomelessness, disownment by family, unemployment and/or\n\ndiscrimination in employment resulting in lack of representation\n\nin education, employment as well as in public life. These\n\ndisabilities have received recognition in NALSA&#x27;s case (supra)\n                                 - 52 -\n\n\n\n\nresulting in issuance of necessary directions and measures for\n\naddressing same.\n\n\n      56.   It is seen petitioner has paid sum of Rs.50,000/-\n\ntowards part of academic fee on admission to 3 years LL.B\n\nCourse. But, fees prescribed by NLSIU for 1st year of said\n\nCourse is Rs.3,75,500/-, which petitioner claims to be unable to\n\npay due to factors affecting TGs. Though, it was contended by\n\npetitioner that fee structure or terms of financial aid policy were\n\nnot disclosed or available in public domain when petitioner had\n\nsought admission, it is not in dispute that petitioner has sought\n\nfinancial assistance from NLSIU. In response, NLSIU has stated\n\nthat it offered financial assistance to extent and as per existing\n\nfinancial aid policy. Thus, NLSIU has not denied need for\n\nfinancial assistance by petitioner. On other hand, it has stated,\n\nif existing financial aid policy does not suit petitioner&#x27;s needs, it\n\ncannot be helped.\n\n\n      57.   It is however seen NLSIU taking pride in various\n\nmeasures for transgender persons to create level playing field\n\n&#x27;to respond to all forms of discrimination and provide inclusive\n\nand supportive educational environment&#x27;, in NLSIU, taking note\n\nof NALSA&#x27;s case (supra). Strangely, it has not disclosed\n                                - 53 -\n\n\n\n\nwhether any steps are in progress or were taken for providing\n\nreservation and suitable financial aid policy specifically tailored\n\nfor TGs. It is also not known whether existing admission\n\nprocess accommodates TGs securing admission or undergoing\n\nstudies in NLSIU.\n\n\n      58.   Therefore, failure of constitutional guarantees of\n\nequality of opportunity due to lack of measures/adequate\n\nmeasures for positive discrimination in securing sufficient\n\nrepresentation to TGs in educational avenues in NLSIU is\n\nevident. This Court in Sangama and Anr. v. State of\n\nKarnataka and Ors. (W.P.no.8511/2020 disposed of on\n\n02.03.2022), had left it to State Government to provide\n\nreservation for TGs in education. Learned AGA has placed on\n\nrecord proposals stated to be under consideration before State\n\nCabinet.\n\n\n\n      59.   Hence, consideration herein is confined to need for\n\nissuing directions to NLSIU for providing reservation and\n\nfinancial assistance to TGs for admission to III year LL.B.\n\nCourse in NLSIU, keeping in mind that petitioner&#x27;s admission in\n\nNLSIU for III year LLB Course during academic year 2023-2024\n                                  - 54 -\n\n\n\n\nis spent due to non-payment of fees. But, as petitioner\n\ncontinues to aspire pursuit of said Course and is not shown to\n\nbe   barred,   cause   of   action    survives.   Therefore,   having\n\nconcluded that present admission and financial aid policy of\n\nNLSIU is discriminatory against TGs and thereby deprived them\n\nof pursuing LL.B. Courses in NLSIU, objections of NLSIU being\n\ntechnical   require    to   be   ignored/waived,     in   facts   and\n\ncircumstances of present case.\n\n\n\n      60.   In Mx.Sumana Pramanik&#x27;s case (supra), failure to\n\nprovide reservation and fee concession to TGs noted for issuing\n\ndirections to provide same by treating TGs as separate\n\ncategories along with other reserved categories. In Rakshika\n\nRaj and A. Nivetha&#x27;s cases (supra), need for issuing directions\n\nfor providing horizontal reservation for TGs after noticing failure\n\nto implement directions issued in NALSAs case was examined.\n\nLikewise, in Rano&#x27;s case (supra) directions were issued to\n\nState taking note of Scheme for &#x27;Promotion of Transgender\n\nEquality &amp; Justice&#x27;, evolved by State. In K. Prithika Yashini&#x27;s\n\ncase (supra) representation even by single TG candidate\n\nthough symbolic would go a long way in providing inclusive and\n\nsupportive environment [highlighted in K. Prithika Yashini&#x27;s\n                                 - 55 -\n\n\n\n\ncase (supra)]. Under such circumstances, positive directions\n\nwere issued for admission of petitioner - TG candidate by\n\nholding that academic eligibility prescribed for male and female\n\ncandidates cannot be applied to TGs, until sufficient number of\n\nTG candidates available in S. Tharika Banu&#x27;s case (supra);\n\ndirection for preparation of separate merit list for TGs and to\n\nadmit petitioner unless any other TG candidate with higher\n\nmerit than petitioner were available in S. Tamilselvi&#x27;s case\n\n(supra) and general direction issued to Government to look into\n\nquestion of post or percentage based reservation in educational\n\ninstitutions and public employment for transgender persons in\n\nfurtherance of NALSA judgment in Swapna&#x27;s cases (supra).\n\n\n     61.     Though     determining      specific    percentage     of\n\nreservation for TGs in educational avenues and manner of\n\nproviding financial assistance would be beyond scope of petition\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_60\">Art.226</a> of Constitution of India and same may also\n\nrequire    appointing   a   Commission,     this    Court   deems   it\n\nappropriate to prescribe interim measures, until NLSIU itself\n\nformulates reservation and financial aid for TGs in admission to\n\nCourses offered by it including considering complete fee waiver\n                                   - 56 -\n\n\n\n\nto promote/secure sufficient number of TG candidates to fill\n\nseats reserved for TGs. Hence, following:\n\n                                  ORDER\n</pre>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_1\">      i.

Until then to provide reservation of 0.5%\n            (half the percentage of reservation provided\n            for TGs in employment under State) as\n            interim reservation with fee waiver and for\n            which NLSIU may apply to State/Central\n            Government for appropriate grant.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_4\">     iv.    To admit petitioner under interim reservation\n            for TGs, if there is no other TG candidate\n            who seeks or is admitted to III year LL.B.\n            Course for current academic year.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_5\">      v.    In view of fact that interim reservation is\n            necessitated due to failure to carry out\n            directions issued by Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court\n            in NALSA&#x27;s case, admission of TG candidates\n            to   III   year    LL.B.

It would also be appropriate to direct State\n              to take note of claims for reservation for TGs\n              in education also and formulate reservation\n              and fee reimbursement policy as contained\n              in para-135.3 in NALSA&#x27;s case (supra).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_9\">        Appreciation for assistance rendered by Mr. S.R.Naveen\n\nKumar - Research Assistant, is placed on record.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_10\">                                          Sd/-\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_11\">                                   (RAVI V HOSMANI)\n                                         JUDGE\n\nGrd/-\n</p> ","numcites":25,"numcitedby":0,"docsource":"Karnataka High Court","citetid":6082877,"divtype":"judgments","courtcopy":true,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
