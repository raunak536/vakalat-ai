The petitioner herein sought for copies of all memos, show\n         cause notices and censure/punishment awarded to the third\n         respondent from his employer and also details viz. movable and\n         immovable properties and also the details of his investments,\n         lending and borrowing from Banks and other financial institutions.\n         Further, he has also sought for the details of gifts stated to have\n         accepted by the third respondent, his family members and friends\n         and relatives at the marriage of his son. The information mostly\n         sought for finds a place in the income tax returns of the third\n         respondent.

However, the present matter wherein the appellant has sought the details of\nthe Income Tax Returns filed by her husband, Mr. Amit Arvindbhai Chauhan can\nbe distinguished from the aforesaid decision dated 15-05-2018 of the Division\nBench of the Hon&#x27;ble High Court of Madhya Pradesh on the premise that in that\nmatter the information was sought regarding an employee&#x27;s salary from the\nemployer being a government department i.e. the BSNL which otherwise was\nobliged to disclose the remuneration of its employee in view of <a href=\"/doc/1493389/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 4(1)(b)(x)</a>\nof the RTI Act, 2005 and no direction was given by the Hon&#x27;ble High Court of\nMadhya Pradesh to disclose the Income Tax Returns of the employee. Moreover,\nthe decision of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court of India in <a href=\"/doc/160205361/\" id=\"a_25\">Girish Ramachandra\nDeshpande</a> (supra) was only distinguished with regard to the limited point that\nwife was entitled to know the remuneration details of her husband. No other\nopinion/decision was conveyed regarding other personal information. Therefore,\nthis Commission does not agree with the contentions put forth by the appellant in\nthe 2nd appeal with regard to the applicability of the aforesaid decision dated 15-\n05-2018 for seeking the details of the income tax returns filed by her husband, Mr.\nAmit Arvindbhai Chauhan.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\">9.

State of Madhya\n     Pradesh</a> (1975) 2 SCC 148, Rajagopal Vs. State of Tamil Nadu\n     (<a href=\"/doc/1068532/\" id=\"a_36\">1994) 6 SCC 632 and Collector Vs. Canara Bank</a> (2005) 1 SCC 496\n     has held right to privacy to be a sacrosanct facet of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_37\">Article 21</a> of the\n     Constitution of India. It was further held that when any personal\n     information sought has no nexus with any public activity or interest,\n     the same is not to be provided. Finding the information sought <a href=\"/doc/1068532/\" id=\"a_38\">in that\n     case</a> to be even remotely having no relationship with any public\n     activity or interest and rather being a direct invasion in private life of\n     another, information was denied.</span></span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"155236387\" id=\"span_23\">The full bench of this Court also in\n     Secretary General, Supreme Court of <a href=\"/doc/155236387/\" id=\"a_39\">India Vs. Subhash Chandra\n     Agarwal</a> AIR 2010 Del. 159 has held that the conflict between the\n     right to personal privacy and public interest in the disclosure of\n     personal information is recognized by the legislature by\n     incorporating <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the Act. It was further observed that\n     personal information including tax returns, medical records etc.\n     cannot be disclosed unless the bar against disclosure is lifted by\n     establishing sufficient public interest in disclosure and disclosure\n     even then can be made only after duly notifying the third party and\n     after considering his views.&quot;</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_23\">13. At this juncture, this Commission deems it appropriate to quote <a href=\"/doc/436180/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 2(n)</a>\nof the RTI Act, 2005 which reads as under:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">    &quot;2(n):- &quot;third party&quot; means a person other than the citizen making a\n    request for information and includes a public authority.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_24\">14. From the words circumscribed u/<a href=\"/doc/436180/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 2(n)</a> of the RTI Act, 2005, it is\nvividly clear that any person other than the citizen making a request for\ninformation can be termed as &#x27;third party&#x27;. Therefore, Mr. Amit Arvindbhai\nChauhan being a person other than the RTI applicant surely comes within the\ndefinition of &#x27;third party&#x27;. Moreover, the CPIO has also not intended to disclose the\ninformation treating it as confidential and has rather pleaded that there is no public\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                                                                           Page 7 of 10</span>\n interest in the matter. This Commission also does not find any public interest\nwhich outweighs the harm caused in its disclosure.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"155236387\" id=\"span_25\">15. This Commission also refers to the judgment of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme\nCourt of India in Civil Appeal No. 10044 of 2010 &amp; Ors. dated 13-11-2019 titled\nas CPIO, Supreme Court of <a href=\"/doc/155236387/\" id=\"a_43\">India v. Subhash Chandra Agarwal</a>, wherein, it\nwas observed as follows:-</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">         &quot;59. Reading of the aforesaid judicial precedents, in our opinion,\n         would indicate that personal records, including name, address,\n         physical, mental and psychological status, marks obtained, grades\n         and answer sheets, are all treated as personal information.\n         Similarly, professional records, including qualification,\n         performance, evaluation reports, ACRs, disciplinary proceedings,\n         etc. are all personal information. Medical records, treatment,\n         choice of medicine, list of hospitals and doctors visited, findings\n         recorded, including that of the family members, information\n         relating to assets, liabilities, income tax returns, details of\n         investments, lending and borrowing, etc. are personal information.\n         Such personal information is entitled to protection from\n         unwarranted invasion of privacy and conditional access is\n         available when stipulation of larger public interest is satisfied.\n         This list is indicative and not exhaustive.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_26\">16. In light of the aforesaid decisions and the legal principles enunciated therein,\nthis Commission after considering the factual matrix of the case is of the opinion\nthat in the absence of any larger public interest in the matter, the appellant is not\nentitled to seek the Income Tax Returns filed by the third party, Mr. Amit\nArvindbhai Chauhan which is exempted u/<a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the RTI Act, 2005.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_27\">17. It is to be noted that the appellant has not sought the &#x27;gross income&#x27; of her\nhusband in the RTI application. Nonetheless, during the hearing, she requested this\nCommission for disclosure of at least the &#x27;gross income&#x27; of Mr. Amit Arvindbhai\nChauhan so that she could defend her maintenance case. Therefore, considering the\naspect of marital discord between the husband and wife vis-à-vis her right of\nmaintenance, this Commission is of the opinion that the respondent should\nconsider providing only the limited information i.e. the numerical figure(s) of the\n&#x27;gross income&#x27; of her husband, Mr. Amit Arvindbhai Chauhan, within a period of\n15 working days from the date of receipt of this order after the period of lockdown\nis over.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_28\">18.
