The said\n\nGovernment orders are issued in pursuance of a policy of the\n\nGovernment to provide house plots to landless poor. The policy of the\n\nGovernment could be set aside only on limited grounds where\n\nfundamental rights are violated. In the present case, it is not the\n\ncase of the writ petitioners that their fundamental rights are violated,\n\nthe petitioners are canvassing that the plots are being allotted in the\n\nname of women and it amounts to discrimination on the ground of\n\nsex, the said contention is misconceived as <a href=\"/doc/1942013/\" id=\"a_22\">Article 15(1)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1659104/\" id=\"a_23\">(3)</a> have\n\nto be read harmoniously, but not in isolation.

In <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_25\">Article 15</a>, the framers of the Constitution\n\nin their wisdom had carved out an exception that may be termed as\n\nprotective discrimination i.e., the State shall make special provisions\n\nfor advancement of women or children and empower socially and\n\neconomically backward classes. The state in its august object for the\n\nadvancement of women had formulated policy under G.O.Ms.No.367\n\nRevenue (Assignment -I) Department dated 19.08.2019 to allot land\n\nin the name of women in a family. A family is taken as a unit for\n                                                                      MSM,J\n                                                              wp_25275_2020\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                                    18</span>\n\n\n\nallotment of land, family consists of both spouses and children. Mere\n\nallotting land on the name of women does not amount to\n\ndiscrimination as the said benefit is derived to entire family as all\n\nfamily members live in the house that would be constructed in the\n\nsaid land. The Government policy for framing guidelines is,\n\nexclusively, domain of the Government of the day, the views of a\n\nparticular individual cannot be substituted in place of policy of the\n\nGovernment. If that analogy is adopted there would be no end for\n\nplacates of litigation. The petitioners failed to demonstrate the policy\n\nso framed is offending fundamental rights of the petitioners.

It appears\n\nthat the petitioners are suffering from Jaundice in understanding the\n\npolicy of the Government in the breath.

After   giving   our   careful    consideration   to   the   facts   and\n      circumstances of the case and to the submissions made by the learned\n      counsel for the parties, it appears to us that the Industrial Policy of 1979\n      which was subsequently revised from time to time cannot be held to be\n      arbitrary and based on no reason whatsoever but founded on mere ipse dixit\n      of the State Government of M.P.

This Court, in no uncertain terms, has\n      sounded a note of caution by indicating that policy decision is in the domain\n      of the executive authority of the State and the court should not embark on\n      the unchartered ocean of public policy and should not question the efficacy\n      or otherwise of such policy so long the same does not offend any provision of\n      the stature or the Constitution of India. The supremacy of each of the three\n      organs of the State i.e. legislature, executive and judiciary in their respective\n      fields of operation needs to be emphasised. The power of judicial review of\n      the executive and legislative action must be kept within the bounds of\n      constitutional scheme so that there may not be any occasion to entrance\n      misgivings about the role of judiciary in outstepping its limit by unwarranted\n      judicial activism being very often talked of in these days.

Now we revert to the last submission, whether the new State policy\n       is justified in not reimbursing an employee, his full medical expenses\n       incurred on such treatment, if incurred in any hospital in India not being\n       a government hospital in Punjab. Question is whether the new policy\n       which is restricted by the financial constraints of the State to the rates in\n       Aiims would be in violation of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_86\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India. So\n       far as questioning the validity of governmental policy is concerned in our\n       view it is not normally within the domain of any court, to weight the pros\n       and cons of the policy or to scrutinise it and test the degree of its\n       beneficial or equitable disposition for the purpose of varying, modifying or\n       annulling it, based on howsoever sound and good reasoning, except\n       whether it is arbitrary or violative of any constitutional, statutory or any\n       other provision of law. When Government forms its policy, it is based on a\n       number of circumstances on facts, law including constraints based on its\n       resources. It is also based on expert opinion. It would be dangerous if\n       court is asked to test the utility, beneficial effect of the policy or its\n       appraisal based on facts set out on affidavits. The court would dissuade\n       itself from entering into this realm which belongs to the executive.

Hence, it is appropriate to advert to\n\nB.S.O.21, which is a guideline for the revenue officials for disposal\n\nof the Government land.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_122\">     B.S.O.21 deals with ―assignment of House-site in villages and\n\ntowns‖. This standing order applies to the disposal of house sites\n\nfor private purposes only whether to individuals, firms or societies\n\nand whether the grant is free or is made on payment of the full or a\n\nconcessional value for the land. Assignments for industrial,\n\ncommercial or co-operative purposes will be in addition to the\n\nusual conditions of assignment be subject to conditions on the\n\nlines of these prescribed in paragraph 6 of the standing order\n\nNo.24 mutatis mutandis, the conditions in sub-paragraph (2) of the\n\nparagraph being followed in cases in which the full market value of\n\nthe land is paid by the assignee and those in sub-paragraph (i) in\n\nother cases. The disposal of buildings sites for public purposes is\n\ngoverned by Standing Order No.24. <a href=\"/doc/64735852/\" id=\"a_102\">Section 1</a> deals with allotment\n\nof site in villages.

As per clause 2(x) of <a href=\"/doc/64735852/\" id=\"a_104\">section 1</a>, plotted sketches of\n\nthe sites to be granted should invariably be prepared. Also\n\nmeasurements should be taken connecting the sites with any\n                                                                    MSM,J\n                                                            wp_25275_2020\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_93\">                                 44</span>\n\n\n\npermanent or semi-permanent marks in the neighbourhood or\n\nunion survey stones where they exist with a view to the sites being\n\nlocated in the event of disputes.

Clause (xiii) of <a href=\"/doc/64735852/\" id=\"a_105\">Section 1</a> deals with extent of\n\nhouse site allotted.

(extracted in the earlier part of order)\n\n      In view of <a href=\"/doc/555882/\" id=\"a_116\">Article 39</a> of the Constitution of India the State can\n\ndistribute material resources to subserve the common good. Here,\n\nthe scheme ―Navaratnalu - Pedalandariki Illu‖ is taken up as a\n\npolicy decision by the Government. At the same time, the policy must\n\nbe fair and reasonable. Here, in this case, granting permission to sell\n\nproperty after five years of construction of house will have serious\n\nconsequence in future, though they are debarred from claiming\n\nallotment in future. The avowed object of scheme is to provide shelter\n\nto the houseless poor permanently. If the beneficiary has a right to\n\nsell the property after five (5) years, again such beneficiary will\n\nbecome houseless poor and sometimes they may misuse the\n\nsituation prevailing in the State and obtain allotment in different\n\nways. When the State intends to provide permanent shelter to the\n\nhouseless poor, incorporating such condition allowing them to\n\nalienate the property after five (5) years is against the object of\n\nscheme. On account of permission granted to the allottees to sell the\n\nproperty, the very object of the scheme is being defeated. On the\n\nallotment of house site, the houseless became owners of house sites\n\nand on construction, owner of house; after sale, it is nothing but\n\nrestoring status quo ante i.e. he will be a houseless poor again\n\nconsequent upon the sale. Distribution of material resources of the\n                                                                        MSM,J\n                                                                wp_25275_2020\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_99\">                                        49</span>\n\n\n\ncommunity is not for making money by the houseless poor, taking\n\nadvantage of the policy decision of the Government. Therefore, the\n\nadditional ground Nos.(x) (xi) and (xii) issued in G.O.Ms.No.488 dated\n\n02.12.2019 is contrary to the object of the scheme and <a href=\"/doc/555882/\" id=\"a_117\">Article 39</a> of\n\nthe Constitution of India. Therefore, additional guidelines (x) (xi) and\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_133\">(xii) not only defeat the very purpose of allotment of house sites to\n\nthe landless poor, but also violates <a href=\"/doc/555882/\" id=\"a_118\">Article 39</a> of the Constitution of\n\nIndia, besides B.S.O.21. Hence, additional guideline Nos. (x) (xi) and\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_134\">(xii) issued in G.O.Ms.No.488 are illegal, arbitrary and not in the\n\ninterest of houseless poor. On the other hand, the same is defeating\n\nthe very object of allotment of house sites to the houseless poor and\n\nin violation of <a href=\"/doc/555882/\" id=\"a_119\">Article 39</a> of the Constitution of India. Hence, the\n\nadditional   guidelines    (x)   (xi)   and   (xii)   G.O.Ms.No.488   dated\n\n02.12.2019 are hereby declared as illegal, arbitrary and violative of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/555882/\" id=\"a_120\">Article 39</a> of the Constitution of India, contrary to the object of\n\nallotment of house site.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_135\">      As discussed above, clauses in three G.Os (referred supra) are\n\ninconsistent to one another and they are vague, impracticable for\n\nimplementation and enforcement. Therefore, while upholding clause\n\n(3) of G.O.Ms.No.367 dated 19.08.2019, clause (x) (xi) and (xii) of\n\nG.O.Ms.No.488 dated 02.12.2019 and clause (b) and clause (d) of\n\nG.O.Ms.No.99 dated 31.03.2020 are declared as illegal, arbitrary and\n\ninconsistent with one another.

It does not permit such discrimination unless a\n        special provision is made for the purpose. Since it is the special provision\n        which enables the State to do what would otherwise have been\n        unconstitutional, the special provision must be distinct from the action\n        and the making thereof must precede the action sought to be justified\n        thereunder. The use of the word &#x27;provision&#x27; also indicates that the special\n        provision must be made before a legal discrimination in favour of women\n        or children can be made.

It is not possible to read the word &#x27;provision&#x27; as including a\n   decision given in a particular case or matter as it can lead to arbitrary\n   and anomalous results. If that could be done, then an officer, before\n   whom three cases are pending, may give preference to women in one, to a\n   member of the scheduled caste or tribe in another and to the most\n   deserving person only in the remaining case; or he may give preference to\n   women in all the cases or to members of the scheduled castes and tribes\n   in all the cases or may decide all the cases on merits.

It aims at granting special privileges\n\nto the socially backward and underprivileged section of the society,\n\nmost commonly the scheduled castes, scheduled tribes, other\n\nbackward classes, and women. These are the sections of people who\n\noften face racial or caste-based discrimination through centuries by\n\nthe privileged classes on account of their differences based on sex,\n\nreligion, place of birth, race, and most prominently based on the\n\ninstitution called the caste system. Efforts had been made by the\n\nfounding fathers of the Constitution to address the malady through\n\naffirmative action. These actions are justifiably enshrined in the\n\nConstitution of India as ―Protective Discrimination‖. In India, the\n\nConstitution through its various provisions guarantees the rights of\n\nthe downtrodden and underprivileged by way of reservations or\n\nquota in educational institutions, employment, and parliamentary\n\nprivileges as well as command the legislatures to legislate special\n                                                                            MSM,J\n                                                                    wp_25275_2020\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_134\">                                           61</span>\n\n\n\nprovisions        for   their   overall   advancement.   <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_201\">Article   14</a>   of   the\n\nConstitution does not speak of mere formal equality but embodies\n\nreal and substantive equality.

The\n\nright to equality under part III of the Constitution therefore is not\n\nabsolute and is subject to reasonable exceptions. Equality does not\n\nessentially mean that all laws should be universal and general in\n\napplication neither all laws can be applicable in all circumstances.\n\nExplaining the concept of equality, the Supreme Court in &quot;<a href=\"/doc/532154/\" id=\"a_202\">Marri\n\nChandra Sekhar Rao v. Dean, Seth G.S Medical College37</a>&quot;,\n\nobserved that, equality must be a living reality for the people. Those\n\nwho are unequal in status and opportunity cannot be treated by\n\nidentical standards. <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_203\">Article 14</a> permits reasonable classification\n\nbetween potential underprivileged and privileged sections of citizens\n\nbased on definite schemes but strikes out class legislation.\n\nReasonable classification explains that classification or segregation\n\nmust not be artificial, evasive, and arbitrary. Such classifications\n\nmust be based on the rule of intelligible differentia which\n\ndifferentiates between different classes or group of persons from\n\nthose left out of the group. Most importantly, there must be rational\n\nnexus between the differentia and the object sought to be achieved.</span>\n\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"191522\" id=\"span_136\">(Vide:<a href=\"/doc/191522/\" id=\"a_204\">K.Thimmappa v.

Therefore, clause (2) of G.O.Ms.No.367 dated\n\n19.08.2019 is arbitrary and violation of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_315\">Article 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1942013/\" id=\"a_316\">15 (1)</a> of the\n\nConstitution of India.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_177\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1066844\" id=\"span_186\">Taking into consideration the hypothetical situation where a\n\nbachelor, widower with children living below poverty line, they are\n\nnot entitled to claim the benefit of scheme ―Navaratnalu -\n\nPedalandariki Illu‖. Does it amount to distribution of resources\n\nbased on equality is a question to be decided. If the principle <a href=\"/doc/1281050/\" id=\"a_317\">laid\n\ndown by</a> the Apex Court in <a href=\"/doc/1066844/\" id=\"a_318\">―Akhil Bhartiya Upbhokta Congress v.\n\nState of Madhya Pradesh‖</a> (referred supra), certainly it amounts to\n\ndiscrimination of eligible men from women and they will remain as\n\nhouseless poor forever on account of denial of house site allotment\n\nunder the scheme ―Navaratnalu - Pedalandariki Illu‖. Similarly, if\n\na woman obtains divorce after allotment of house site, husband and\n\nchildren would remain houseless poor. These hypothetical situations\n\nwere not visualised and taken into consideration by the State while\n\ntaking such policy decision. Thus, it directly amounts to depriving\n\neligible men to claim the benefit under the said scheme, which is\n\nviolative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_319\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India and contrary to the\n\nobligation that vested on the State to distribute material resources\n\namong the citizens equally as prescribed under <a href=\"/doc/555882/\" id=\"a_320\">Article 39</a> of the\n\nConstitution of India.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_178\">                                                                                 MSM,J\n                                                                         wp_25275_2020\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_187\">                                        74</span>\n\n\n\n      In case of transsexuals, most of them are living below the\n\npoverty line and living by begging, without any shelter for their\n\nprotection. They are facing lot of humiliation for the treatment\n\nextended to them. Though, it is the obligation of the State to take\n\nnecessary steps to treat transsexual on par with men and women,\n\nthe State did not take any positive action so far. Denial of allotment\n\nof house sites to transsexuals is violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_321\">Article 14</a> of the\n\nConstitution of India since <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_322\">Article 15</a> speaks about men and women,\n\nbut not about transsexuals, for the reason that the Constitution\n\nframers did not visualise such situation by the time of preparing\n\nConstitution of India.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_179\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"195593310\" id=\"span_188\">In <a href=\"/doc/195593310/\" id=\"a_323\">―National Legal Services Authority v. Union of India‖</a>\n\n(referred supra) the Apex Court highlighted the duty of the State to\n\nprotect the transsexuals and held as follows:</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_89\">      ―In this country, Transgender community comprise of Hijras, enunch,\n   Kothis, Aravanis, Jogappas, Shiv-Shakthis etc. In Indian community\n   transgender are referred as Hizra or the third gendered people. There\n   exists   wide   range   of   transgender-related   identities,   cultures,   or\n   experience-including Hijras, Aravanis, Kothis, jogtas/Jogappas, and Shiv-\n   Shakthis\n      Though there may not be any statutory regime recognizing &#x27;third\n   gender&#x27; for these TGs. However, we find enough justification to recognize\n   this right of theirs in natural law sphere. Further, such a justification can\n   be traced to the various provisions contained in Part III of the\n   Constitution relating to &#x27;Fundamental Rights&#x27;. In addition to the powerful\n   justification accomplished in the accompanying opinion of my esteemed\n   Brother, additional raison d&#x27;etre for this conclusion is stated hereinafter.\n      We are in the age of democracy, that too substantive and liberal\n   democracy. Such a democracy is not based solely on the rule of people\n   through their representatives&#x27; namely formal democracy. It also has other\n   percepts like Rule of Law, human rights, independence of judiciary,\n   separation of powers etc.\n      There is a recognition to the hard realty that without protection for\n   human rights there can be no democracy and no justification for\n   democracy. In this scenario, while working within the realm of separation\n   of powers (which is also fundamental to the substantive democracy), the\n                                                                                 MSM,J\n                                                                         wp_25275_2020\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_189\">                                         75</span>\n\n\n\n    judicial role is not only to decide the dispute before the Court, but to\n    uphold the rule of law and ensure access to justice to the marginalized\n    section of the society. It cannot be denied that TGs belong to the\n    unprivileged class which is a marginalized section.\n       The role of the Court is to understand the central purpose and theme\n    of the Constitution for the welfare of the society. Our Constitution, like\n    the law of the society, is a living organism. It is based on a factual and\n    social realty that is constantly changing. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"195593310\" id=\"span_190\">Sometimes a change in the law\n    precedes societal change and is even intended to stimulate it. Sometimes,\n    a change in the law is the result in the social realty. When we discuss\n    about the rights of TGs in the constitutional context, we find that in order\n    to bring about complete paradigm shift, law has to play more pre-\n    dominant role. As TGs in India, are neither male nor female, treating\n    them as belonging to either of the aforesaid categories, is the denial of\n    these constitutional rights. It is the denial of social justice which in turn\n    has the effect of denying political and economic justice.‖\n\n\n       Further, the Apex Court in <a href=\"/doc/195593310/\" id=\"a_324\">the said judgment</a> held that ―Centre\n\nand State Governments should also take steps for framing various\n\nsocial welfare schemes for the betterment of Transgenders. Centre\n\nand State Governments should take steps to create public awareness\n\nso that Transgenders will feel that they are also part and parcel of\n\nthe social life and be not treated as untouchables. Centre and the\n\nState Governments should also take measures to regain their respect\n\nand place in the society which once they enjoyed in our cultural and\n\nsocial life.‖\n\n       Consciously, the State did not make any provision to provide\n\nshelter to transsexuals though they are citizens of India, entitled to\n\nclaim equal protection and protection of laws under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_325\">Article 14</a> of the\n\nConstitution of India. Failure to allot house site to transsexuals\n\nignoring them totally would amount to depriving their right of\n\nequality guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_326\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India. If,\n\nhouse sites are not being allotted to them, they will remain homeless\n\nthroughout their life as there is no possibility for them to acquire\n\nsuch property with the meagre amount or means they are getting.</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_90\">                                                                       MSM,J\n                                                               wp_25275_2020\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_191\">                                    76</span>\n\n\n\nOn this ground also, allotment of house site only to women is\n\nviolative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_327\">Article 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1942013/\" id=\"a_328\">15 (1)</a> of the Constitution of India.\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_91\">      Learned counsel for the petitioners also contended that\n\ndiscriminating men, transsexuals from women is violative of\n\ninternational covenants on Human Rights. <a href=\"/doc/735354/\" id=\"a_329\">Article 7</a> of the Universal\n\nDeclaration of Human Rights deals with equality before law. <a href=\"/doc/1987997/\" id=\"a_330\">Article\n\n17</a> of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights deals with right to\n\nown property.

If no such amenities are provided, the\n\nclusters will turn into urban and rural slums.      The World Health\n\nOrganisation (WHO) keeping in view the impact on the health on\n\naccount of inadequate housing issued certain guidelines in 2018\n\nwith reference to housing and health highlighting key health risks.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_217\">      The WHO Housing and health guidelines (HHGL) provide\n\nevidence-based recommendations for healthy housing conditions and\n\ninterventions. Healthy housing is shelter that supports a state of\n                                                                                 MSM,J\n                                                                         wp_25275_2020\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_283\">                                         102</span>\n\n\n\ncomplete physical, mental and social well-being. Healthy housing\n\nprovides a feeling of home, including a sense of belonging, security\n\nand privacy. Healthy housing also refers to the physical structure of\n\nthe dwelling, and the extent to which it enables physical health,\n\nincluding by being structurally sound, by providing shelter from the\n\nelements and from excess moisture, and by facilitating comfortable\n\ntemperatures, adequate sanitation and illumination, sufficient space,\n\nsafe fuel or connection to electricity, and protection from pollutants,\n\ninjury hazards, mould and pests. Whether housing is healthy also\n\ndepends    on     factors    outside     its   walls.    It    depends      on   the\n\nlocal community, which enables social interactions that support\n\nhealth    and     well-being.   Finally,       healthy        housing   relies    on\n\nthe immediate housing environment, and the extent to which this\n\nprovides access to services, green space, and active and public\n\ntransport options, as well as protection from waste, pollution and the\n\neffects of disaster, whether natural or man-made.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_218\">        Exposures and health risks in the home environment are\n\ncritically important because of the large amount of time people spend\n\nthere. In high-income countries, around 70% of people&#x27;s time is\n\nspent    inside   their     home.   In     some    places,      including     where\n\nunemployment levels are higher, and where more people are\n\nemployed in home-based industries, this percentage is even higher.\n\nChildren, the elderly, and those with a disability or chronic illness\n\nare likely to spend most of their time at home, and are therefore\n\nmore exposed to health risks associated with housing. Children are\n\nalso at increased risk of the harms from some of the toxins that are\n\npresent in some housing, such as those in lead paint.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_219\">                                                                                 MSM,J\n                                                                         wp_25275_2020\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_284\">                                        103</span>\n\n\n\n      Housing will become increasingly important to health due to\n\ndemographic and climate changes. The number of people aged over\n\n60 years of age, who spend a larger proportion of their time at home,\n\nwill double by 2050. The changing weather patterns associated with\n\nclimate change also underline the importance of housing providing\n\nprotection from cold, heat and extreme weather events.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_220\">      Poor housing can expose people to several health risks. For\n\nexample, structurally deficient housing, due to poor construction or\n\nmaintenance, can increase the likelihood that people slip or fall,\n\nincreasing the risk of injury. Poor accessibility to homes may expose\n\ntheir disabled and elderly residents to the risk of injury, stress and\n\nisolation. Housing that is insecure, sometimes due to affordability\n\nissues or weak security of tenure, is stressful. Housing that is\n\ndifficult or expensive to heat can contribute to poor respiratory and\n\ncardiovascular outcomes, while high indoor temperatures can\n\nincrease     cardiovascular     mortality. Indoor      air    pollution harms\n\nrespiratory health and may trigger allergic and irritant reactions,\n\nsuch as asthma. Crowded housing increases the risk of exposure to\n\ninfectious    disease    and    stress.   Inadequate       water    supply       and\n\nsanitation facilities affect food safety and personal hygiene. Urban\n\ndesign that discourages physical activity contributes to obesity and\n\nrelated    conditions,   such    as     diabetes,    and     poor   mental       and\n\ncardiovascular     health.     Unsafe     building   materials      or     building\n\npractices, or building homes in unsafe locations, can expose people\n\nto a range of risks, such as injury due to building collapse.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_221\">      Housing in slums and informal housing pose particular risks\n\nto health. Currently, around 1 billion people live in slum conditions\n\ntoday, which often develop due to exclusion from planning processes.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_222\">                                                                         MSM,J\n                                                                 wp_25275_2020\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_285\">                                   104</span>\n\n\n\nAccording to UN-Habitat, a ―slum household‖ is a group of\n\nindividuals under the same roof, in an urban area, lacking one or\n\nmore of the following: durable housing (housing which fails to\n\nprovide shelter from the elements); sufficient living space; security of\n\ntenure; sanitation and infrastructure; and access to improved\n\n(uncontaminated)      water   sources.   Slum   dwellers   are    therefore\n\nexposed to many of the risks associated with housing, such as\n\nstructurally defective dwellings, inadequate housing facilities and\n\novercrowding, but also face particular health risks from poor\n\nsanitation and unsafe electric connections, toxic building materials,\n\nunvented cooking facilities, and unsafe infrastructure, including\n\nroads. In addition, such settlements are sometimes in locations that\n\nare more likely to expose occupants to hazards such as landslides,\n\nfloods and industrial pollution. In relation to well-being, the lack of\n\nlegal title to homes is stressful and can expose slum dwellers to the\n\nrisk of forced eviction.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_223\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_224\">      Slums    and    informal   settlements    often   house    migrants,\n\nrefugees and internally displaced persons.
