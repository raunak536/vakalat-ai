The appellant inter alia drew attention to the additional written submissions vide\nletter dated 21.04.2021. The appellant further submitted that the respondent had\nreiterated the position taken by the then CPIO and the FAA and that the information\nsought at point nos. (iii), (iv), (vi), (vii) and (viii) of the instant RTI application was\nthird party information and held by the Bank (i.e., the State Bank of India) in fiduciary\ncapacity. The information related to total number of buyers of electoral bonds which did\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                                                                                Page 5 of 16</span>\n not involve any personal details of individuals was also withheld by the respondent. The\nappellant further submitted that the claim of exemption under <a href=\"/doc/938425/\" id=\"a_8\">section 44</a> of State Bank\nof India Act was not sustainable in the eyes of law as the <a href=\"/doc/1971086/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 22</a> of the RTI Act\ngave its provisions overriding effect over all other laws for the time being in force,\nincluding any instrument having effect by virtue of any law other than this Act. Besides,\nthe Electoral Bonds Scheme, 2018, was not a legislation duly enacted by Parliament or\nany State Legislature. It was merely an instrument brought into existence by the\nGovernment of India in exercise of the powers conferred on it by subsection (3) of\n<a href=\"/doc/92969/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 31</a> of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 (2 of 1934). In his additional\nsubmissions submitted by the appellant on 23.04.2021, he emphasized on point no. (v)\nof the RTI application and the related reply received from the then CPIO, SBI, was\nprovided which is reproduced as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">      &quot;The list of all eligible political parties who have secured at least 1% vote in last\n      general election to the Parliament or State Legislature has been prepared from\n      the official website of ECI (eci.nic.in) referring to the results of the respective\n      elections.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_13\">      However, he had filed another RTI application before Election Commission of\nIndia wherein the CPIO, ECI had replied that no such information was compiled in that\nregard. Therefore, the reply given by the respondent was misleading. Further, the SBI\nwas not performing its due diligence to ascertain as to whether or not a political party,\nseeking to redeem electoral bonds it had received by way of contribution from one or\nmore donors, met the 1% vote share requirement mentioned as the eligibility\nrequirement of Electoral Bonds Scheme, 2018. The appellant reiterated that there were\nsufficient public interest grounds to require the disclosure of the information, to ensure\ntransparency of action in order to make Government and its instrumentalities\naccountable to the governed. The appellant pleaded that penal action under <a href=\"/doc/291269/\" id=\"a_11\">section 20\n(1)</a> of the RTI Act be initiated against Shri S.K. Thakur for furnishing false and\nmisleading information and that the information be collected as per <a href=\"/doc/324418/\" id=\"a_12\">section 4 (1) (a)</a> of\nthe RTI Act regarding the number of individuals, HUF, Company, Firm, Charitable\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                                                                                Page 6 of 16</span>\n Trust and others who purchased electoral bonds from each of SBI&#x27;s authorized branches\nduring every phase of sale of electoral bonds.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_14\">5.2   The respondent while defending their case inter alia submitted that in compliance\nof the FAA&#x27;s order they had replied to the appellant vide letter dated 24.11.2020 and\nprovided total number of electoral bonds sold by each of their authorized branches in\nMarch 2018 and April 2018. However, the information pertaining to total number of\nelectoral bonds in each category namely, individuals, HUF, company, firm, etc. was\nvoluminous and not maintained in the ordinary course of business, therefore, was\nexempted under provision of <a href=\"/doc/1322680/\" id=\"a_13\">section 7 (9)</a> of RTI Act. The respondent submitted\nadditional counter submissions vide letter dated 27.09.2021. The respondent submitted\nthat as per the Gazette notification no. 20 dated 02.01.2018 clause 2 (b) &quot;Authorised\nbank&quot; meant the State Bank of lndia authorised to issue and encash the bonds in the\nbranches specified. Further, the eligibility criterion is defined in the Gazette Notification\nNo. 20 dated 02.01.2018 clause 3(3), which reads as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">      &quot;Only the Political Parties registered under <a href=\"/doc/23690917/\" id=\"a_14\">section 29A</a> of the Representation of\n      the People Act, 1951 (43 of 1951) and secured not less than one percent of the\n      votes polled in the last General Election to the house of the People or the\n      Legislative Assembly, as the case may be, shall be eligible to receive the Bond.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\">      Accordingly, SBI referred to the data statistics pertaining to General Elections to\nLok Sabha/General Election or State Legislative Assembly Elections/Vidhansabha,\nwhichever was applicable, as available at the Election Commission of India (ECI)\nwebsite to check a political party&#x27;s eligibility for receiving Electoral Bonds proceeds,\nWith a view to have central control and to ensure that only one Current Account was\nopened for a political party for EB redemption. The respondent stated that SBI at central\nlevel, provided approval to the Authorized Branches for opening of Current Account of\nEligible political parties for the purpose, subject to the fulfillment of extant terms and\nconditions for opening of current account. It was further submitted that the core issue\npertaining to the very validity of the Electoral Bonds Scheme was currently sub judice\nbefore the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court. The Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court vide its interim order\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                                                                                  Page 7 of 16</span>\n dated 12.04.2019 had declined to stay the sale of the electoral bonds, however, directed\nthe political parties to submit the details of donations received by them from the donors\nin a sealed cover to the Election Commission. As per the said interim order, the sealed\ncovers would remain in the custody of the Election Commission of India and the\nElection Commission of India would abide by such further orders as may be passed by\nthe Hon&#x27;ble Court. The respondent further submitted that till date there was no direction\nby the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court to make the said information public. The State Bank of\nIndia was the only Nodal Bank authorised under the said Scheme by the Govt. to sell\nElectoral Bonds and thus in view of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court order, the Bank could\nnot disclose the information even if the Bank was not party to the petition pending\nbefore the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court. The interim stay passed by the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court\nwould have direct bearing on SBI since the entire scheme was under challenge and all\nthe related parties to the said Scheme, be it Election Commission, Government or the\nNodal Bank (State Bank of India) would automatically be bound by the interim stay\norder declared passed by the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court. Therefore, it is humbly prayed\nthat since the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court is already seized of the issue and has refused to\nstay the said scheme till date and since there are no specific directions to make the\ninformation public, the said scheme continued to be valid and continued to cast an\nunambiguous obligation/duty on the Authorized Bank to maintain confidentiality and\ntherefore the Public Authority was right in denying the sought for information.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_16\">6.    The Commission after adverting to the facts and circumstances of the case,\nhearing both the parties and perusal of records, notes that the respondent replied to the\nRTI application dated 28.05.2018 on 15.06.2018.      The respondent have already given\ninformation against point nos.1(i), (ii) and against point nos. (iii) to (v) exemption was\nclaimed.

The logic of balance exercise of judicial power has an assurance of\n\ninstitutional stability and re-organization of boundary of power is implicit in the\n\nConstitutional arrangement.       It is contended that the failings of democracy and\n\ninadequacies of the democratic process cannot be invoked to negate the core of the\n\ndemocratic principle, namely that ultimate sovereignty vests in the people.             Thus,\n\narrangements of governance embodied in the Constitution resulting from the exercise of\n\ntheir free will cannot be used to deprive the ultimate masters of the right of final\n\ndecision over their destiny. It is argued that &quot;juridification of politics and politization of\n\nthe judiciary&quot; would be a loss for both the legislature and judiciary and that judiciary\n\ncannot act as a &quot;censor of all governmental action&quot;. There have been plethora of\n\njudicial orders highlighting the issue of restraint by judicial bodies in substituting their\n\nwisdom over those who have been assigned the function of implementation of Laws.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_42\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"50531798\" id=\"span_32\">In that regard, in <a href=\"/doc/50531798/\" id=\"a_45\">Manohar Lal Sharma v Union of India</a> [(2016) 13 SCC 710], the\n\nSupreme Court declined to entertain a PIL seeking the Court&#x27;s directions to restrain the\n\nunion government from incurring security and other expenses with respect to certain\n\nindividuals in the state of Jammu and Kashmir, holding that &quot;nationally sensitive issues\n\nconcerning the security of the nation ...should be left to the executive ... and that these\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">                                                                                  Page 14 of 16</span>\n writs are judicially unmanageable.&quot; It is relevant to quote the landmark judgment given\n\nby the Constitution Bench in Re: Special Reference No 1 of 2012, [(2012), 10 SCC 1]:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">      &quot;The Supreme Parliament and the legislatures, composed as they are of the\n      representatives of the people, are supposed to know and be aware of the needs of the\n      people and what is good and bad for them.
