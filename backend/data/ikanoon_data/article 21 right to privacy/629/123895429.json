That it is submitted that even prior to the introduction of\n       a <a href=\"/doc/1732853/\" id=\"a_20\">Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013</a>, <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 375</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_22\">376</a>\n       of the IPC were gender specific and it was decided by the\n       Legislature to retain the same. Moreover, it was strong\n       demand of various women group that the said Sections should\n       remain gender specific. It is submitted that the <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_23\">Protection of\n       Children from Sexual Offences Act</a> (POCSO) covers all sexual\n       offences against a &quot;child&quot;. As per <a href=\"/doc/254501/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 2(d)</a> of POCSO, a\n       &quot;child&quot; is defined as any person below the age of 18 years,\n       meaning thereby that the Act protects both male and the\n       female child against sexual offences. Further, <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 377</a> of\n       the IPC provides as under:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">               &quot;377. Unnatural offences.--Whoever voluntarily has\n               carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any\n               man, woman or animal, shall be punished with\n               imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment of either\n               description for a term which may extend to ten years,\n               and shall also be liable to fine.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">               Explanation.--Penetration is sufficient to constitute the\n               carnal intercourse necessary to the offence described in\n               this section.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">        Further, vide Judgment dated 6.9.2018 in the case of Navtej\n       Singh Johar &amp; Ors. Union of India [WP(Crl) No. 76 of 2016],\n       the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court, with utmost clarity has held that\n       any act of the description covered under Section 377 between\n       two individuals without consent of any one of them would\n       invite penal liability under <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 377</a> of the IPC. Therefore,\n       the ambit of Section 377 as it exists today would cover all non-\n       consensual unnatural sexual acts by any person. It is thus\n       submitted that keeping in view the ambit of the <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_27\">POCSO Act</a>\n       which covers all forms of sexual offences against minors and\n       <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 377</a> of the IPC, it was felt that the existing definition of\n       rape under Section 375 should be left untouched as the said\n       provision alongwith Section 377 and the provisions under the\n       <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_29\">POCSO Act</a> are adequate to cover all sexual offences.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_8\">3.
