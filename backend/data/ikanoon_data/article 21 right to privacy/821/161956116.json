The factual background of the case is that a show cause notice\ndated 01.04.2023 was issued by learned District Magistrate-cum-Deputy\nCommissioner, Ramgarh against the petitioner in CCA Case No. 23 of\n2023 stating therein as to why not an order under <a href=\"/doc/138692766/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 3(a)(b)(i)(ii)</a> of\nJharkhand Control of Crimes Act, 2002 be passed, as per report\nsubmitted by Superintendent of Police, Ramgarh vide letter no. 134/DCB\ndated 28.03.2023.

Assailing the impugned order, learned counsel for the petitioner\ncontends that the impugned order is patently illegal and does not come\nwithin the ambit and scope of <a href=\"/doc/138692766/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 3</a> of Jharkhand Control of Crimes\nAct, 2002. The impugned order has been passed merely on the proposal\nof Superintendent of Police on the basis of two criminal cases registered\nagainst the petitioner under the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_17\">Indian Penal Code</a> (in short <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_18\">I.P.C</a>).\nNeither the petitioner is a habitual criminal nor does he belong to any\ngang of known criminals rather he is a law abiding person in the village\n                                                         W.P.(Cr.) (D.B.) No.551 of 2023\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                      3</span>\n\n\nand due to village politics and political vendetta, he has been involved in\naforesaid two criminal cases in quick succession within a span of 15 days\nand branded by police as &quot;anti-social element&quot;. The impugned order is\nbased on extraneous considerations de hors the factual aspects of the\ncase. Fundamental right of life and personal liberty which inheres &quot;the\nright of privacy&quot; is most cherished right of a citizen of India guaranteed\nby <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_19\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India and which is not even\nsuspended at the time of Emergency, is being violated by putting\nunreasonable restrictions on the movement of the petitioner without\nfollowing the &quot;procedure established by law&quot;. The petitioner is a\nvictim of executive excess, hence, directly took shelter of this Hon&#x27;ble\nCourt for efficacious remedy, which cannot be available through slow\nprocess of appeal provided under <a href=\"/doc/35623213/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 6</a> of the said Act and without\ncompromising with his personal liberty.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_8\">4.       It is further submitted that mere providing the list of first\ninformation report filed against the petitioner does not mean setting out\nthe general nature of material allegation. No specific overt act or any\nother reason has been mentioned in the impugned order justifying the\nexercise of jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/138692766/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 3</a> of the Jharkhand Control of\nCrimes Act, 2002. Petitioner is on bail in the first case i.e. Patratu P.S.\nCase No. 76/2022 and in the second case i.e. in Patratu P.S. Case No. 70\nof 2022 he is not named in the FIR and he is co-operating in the\ninvestigation as and when required by the investigating officer.\nTherefore, impugned order is not legally sustainable and fit to be set\naside. Finally, it is pointed out that in the W.P. (Cr.) (D.B.) No. 542 /2023\narising out of the same CCA Case, the order passed by the District\nMagistrate under <a href=\"/doc/138692766/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 3</a> of the said act against co-accused, Nishi\nPandey @ Nishee has been quashed by Co-ordinate Division Bench of\nthis Court.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_9\">                                                        W.P.(Cr.) (D.B.) No.551 of 2023\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                      4</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_10\">5.        Per Contra, learned counsel for the respondent pointing out the\nmaterials depicted in counter affidavit filed by SDPO, Patratu has\nsubmitted that petitioner belongs to the &quot;Pandey Gang&quot;, active in the\nvicinity of Ramgarh, District and indulge in realising levy/ extortion\nfrom the industrialists by way of committing crimes like murder,\nextortion, robbery, firing, explosion, attempt to murder, stopping the\nongoing work, intimidating and threatening the stakeholders. Petitioner\nhas two criminal antecedents and charge sheet has been submitted in one\nof the above criminal cases along with dreaded criminals like Nishi\nPandey and members of &quot;Pandey Gang&quot;. It is also submitted that on the\nbasis of local inputs and intelligence sharing, it has surfaced that the\npetitioner indirectly, by associating with dreaded criminal like Vikash\nTiwari and Nishi Pandey, is committing crimes like threatening and\nintimidating business-men, traders, contractors etc. for extorting money,\ncreating fear and panic among them. As such disturbing peace, normalcy\nand tranquility at Patratu and adjoining areas and also disrupting the\neconomic activities of the region.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_11\">6.      It is further pleaded that in the Panchayat Election, 2022, the\ncandidates were threatened to abstain from filing nomination form by\nabducting of some candidates by the petitioner. Therefore, if the\nactivities of petitioner are not restricted, he may indulge in commission\nof further offences. Hence, impugned order does not warrant any\ninterference. A further objection has been taken that the petitioner has to\ntake legal recourse as prescribed under law by filing an appeal rather\nthan to move before this Hon&#x27;ble Court directly, hence, this petition is fit\nto be dismissed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_12\">7.        On the basis of a report contained in memo no. 134/ DCB\ndated 28.03.2023 of the Superintendent of Police addressed to District\nMagistrate/ Deputy Commissioner, Ramgarh, CCA Case No. 23/2023\nwas registered against the petitioner. Through the aforesaid memo no.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_13\">                                                                  W.P.(Cr.) (D.B.) No.551 of 2023\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                             5</span>\n\n\n134 the Superintendent of Police, Ramgarh referred a proposal with\nrecommendation that the petitioner is required to mark his attendance on\nevery day at the police station. In the Show cause notice dated\n01.04.2023 (Annexure 1), the Deputy Commissioner-cum-District\nMagistrate, Ramgarh             referred to two         criminal      cases showing\ninvolvement of petitioner in connection with Patratu P.S. Case No.\n76/2022 &amp; Patratu P.S. Case No. 70 of 2022. The petitioner submitted his\ndetailed show cause reply (Annexure 2) but surprisingly a very short and\ncryptic order mentioning wrong Sections and Sub-Clauses of <a href=\"/doc/138692766/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 3</a>\nof the Jharkhand Crime Control Act, 2002 was passed by the District\nMagistrate only on the basis of registration of two criminal cases against\nthe petitioner.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">8.     We have considered the whole gamut of the case and examined\nthe records. <a href=\"/doc/111914719/\" id=\"a_24\">The Jharkhand Control of Crimes Act, 2002</a> is a Preventive\nDetention Law and was enacted for the control and suppression of anti-\nsocial elements with a view to maintenance of public order. Since the\nprovisions of the Act tend to take over the right to life and personal\nliberty of a citizen, these must be construed literally in strict manner.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_15\">9.     <a href=\"/doc/138692766/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 3</a> of the Jharkhand Control of Crimes Act is quoted as\nunder:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">          &quot;3.

The provisions under <a href=\"/doc/138692766/\" id=\"a_27\">section 3</a> of the Jharkhand Control of\nCrimes Act, 2002 provide that the District Magistrate (in this case, the\nDeputy Commissioner) can pass an order of externment or any other\norder in the nature of requiring the person to notify his movement,\nprohibit or restrict possession or use of such article which may be\n                                                        W.P.(Cr.)

In the first place, we\nneed to indicate that the order dated 21st July 2023 has been passed for a\nmaximum period of six months and no special reason has been recorded\nfor passing of the said order for the maximum period at one go.\nSecondly, the provisions under clause (b) to sub-section (3) of <a href=\"/doc/138692766/\" id=\"a_28\">section 3</a>\nof the Jharkhand Control of Crimes Act, 2002 indicates that the Deputy\nCommissioner has three options under clause (b); either (i) to require the\nperson to notify his movement; or (ii) to prohibit or restrict possession of\nany article; or (iii) to direct him to conduct himself in a particular\nmanner. The fact that an order under clause (a) to sub-section (3) of\n<a href=\"/doc/138692766/\" id=\"a_29\">section 3</a> which requires a person to remove himself outside the District\nor a part thereof has not been passed against the petitioner is quite\nrelevant in the sense that the Deputy Commissioner in passing the order\ndated 21st July 2023 seems to have accepted the position that the\npresence of the petitioner within the District of Ramgarh is not\nprejudicial to public order.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_25\">11.      In the show-cause notice (Annexure 1), there is no whisper\nabout &quot;general nature of the material allegations&quot; except pendency of\ntwo criminal cases against the petitioner. In the impugned order also\n(Annexure 3) the satisfaction of District Magistrate is based upon only\nabove two cases. There is no statement of facts showing that the\npetitioner is a member of any gang and his movements in the locality is\ncausing disturbance to the peace and public order. In Patratu P.S. Case\nNo. 76/2022, the petitioner is on bail and charge sheet has been\nsubmitted. In Patratu P.S. Case No. 70/2022 petitioner is not named in\nthe FIR which is lodged against unknown miscreants and there is no\ndirect allegation against him for commission of any crime. There is no\nmaterial placed on record that the petitioner is not abiding the terms and\nconditions of bail bond or not co-operating in the investigation of the\ncase.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_26\">                                                            W.P.(Cr.)

For passing an order under <a href=\"/doc/138692766/\" id=\"a_30\">section 3</a> of the Jharkhand Control of\nCrimes Act, 2002, this must appear from the records that the person is an\nanti-social element. Sub-section (d) to <a href=\"/doc/144034915/\" id=\"a_31\">section 2</a> of the Jharkhand Control\nof Crimes Act, 2002 which defined the expression &quot;Anti Social Element&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">reads as under:\n</blockquote><pre id=\"pre_2\">           &quot;(d)    &quot;Anti-social element&quot; means a person who-\n           (i)     either by himself or as a member of or leader of a gang,\n</pre><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">           habitually commits or attempts to commit or abets the commission\n           of offences punishable under Chapter XVI or Chapter XVII of the\n           <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_32\">Indian Penal Code</a>; or\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">           (ii)    habitually commits or abets the commission of offences\n           under the Suppression of Immoral Traffic in Women and Girls Act,\n           1956;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">           (iii)   who by words or otherwise promotes or attempts to promote,\n           on grounds of religion, race, language, caste or community or other\n           grounds whatsoever, feelings of enmity or hatred between different\n           religions, racial or language groups or castes or communities; or\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">           (iv)    has been found habitually passing indecent remarks to, or\n           teasing women or girls; or\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">           (v)     who has been convicted of an offence under <a href=\"/doc/86485406/\" id=\"a_33\">sections 25</a>,<a href=\"/doc/93439503/\" id=\"a_34\">26</a>,\n           <a href=\"/doc/151435026/\" id=\"a_35\">27</a>, <a href=\"/doc/16718020/\" id=\"a_36\">28</a> or 29 of the <a href=\"/doc/1934415/\" id=\"a_37\">Arms Act</a> of 1959.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"890637\" id=\"span_8\">13.         The impugned order records that the activities of the\npetitioner attract the provision under Clause (i) of Sub-Section (d) to\n<a href=\"/doc/144034915/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 2</a> of Jharkhand Control of Crimes Act, 2002. The term\n&quot;habitually&quot; has not been defined in the said Act, but has been explained\nby the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/890637/\" id=\"a_39\">Vijay Narayan Singh V. State\nof Bihar</a> reported in (1984) 3 SCC 14 wherein the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme\nCourt has held as under:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">            &quot;31. It is seen from <a href=\"/doc/111149909/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 12</a> of the Act that it makes provision for\n            the detention of an anti-social element. If a person is not an anti-\n            social element, he cannot be detained under the Act. The detaining\n            authority should, therefore, be satisfied that the person against\n            whom an order is made under <a href=\"/doc/111149909/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 12</a> of the Act is an anti-social\n                                                 W.P.(Cr.) (D.B.) No.551 of 2023\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                             9</span>\n\n\nelement as defined in <a href=\"/doc/51984158/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 2(d)</a> of the Act. Sub-clauses (ii), (iii)\nand (v) of <a href=\"/doc/51984158/\" id=\"a_43\">Section 2(d)</a> of the Act which are not quite relevant for\nthe purposes of this case may be omitted from consideration for the\npresent. The two other sub-clauses which need to be examined\nclosely are sub clauses (i) and (iv) of <a href=\"/doc/51984158/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 2(d)</a>. Under sub-clause\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">(i) of <a href=\"/doc/51984158/\" id=\"a_45\">Section 2(d)</a> of the Act, a person who either by himself or as a\nmember of or leader of a gang habitually commits or attempts to\ncommit or abets the commission of offences punishable under\nChapter XVI dealing with offences affecting the human body or\nChapter XVII dealing with offences against property, of the Penal\nCode, 1860 is considered to be an anti-social element. Under sub-\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_29\">clause (iv) of <a href=\"/doc/51984158/\" id=\"a_46\">Section 2(d)</a> of the Act, a person who has been\nhabitually passing indecent remarks to, or teasing women or girls, is\nan anti-social element. In both these sub clauses, the word\n&quot;habitually&quot;   is   used.   The    expression    &quot;habitually&quot;         means\n&quot;repeatedly&quot; or &quot;persistently&quot;. It implies a thread of continuity\nstringing together similar repetitive acts. Repeated, persistent and\nsimilar, but not isolated, individual and dissimilar acts are necessary\nto justify an inference of habit. It connotes frequent commission of\nacts or omissions of the same kind referred to in each of the said sub\nclauses or an aggregate of similar acts or omissions. This appears to\nbe clear from the use of the word &quot;habitually&quot; separately in sub-\nclause (i), sub-clause (ii) and sub-clause (iv) of <a href=\"/doc/51984158/\" id=\"a_47\">Section 2(d)</a> and not\nin sub clauses (iii) and (v) of <a href=\"/doc/51984158/\" id=\"a_48\">Section 2(d)</a>. If the State Legislature\nhad intended that a commission of two or more acts or omissions\nreferred to in any of the sub-clauses (i) to (v) of <a href=\"/doc/51984158/\" id=\"a_49\">Section 2(d)</a> was\nsufficient to make a person an &quot;anti-social element&quot;, the definition\nwould have run as &quot;Anti-social element&quot; means &quot;a person who\nhabitually is. ..&quot;. As <a href=\"/doc/51984158/\" id=\"a_50\">Section 2(d)</a> of the Act now stands, whereas\nunder sub-clause (iii) or sub-clause (v) of <a href=\"/doc/51984158/\" id=\"a_51\">Section 2(d)</a> a single act\nor omission referred to in them may be enough to treat the person\nconcerned as an &#x27;antisocial element&#x27;, in the case of sub-clause (i),\nsub-clause (ii) or sub-clause (iv), there should be a repetition of acts\nor omissions of the same kind referred to in sub-clause (i), sub-\nclause (ii) or in sub-clause (iv) by the person concerned to treat him\n                                                            W.P.(Cr.) (D.B.) No.551 of 2023\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                         10</span>\n\n\n            as an &quot;anti-social element&quot;. Commission of an act or omission\n            referred to in one of the sub-clauses (i), (ii) and (iv) and of another\n            act or omission referred to in any other of the said sub-clauses\n            would not be sufficient to treat a person as an &quot;anti-social element&quot;.\n            A single act or omission falling under subclause (i) and a single act\n            or omission falling under sub-clause (iv) of <a href=\"/doc/51984158/\" id=\"a_52\">Section 2(d)</a> cannot,\n            therefore, be characterized as a habitual act or omission referred to\n            in either of them. Because the idea of &quot;habit&quot; involves an element of\n            persistence and a tendency to repeat the acts or omissions of the\n            same class or kind, if the acts or omissions in question are not of the\n            same kind or even if they are of the same kind when they are\n            committed with a long interval of time between them they cannot be\n            treated as habitual ones.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_30\">14. Taking into notice the overall facts and circumstances of the case,\nwe are of the opinion that the very foundational facts for initiation of\nproceeding under <a href=\"/doc/138692766/\" id=\"a_53\">Section 3</a> are lacking in this case; Notwithstanding\nthat, the impugned order has been passed directing the petitioner to mark\nhis attendance before the officer-in-charge of Patratu Police Station at 10\nA.M. daily, does not satisfy the requirements of law and violative of\nright of the petitioner as guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_54\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution\nof India.
