This Letters Patent Appeal has been filed by the\nappellant-original petitioner challenging the order of the learned\nSingle Judge dated 17.06.2014 passed in Special Civil Application\nNo.8274 of 2014, by which the learned Single Judge has dismissed\nthe writ petition filed by the petitioner.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_3\">2.             A short question that arises for consideration in this\nLetters Patent Appeal is whether a BPL Card holder is entitled to\napply for certified copies of the index as well as registered\ndocuments along with the copies of annexures thereto for a period\nof seven years i.e. from 2005 to 2011, which is about 11780\nregistered documents, free of cost, under proviso to <a href=\"/doc/683731/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 7 (5)</a> of\nthe Right to Information Act, 2005 without disclosing as to whether\nhis requirement is for any larger public interest as the documents\ndemanded by him are public documents of third parties.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">3.             The brief facts of this case are that the appellant-\noriginal petitioner made an application in October, 2011 under the\nprovisions of <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_2\">Right to Information Act, 2005</a> (for short &#x27;the Act&#x27;)\nseeking     information     from   the    Information   Officer   and Sub-\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                   Page 2 of 8</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">        C/LPA/1102/2014                                     JUDGMENT\n\n\n\n\nRegistrar, Siddhapur. By virtue of the said application, the\npetitioner demanded certified copies of all the documents with\ntheir annexures which were presented and registered in the office\nof Sub-Registrar in the span of seven years i.e. from 2005 to 2011.\nBy the same application, he also prayed to supply certified copies\nof the index (wherein entry of registered documents are made) in\nrespect of all documents, which came to be registered in the office\nof Sub-Registrar, Siddhapur during aforesaid span of about seven\nyears i.e. from 2005 to 2011. The Information Officer in the office\nof the Sub-Registrar found that during the period in question i.e.\nfrom 2005 to 24.10.2011 about 11780 documents were registered.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">3.1         Having regard to the fact that the petitioner demanded\ncertified copies of about 11780 documents and certified copies for\nequal number (i.e. 11780) of index, the respondent-authority\ncalculated the fees, which were payable by the appellant-original\npetitioner if he wanted to have copies of the documents. According\nto the calculation made by the respondent-authority, the appellant-\noriginal petitioner was required to pay an amount of Rs.38,87,400/-\nincluding the copies of the documents demanded by him. However,\nthe petitioner demanded the said documents free of any cost/fees.\nSince the fee was not paid by the appellant-original petitioner, he\npreferred   an     appeal   before   the      respondent   No.3-Appellant\nAuthority and Inspector of Registration. The said appeal was\ndismissed on 03.01.2012. Aggrieved by the said order, the\nappellant-original petitioner again filed an appeal before the\nrespondent No.4-Chief Information Commissioner and the said\nappeal was also dismissed on 01.02.2014 on the ground that the\ninformation/documents related to personal information of third\nparty can be made available only if larger public interest warrants\nthe disclosure and since the petitioner has not mentioned, in his\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                Page 3 of 8</span>\n         C/LPA/1102/2014                                 JUDGMENT\n\n\n\n\napplication any details reflecting that the documents/information\nrelated to third party is demanded for public interest and therefore,\nthe respondents were right to refuse the request of the petitioner\nin light of the provision under <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 8</a> and <a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 11</a> of the Act.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_7\">4.           Learned counsel for the appellant has urged that the\nappellant is a person, who belongs to below poverty line strata and\ntherefore, in view of <a href=\"/doc/683731/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 7(5)</a> of the Act, he is not required to\npay any fees. Further he urged that in view of <a href=\"/doc/1505894/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 6(2)</a> of the\nAct, he can seek for any information without disclosing any reason\nfor the same.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_8\">5.           We repeatedly asked Mr.Vijay H.Nangesh, learned\ncounsel for the appellant to show the reason as to why the\ndocuments registered for seven years are required by the\nappellant, who belongs to BPL category. Mr.Nangesh could not\ngive any reason and repeatedly argued that there is no requirement\nin the Act to disclose any reason. The appellant has not stated\neither in the petition or in the appeal that he is a public spirited\ncitizen and has filed any public interest litigation in the Court.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_9\">6.           The learned Single Judge has succinctly considered all\nthe provisions of law and also the question as to whether the\nregistered documents of other persons could be demanded by the\npetitioner and whether the petitioner is liable to pay any fees or not\nand has come to the conclusion that the appellant-original\npetitioner has failed to make out any ground to interfere with the\nimpugned orders passed by competent authorities. The request\nmade by the petitioner has been rejected by the authorities on the\nground that the petitioner is not seeking the information for\nestablishing any public interest.\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                Page 4 of 8</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\">         C/LPA/1102/2014                                     JUDGMENT\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_11\">7.           Before adverting to the facts of the case, it cannot be\ndisputed that under the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_7\">Right to Information Act, 2005</a>, right to\nseek information is a fundamental right flowing from <a href=\"/doc/1142233/\" id=\"a_8\">Article 19(1)</a>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"110957682\" id=\"span_4\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"539407\" id=\"span_5\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"112850760\" id=\"span_6\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"438670\" id=\"span_7\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"125596\" id=\"span_8\">(a) of the Constitution of India as held by the Apex Court in the\ncase of <a href=\"/doc/125596/\" id=\"a_9\">Bennett Coleman v.

The information\nsought under the Act intends to promote an accountability and\ntransparency.      However,   whether         private   documents      without\nimpinging upon the right to privacy could be exempted from public\ndisclosure is a question which is to be decided in this petition. Even\nif this information may not be treated to be a personal information\nas the documents are normally made available for inspection and\nsearch to public at a large and also allowing through copies by\npaying requisite fees, then the question arises regarding the\ninformation asked for by the appellant-original petitioner, who\nbelongs to BPL category, requires large number of manpower and\nhuman hours to prepare and to deliver the said information to the\nappellant and the expenses involved upon the public exchequer is\nquantified to the extent of Rs.38,87,400/- which was demanded but\nnot paid by the appellant. He has also refrained from disclosing the\nreasons as to whether such voluminous information is required for\nany public purpose. Another factors which arise for consideration is\nwhether it is justified to part with such information at the cost of\npublic exchequer and whether the request made by the appellant\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                Page 5 of 8</span>\n         C/LPA/1102/2014                                         JUDGMENT\n\n\n\n\nfor supplying such voluminous information amounts to abuse of the\nprocess of law.</span></span></span></span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_13\">8.           At the outset, it is certain that the information sought\nfor by the appellant contains 11780 documents which was\nregistered during the period from 2005 to 2011. Since the\nappellants    belongs     to   BPL     category,   the    cost    of   servicing\ninformation, mainly copies of huge documents, as per prescribed\nfee rules would be very high and certainly will have a impact on the\npublic exchequer. The respondents have set up a machinery for\ngranting certified copies of registered documents upon depositing\nappropriate fees and they also have provisions for inspection and\nsearch of such registered documents. Since the information sought\nis voluminous, it would indeed be uneconomical to make copies of\nevery piece of paper contained in the relevant files. In our opinion,\nthe appellant-original petitioner claiming to be a BPL Card holder\ndemanding voluminous information without assigning any reason is\nitself indicative of abuse of process of law. The legislation has\nmandated that BPL Card holder are exempted from paying any fees\nfor seeking information under the Act so that the persons who are\nfinancially weak may not be deprived for want of such information\nand equality may prevail amongst all the sections of the society.\nTherefore, in their wisdom the legislation has conferred this right\nto BPL Card holder to have excess to information free of cost.\nHowever,     photocopying       such       documents     will    certainly   kill\nthousands of human hours as well as manpower and supplying such\nvoluminous information under the guise of BPL at the cost of public\nexchequer cannot, at any stretch of imagination, be the object of\nany legislation. Moreover, acceding to such request may be akin to\nopening Pandora&#x27;s box.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                     Page 6 of 8</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_14\">         C/LPA/1102/2014                                JUDGMENT\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_15\">9.           It is settled proposition that the Right to Freedom of\nSpeech and Expression enshrined under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_15\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the\nConstitution of India encompasses the right to impart and receive\ninformation. The Right to Information has been stated to be one of\nthe important facets of proper governance. However, like any other\nfreedom, this freedom also has limitations. The value of any\nfreedom is determined by the extent to which the citizens are able\nto enjoy such freedom. <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_16\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution itself is\ncontrolled by reasonable restrictions imposed by the State by\nenacting various laws from time to time.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_16\">10.          Access to information is a statutory right. This right, as\nindicated above, is subject to certain constitutional and statutory\nlimitations. <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_17\">The Act</a> itself spells out exempted information as well\nas the areas where the Act would be inoperative. The competent\nauthorities have been vested with the power to decline furnishing\nof an information under certain circumstances and in the specified\nsituations. For disclosure of information, which involves the\nquestion of prejudice to a third party, the concerned authority is\nrequired to issue notice to the third party who can make a\nrepresentation and such representation is to be dealt with in\naccordance with the provisions of the Act. Thus, it involves and\nadjudicatory process wherein the exercise of powers and passing of\nthe orders by the authorities concerned under the provisions of the\nAct cannot be arbitrary. It has to be in consonance with the\nprinciples of natural justice and the procedure evolved by such\nauthority. It is also required to bear in mind as to how far the right\nto information is affected where information sought for is denied or\nwhether the information asked for is exempted or impinges upon\nthe right to privacy or where it falls in the &#x27;no go area&#x27; of\napplicability of the Act. It is not mandatory for the authorities to\nallow all requests for information in a routine manner. <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_18\">The Act</a>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                Page 7 of 8</span>\n               C/LPA/1102/2014                              JUDGMENT\n\n\n\n\nimposes an obligation upon the authorities to examine each matter\nseriously being fully cautious of its consequences and effects on the\nrights of others. It may be a simple query for information but can\nhave far reaching consequences upon the right of a third party or\nan individual with regard to whom such information is sought.\nUndue inroad into the right to privacy of an individual which is\nprotected under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_19\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India or any other\nlaw in force would not be permissible. However, in the present\ncase, the appellant has asked for copies of registered documents\nbelonging to various other parties and <a href=\"/doc/110957682/\" id=\"a_20\">in that case</a>, it would be next\nto impossible to issue notices to all such parties and to adjudicate\ntheir matters.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_17\">11.                In our view, the learned Single Judge has rightly upheld\nthe orders passed by the authorities below and rejected the claim\nof the appellant-original petitioner as the application made by the\nappellant is nothing but an abuse of process of the Act and appears\nto have been made by the appellant-original petitioner on\ninstruction of someone which has not been disclosed. There is no\ndenial of information to the appellant and that the authorities have\nacted properly as per the provisions of the Act.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_18\">12.                For the aforesaid reasons, we do not find any merits in\nthis appeal. This appeal fails and is, accordingly, dismissed.
