Conclusions in seriatim\n\n\n\nA.   Prologue:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_6\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">     Life and death as concepts have invited many a thinker,\n\nphilosopher, writer and physician to define or describe them.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">\f                                4</span>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">Sometimes attempts have been made or efforts have been\n\nundertaken to gloriously paint the pictures of both in many a\n\ncolour and shade. Swami Vivekananda expects one to\n\nunderstand that life is the lamp that is constantly burning out\n\nand further suggests that if one wants to have life, one has to\n\ndie every moment for it. John Dryden, an illustrious English\n\nauthor, considers life a cheat and says that men favour the\n\ndeceit. No one considers that the goal of life is the grave. Léon\n\nMontenaeken would like to describe life as short, a little\n\nhoping, a little dreaming and then good night. The famous\n\npoet Dylan Thomas would state ―do not go gentle into that\n\ngood night.‖ One may like to compare life with constant\n\nrestless moment spent in fear of extinction of a valued vapour;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">and another may sincerely believe that it is beyond any\n\nconceivable metaphor. A metaphysical poet like John Donne,\n\nin his inimitable manner, says:-\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">     ―One short sleep past, we wake eternally, And death\n     shall be no more; death, thou shalt die‖.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">     Some would say with profound wisdom that life is to be\n\nlived only for pleasure and others with equal wise pragmatism\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">\f                                 5</span>\n\n\nwould proclaim that life is meant for the realization of divinity\n\nwithin one because that is where one feels the ―self‖, the\n\nindividuality   and   one‘s   own    real   identity.   Dharmaraj\n\nYudhisthira may express that though man sees that death\n\ntakes place every moment, yet he feels that the silence of\n\ndeath would not disturb him and nothing could be more\n\nsurprising than the said thought. Yet others feel that one\n\nshould never be concerned about the uncertain death and live\n\nlife embracing hedonism till death comes. Charvaka, an\n\nancient philosopher, frowns at the conception of re-birth and\n\ncommends for living life to the fullest. Thus, death is\n\ncomplicated and life is a phenomenon which possibly intends\n\nto keep away from negatives that try to attack the virtue and\n\nvigour of life from any arena. In spite of all the statements,\n\nreferences and utterances, be it mystical, philosophical or\n\npsychological, the fact remains, at least on the basis of\n\nconceptual majority, that people love to live – whether at\n\neighty or eighteen – and do not, in actuality, intend to treat life\n\nlike an ―autumn leaf‖. As Alfred Tennyson says:-\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">\f                                6</span>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">     ―No life that breathes with human breath has ever\n     truly longed for death.‖\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">2.   The perception is not always the same at every stage.\n\nThere comes a phase in life when the spring of life is frozen,\n\nthe rain of circulation becomes dry, the movement of body\n\nbecomes motionless, the rainbow of life becomes colourless\n\nand the word ‗life‘ which one calls a dance in space and time\n\nbecomes still and blurred and the inevitable death comes near\n\nto hold it as an octopus gripping firmly with its tentacles so\n\nthat the person ―shall rise up never‖.        The ancient Greet\n\nphilosopher, Epicurus, has said, although in a different\n\ncontext:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">                ―Why should I fear death?\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">                If I am, then death is not.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">                If death is, then I am not.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">                Why should I fear that which\n                can only exist when I do not?‖\n\n     But there is a fallacy in the said proposition. It is because\n\nmere existence does not amount to presence. And sometimes\n\nthere is a feebleness of feeling of presence in semi-reality state\n\nwhen the idea of conceptual identity is lost, quality of life is\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">\f                                7</span>\n\n\nsunk and the sanctity of life is destroyed and such destruction\n\nis denial of real living. Ernest Hemingway, in his book ‗The Old\n\nMan and the Sea‘, expounds the idea that man can be\n\ndestroyed, but cannot be defeated. In a certain context, it can\n\nbe said, life sans dignity is an unacceptable defeat and life\n\nthat meets death with dignity is a value to be aspired for and a\n\nmoment for celebration.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_8\">3.   The question that emerges is whether a person should be\n\nallowed to remain in such a stage of incurable passivity\n\nsuffering from pain and anguish in the name of Hippocratic\n\noath or, for that matter, regarding the suffering as only a state\n\nof mind and a relative perception or treating the utterance of\n\ndeath as a ―word infinitely terrible‖ to be a rhetoric without\n\nany meaning. In contradistinction to the same, the question\n\nthat arises is should he not be allowed to cross the doors of\n\nlife and enter,   painlessly and with dignity, into the dark\n\ntunnel of death whereafter it is said that there is resplendence.\n\nIn delineation of such an issue, there emerges the question in\n\nlaw – should he or she be given such treatment which has\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">\f                                8</span>\n\n\ncome into existence with the passage of time and progress of\n\nmedical technology so that he/she exists possibly not realizing\n\nwhat happens around him/her or should his/her individual\n\ndignity be sustained with concern by smoothening the process\n\nof dying.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_9\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_10\">4.   The legal question does not singularly remain in the set\n\nframework of law or, for that matter, morality or dilemma of\n\nthe doctors but also encapsulates social values and the family\n\nmindset to make a resolute decision which ultimately is a\n\ncause of concern for all. There is also another perspective to it.\n\nA family may not desire to go ahead with the process of\n\ntreatment but is compelled to do so under social pressure\n\nespecially in a different milieu, and in the case of an\n\nindividual, there remains a fear of being branded that he/she,\n\nin spite of being able to provide the necessary treatment to the\n\npatient, has chosen not to do so. The social psyche constantly\n\nmakes him/her feel guilty. The collective puts him at the\n\ncrossroads between socially carved out ‗meaningful guilt‘ and\n\nhis constant sense of rationality and individual responsibility.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">\f                               9</span>\n\n\nThere has to be a legalistic approach which is essential to\n\nclear the maze and instill awareness that gradually melts the\n\nidea of ―meaningful guilt‖ and ushers in an act of ―affirmative\n\nhuman purpose‖ that puts humanness on a high pedestal.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_11\">5.   There is yet another aspect. In an action of this nature,\n\nthere can be abuse by the beneficiaries who desire that the\n\npatient‘s heart should stop so that his property is inherited in\n\npromptitude and in such a situation, the treating physicians\n\nare also scared of collusion that may invite the wrath of\n\ncriminal law as well as social stigma. The medical, social and\n\nethical apprehensions further cloud their mind to take a\n\ndecision. The apprehension, the cultural stigma, the social\n\nreprehension, the allegation of conspiracy, the ethical dilemma\n\nand eventually the shadow between the individual desire and\n\nthe collective expression distances the reality and it is here\n\nthat the law has to have an entry to alleviate the agony of the\n\nindividual and dispel the collective attributes and perceptions\n\nso that the imbroglio is clear. Therefore, the heart of the\n\nmatter is whether the law permits for accelerating the process\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">\f                               10</span>\n\n\nof dying sans suffering when life is on the path of inevitable\n\ndecay and if so, at what stage and to what extent. The said\n\nissue warrants delineation from various perspectives.\n\n\nB.   Contentions in the Writ Petition:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_12\">6.   The instant Writ Petition preferred under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_5\">Article 32</a> of the\n\nConstitution of India by the petitioner, a registered society,\n\nseeks to declare ―right to die with dignity‖ as a fundamental\n\nright within the fold of ―right to live with dignity‖ guaranteed\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_6\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution; to issue directions to the\n\nrespondents to adopt suitable procedure in consultation with\n\nthe State Governments, where necessary; to ensure that\n\npersons of deteriorated health or terminally ill patients should\n\nbe able to execute a document titled ―My Living Will and\n\nAttorney Authorisation‖ which can be presented to the\n\nhospital for appropriate action in the event of the executant\n\nbeing admitted to the hospital with serious illness which may\n\nthreaten termination of the life of the executant; to appoint a\n\ncommittee of experts including doctors, social scientists and\n\nlawyers to study into the aspect of issuing guidelines as to the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">\f                                11</span>\n\n\n―Living Wills‖; and to issue such further appropriate directions\n\nand guidelines as may be necessary.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_13\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_14\">7.   It is asserted that every individual is entitled to take\n\nhis/her decision about the continuance or discontinuance of\n\nlife when the process of death has already commenced and\n\nhe/she has reached an irreversible permanent progressive\n\nstate where death is not far away. It is contended that each\n\nindividual has an inherent right to die with dignity which is an\n\ninextricable facet of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_7\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. That apart,\n\nit is set forth that right to die sans pain and suffering is\n\nfundamental to one‘s bodily autonomy and such integrity does\n\nnot remotely accept any effort that puts the individual on life\n\nsupport without any ray of hope and on the contrary, the\n\nwhole regime of treatment continues in spite of all being aware\n\nthat it is a Sisyphean endeavour, an effort to light a bulb\n\nwithout the filament or to expect a situation to be in an apple\n\npie order when it is actually in a state of chaos.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"110957682\" id=\"span_37\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"845196\" id=\"span_38\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"619152\" id=\"span_39\">8.   It is put forth that the concept of sustenance of\n\nindividual autonomy inheres in the right of privacy and also\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">\f                                                    12</span>\n\n\ncomes within the fundamental conception of liberty. To\n\nsustain the stand of privacy, reliance has been placed on the\n\ndecisions in <a href=\"/doc/619152/\" id=\"a_8\">Kharak Singh v. State of U.P. and others</a> 1 ,\n\n<a href=\"/doc/845196/\" id=\"a_9\">Gobind v. State of Madhya Pradesh and another</a> 2 and\n\nPeople’s Union for <a href=\"/doc/110957682/\" id=\"a_10\">Civil Liberties v. Union of India</a> and\n\nanother3.</span></span></span> Inspiration has also been drawn from the decision\n\nof the United States in Cruzan v. Director, Missouri\n\nDepartment of Health 4 . It is averred that due to the\n\nadvancement of modern medical technology pertaining to\n\nmedical science and respiration, a situation has been created\n\nwhere the dying process of the patient is unnecessarily\n\nprolonged causing distress and agony to the patient as well as\n\nto the near and dear ones and, consequently, the patient is in\n\na persistent vegetative state thereby allowing free intrusion. It\n\nis also contended that the petitioner-society is not claiming\n\nthat the right to die is a part of the right to life but asserting\n\nthe claim that the right to die with dignity is an inseparable\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">1</span>\n  (1964) 1 SCR 332 : AIR 1963 SC 1295\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">2</span>\n  (1975) 2 SCC 148\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">3</span>\n  (1997) 1 SCC 301\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_44\">4</span>\n  111 L Ed 2d 224 : 497 US 261 (1990) : 110 S.Ct. 2841 (1990)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">\f                               13</span>\n\n\nand inextricable facet of the right to live with dignity. The\n\nexecution of a living will or issuance of advance directive has\n\nbecome a necessity in today‘s time keeping in view the\n\nprolongation of treatment in spite of irreversible prognosis and\n\nowing to penal laws in the field that creates a dilemma in the\n\nminds of doctors to take aid of the modern techniques in a\n\ncase or not. A comparison has been made between the\n\nfundamental rights of an individual and the State interest\n\nfocusing on sanctity as well as quality of life. References have\n\nbeen made to the laws in various countries, namely, United\n\nKingdom, United States of America, Australia, Denmark,\n\nSingapore, Canada, etc. The autonomy of the patient has been\n\nlaid stress upon to highlight the right to die with dignity\n\nwithout pain and suffering which may otherwise be prolonged\n\nbecause of artificial continuance of life through methods that\n\nare really not of any assistance for cure or improvement of\n\nliving conditions.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">\f                               14</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_16\">\n\n\nC.

It is also\n\ncontended that the introduction of the right to die with dignity\n\nas a facet of the right under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_16\">Article 21</a> will create a right that\n\nthe said constitutional provision does not envisage and further\n\nit may have the potential effect to destroy the said basic right.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_18\">12. An application for intervention has been filed by the\n\n―Society for the Right to Die with Dignity‖ whose prayer for\n\nintervention has been allowed. The affidavit filed by the said\n\nsociety supports the concept of euthanasia because it is a\n\nrelief from irrecoverable suffering of which pain is a factor. It\n\nhas cited many an example from various texts to support\n\npassive euthanasia and suggested certain criteria to be\n\nfollowed.     It has also supported the idea of introduction of\n\nliving will and durable power of attorney documents and has\n\nfiled a sample of living will or advance health directive or\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\">\f                               18</span>\n\n\nadvance declaration provided by Luis Kutner. Emphasis has\n\nbeen laid on peaceful exit from life and the freedom of choice\n\nnot to live and particularly so under distressing conditions\n\nand ill-health which lead to an irrecoverable state. The\n\nmanagement of terminally ill patients has been put at the\n\ncentre stage.

The Court\n\nposed 16 questions. The relevant ones read thus:-</span>\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">      ―(1) Has <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_24\">Article 21</a> any positive content or is it merely\n           negative in its reach?\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">      (2) Has a person residing in India a right to die?\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">              x          x         x           x\n      (12) Is suicide against public policy?\n</blockquote>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\">6</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">    (1994) 3 SCC 394\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_56\">\f                                              20</span>\n\n\n       (13) Does commission of suicide damage the\n            monopolistic power of the State to take life?\n       (14) Is apprehension of ‗constitutional cannibalism‘\n            justified?\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">       (15) Recommendation of the Law Commission of India\n            and follow-up steps taken, if any.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">       (16) Global view.

Answering question No. (1), the Court, after referring to\n\nvarious authorities under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_25\">Article 21</a>, took note of the authority\n\nin <a href=\"/doc/1190717/\" id=\"a_26\">State of Himachal Pradesh and another v. Umed Ram\n\nSharma</a> and others7 wherein it has been observed that the\n\nright to life embraces not only physical existence but also the\n\nquality of life as understood in its richness and fullness within\n\nthe ambit of the Constitution. In the said case, the Court had\n\nheld that for residents of hilly areas, access to road was access\n\nto life itself and so, necessity of road communication in a\n\nreasonable              condition       was   treated   as   a   constitutional\n\nimperative. P. Rathinam perceived the elevated positive\n\ncontent in the said ruling.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"490515\" id=\"span_58\">Answering question No. (2), the\n\nCourt referred to the decision of the Bombay High Court in\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_59\">7</span>\n    (1986) 2 SCC 68 : <a href=\"/doc/490515/\" id=\"a_27\">AIR 1986 SC 847\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_60\">\f                                             21</span>\n\n\nMaruti Shripati Dubal v. State of Maharashtra</a> 8 that\n\nplaced reliance on R.C. Cooper v. Union of India9 wherein it\n\nhad been held that what is true of one fundamental right is\n\nalso true of another fundamental right and on the said\n\npremise, the Bombay High Court had opined that it cannot be\n\nseriously disputed that fundamental rights have their positive\n\nas well as negative aspects. Citing an example, it had stated\n\nthat freedom of speech and expression includes freedom not to\n\nspeak and similarly, the freedom of association and movement\n\nincludes freedom not to join any association or move anywhere\n\nand, accordingly, it stated that logically it must follow that the\n\nright to live would include the right not to live, i.e., right to die\n\nor to terminate one‘s life.</span>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">16. After so stating, this Court approved the view taken by\n\nthe Bombay High Court in Maruti Shripati Dubal and\n\nmeeting the criticism of that judgment from certain quarters,\n\nthe two-Judge Bench opined that the criticism was only\n\npartially correct because the negative aspect may not be\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_61\">8</span>\n    1987 Cri LJ 473 : (1986) 88 Bom LR 589\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_62\">9</span>\n    (1970) 2 SCC 298 : AIR 1970 SC 1318\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_63\">\f                                   22</span>\n\n\ninferable on the analogy of the rights conferred by different\n\nclauses of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_28\">Article 19</a> and one may refuse to live if his life,\n\naccording to the person concerned, is not worth living. One\n\nmay rightly think that having achieved all worldly pleasures or\n\nhappiness, he has something to achieve beyond this life. This\n\ndesire for communion with God may rightly lead even a\n\nhealthy mind to think that he would forego his right to live\n\nand would rather choose not to live. In any case, a person\n\ncannot be forced to enjoy the right to life to his detriment,\n\ndisadvantage or disliking.       Eventually, it concluded that the\n\nright to live of which <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_29\">Article 21</a> speaks of can be said to bring\n\nin its trail the right not to live a forced life.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">17. Answering all the questions, the Court declared <a href=\"/doc/1501595/\" id=\"a_30\">Section\n\n309</a> IPC ultra vires and held that it deserved to be effaced from\n\nthe statute book to humanize our penal laws.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">D.2 Gian    Kaur’s    case   –    The  question   of\n    unconstitutionality of <a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 306</a> of the Indian\n    Penal Code:\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">18. The dictum laid down by the two-Judge Bench in P.\n\nRathinam did not remain a precedent for long. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"217501\" id=\"span_64\">In <a href=\"/doc/217501/\" id=\"a_32\">Gian Kaur\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_65\">\f                                       23</span>\n\n\nv. State of Punjab10</a>, the Constitution Bench considered the\n\ncorrectness of the decision rendered in P. Rathinam. In the\n\nsaid case, the appellants were convicted by the trial Court\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 306</a> IPC and the conviction was assailed on the\n\nground that <a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 306</a> IPC is unconstitutional and to\n\nsustain the said argument, reliance was placed on the\n\nauthority in P. Rathinam wherein <a href=\"/doc/1501595/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 309</a> IPC was held\n\nto be unconstitutional being violative of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_36\">Article 21</a> of the\n\nConstitution. It was urged that once <a href=\"/doc/1501595/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 309</a> IPC had been\n\nheld         to    be   unconstitutional,   any   person   abetting   the\n\ncommission of suicide by another is merely assisting in the\n\nenforcement of the fundamental right under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_38\">Article 21</a> and,\n\ntherefore, <a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 306</a> IPC penalizing abetment of suicide is\n\nequally violative of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_40\">Article 21.</a> The two-Judge Bench before\n\nwhich these arguments were advanced in appeal referred the\n\nmatter to a Constitution Bench for deciding the same. In the\n\ncourse of arguments, one of the amicus curiae, Mr. F.S.\n\nNariman, learned senior counsel, had submitted that the\n\ndebate on euthanasia is not relevant for deciding the question\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_66\">10</span>\n     (1996) 2 SCC 648\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_67\">\f                               24</span>\n\n\nof constitutional validity of <a href=\"/doc/1501595/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 309</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_42\">Article 21</a> cannot\n\nbe construed to include within it the so-called ―right to die‖\n\nsince <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_43\">Article 21</a> guarantees protection of life and liberty and\n\nnot its extinction. The Constitution Bench, after noting the\n\nsubmissions, stated:-</span>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">     ―17. … We, therefore, proceed now to consider the\n     question of constitutional validity with reference to\n     <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_44\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_45\">21</a> of the Constitution. Any further\n     reference to the global debate on the desirability of\n     retaining a penal provision to punish attempted\n     suicide is unnecessary for the purpose of this\n     decision. Undue emphasis on that aspect and\n     particularly the reference to euthanasia cases tends\n     to befog the real issue of the constitutionality of the\n     provision and the crux of the matter which is\n     determinative of the issue.‖\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"217501\" id=\"span_68\">19. Thereafter, the Constitution Bench in <a href=\"/doc/217501/\" id=\"a_46\">Gian Kaur</a> (supra)\n\nscrutinized the reasons given in P. Rathinam and opined that\n\nthe Court in the said case took the view that if a person has a\n\nright to live, he also has a right not to live.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"542988\" id=\"span_69\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"217501\" id=\"span_70\">The Court in <a href=\"/doc/217501/\" id=\"a_47\">Gian\n\nKaur</a> (supra) observed that the Court in <a href=\"/doc/542988/\" id=\"a_48\">P. Rathinam</a> (supra),\n\nwhile taking such a view, relied on the decisions which relate\n\nto other fundamental rights dealing with different situations\n\nand those decisions merely hold that the right to do an act\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_71\">\f                                 25</span>\n\n\nalso includes the right not to do an act in that manner. The\n\nlarger Bench further observed that in all those decisions, it\n\nwas the negative aspect of the right that was involved for\n\nwhich no positive or overt act was to be done.                 The\n\nConstitution Bench categorically stated that this difference\n\nhas to be borne in mind while making the comparison for the\n\napplication of this principle.</span></span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">20. Delving into the facet of committing suicide, the larger\n\nBench observed that when a man commits suicide, he has to\n\nundertake certain positive overt acts and the genesis of those\n\nacts cannot be traced to or be included within the protection of\n\nthe ‗right to life‘ under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_49\">Article 21.</a> It also held that the\n\nsignificant aspect of ‗sanctity of life‘ should not be overlooked.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_26\">The Court further opined that by no stretch of imagination,\n\nextinction of life can be read to be included in protection of life\n\nbecause <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_50\">Article 21</a>, in its ambit and sweep, cannot include\n\nwithin it the right to die as a part of fundamental right\n\nguaranteed therein. The Constitution Bench ruled:-\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_38\">     ―‗Right to life‘ is a natural right embodied in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_51\">Article\n     21</a> but suicide is an unnatural termination or\n     extinction of life and, therefore, incompatible and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_72\">\f                                 26</span>\n\n\n     inconsistent with the concept of ―right to life‖. With\n     respect and in all humility, we find no similarity in\n     the nature of the other rights, such as the right to\n     ―freedom of speech‖ etc. to provide a comparable\n     basis to hold that the ―right to life‖ also includes the\n     ―right to die‖. With respect, the comparison is\n     inapposite, for the reason indicated in the context of\n     <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_52\">Article 21.</a> The decisions relating to other\n     fundamental rights wherein the absence of\n     compulsion to exercise a right was held to be\n     included within the exercise of that right, are not\n     available to support the view taken in P. Rathinam\n     qua Article 21.‖\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_39\">21. Adverting to the concept of euthanasia, the Court\n\nobserved that protagonism of euthanasia on the view that\n\nexistence in persistent vegetative state (PVS) is not a benefit to\n\nthe patient of terminal illness being unrelated to the principle\n\nof ―sanctity of life‖ or the ―right to live with dignity‖ is of no\n\nassistance to determine the scope of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_53\">Article 21</a> for deciding\n\nwhether the guarantee of ―right to life‖ therein includes the\n\n―right to die‖. The ―right to life‖ including the right to live with\n\nhuman dignity would mean the existence of such a right up to\n\nthe end of natural life. The Constitution Bench further\n\nexplained that the said conception also includes the right to a\n\ndignified life up to the point of death including a dignified\n\nprocedure of death or, in other words, it may include the right\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_73\">\f                               27</span>\n\n\nof a dying man to also die with dignity when his life is ebbing\n\nout. It has been clarified that the right to die with dignity at\n\nthe end of life is not to be confused or equated with the ―right\n\nto die‖ an unnatural death curtailing the natural span of life.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_27\">Thereafter, the Court proceeded to state:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_40\">     ―25. A question may arise, in the context of a dying\n     man who is terminally ill or in a persistent\n     vegetative state that he may be permitted to\n     terminate it by a premature extinction of his life in\n     those circumstances. This category of cases may fall\n     within the ambit of the ―right to die‖ with dignity as\n     a part of right to live with dignity, when death due\n     to termination of natural life is certain and\n     imminent and the process of natural death has\n     commenced. These are not cases of extinguishing\n     life but only of accelerating conclusion of the\n     process of natural death which has already\n     commenced. The debate even in such cases to\n     permit physician-assisted termination of life is\n     inconclusive. It is sufficient to reiterate that the\n     argument to support the view of permitting\n     termination of life in such cases to reduce the\n     period of suffering during the process of certain\n     natural death is not available to interpret <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_54\">Article 21</a>\n     to include therein the right to curtail the natural\n     span of life.‖\n                                      [Emphasis supplied]\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_41\">22.

It then examined the question\n\nof validity of <a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_56\">Section 306</a> IPC. It accepted the submission that\n\n<a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_57\">Section 306</a> is constitutional. While adverting to the decision in\n\nAiredale N.H.S. Trust v. Bland11, the Court at the outset made\n\nit clear that it was not called upon to deal with the issue of\n\nphysician-assisted suicide or euthanasia cases. The decision in\n\nAiredale‘s case (supra), was relating to the withdrawal of\n\nartificial measures for continuance of life by a physician. In the\n\ncontext of existence in the persistent vegetative state of no\n\nbenefit to the patient, the principle of sanctity of life, which is\n\nthe concern of the State, was stated to be not an absolute one.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_44\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"217501\" id=\"span_75\">To bring home the distinction between active and passive\n\neuthanasia, an illustration was noted in the context of\n\nadministering lethal drug actively to bring the patient&#x27;s life to an\n\nend. The significant dictum in that decision has been extracted\n\nin <a href=\"/doc/217501/\" id=\"a_58\">Gian Kaur</a> (supra) wherein it is observed that it is not lawful\n\nfor a doctor to administer a drug to his patient to bring about\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_76\">11</span>\n     (1993) 2 WLR 316: (1993) 1 All ER 821, HL\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_77\">\f                                     29</span>\n\n\nhis        death   even   though   that   course   is   promoted   by   a\n\nhumanitarian desire to end his suffering and however great that\n\nsuffering may be. Further, to act so is to cross the rubicon\n\nwhich runs between the care of the living patient on one hand\n\nand euthanasia - actively causing his death to avoid or to end\n\nhis suffering on the other hand. It has been noticed in Airedale\n\nthat euthanasia is not lawful at common law. In the light of the\n\ndemand of responsible members of the society who believe that\n\neuthanasia should be made lawful, it has been observed in that\n\ndecision that the same can be achieved by legislation.</span> The\n\nConstitution Bench has merely noted this aspect in paragraph\n\n41 with reference to the dictum in Airedale case.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\">24.

The constitutional validity\n           of the State statute that banned physician-assisted\n           suicide by mentally competent, terminally ill adults\n           was in question. The District Court held\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_78\">12</span>\n     49 F 3d 586\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_79\">\f                               30</span>\n\n\n     unconstitutional the provision punishing for\n     promoting a suicide attempt.

This caution even in cases of physician-\n     assisted suicide is sufficient to indicate that\n     assisted suicides outside that category have no\n     rational basis to claim exclusion of the fundamental\n     principles of sanctity of life. The reasons assigned\n     for attacking a provision which penalises attempted\n     suicide are not available to the abettor of suicide or\n     attempted suicide. Abetment of suicide or attempted\n     suicide is a distinct offence which is found enacted\n     even in the law of the countries where attempted\n     suicide is not made punishable. <a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_59\">Section 306</a> IPC\n     enacts a distinct offence which can survive\n     independent of <a href=\"/doc/1501595/\" id=\"a_60\">Section 309</a> in the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_61\">IPC</a>.

It arose for consideration almost\n\nafter a span of eleven years in <a href=\"/doc/235821/\" id=\"a_66\">Aruna Shanbaug</a> (supra). A\n\nwrit petition was filed by the next friend of the petitioner\n\npleading,   inter   alia,   that   the   petitioner   was   suffering\n\nimmensely because of an incident that took place thirty six\n\nyears back on 27.11.1973 and was in a Persistent Vegetative\n\nState (PVS) and in no state of awareness and her brain was\n\nvirtually dead. The prayer of the next friend was that the\n\nrespondent be directed to stop feeding the petitioner and to\n\nallow her to die peacefully. The Court noticed that there was\n\nsome variance in the allegation made in the writ petition and\n\nthe counter affidavit filed by the Professor and Head of the\n\nhospital where the petitioner was availing treatment. The\n\nCourt appointed a team of three very distinguished doctors to\n\nexamine the petitioner thoroughly and to submit a report\n\nabout her physical and mental condition. The team submitted\n\na joint report. The Court asked the team of doctors to submit\n\na supplementary report by which the meaning of the technical\n\nterms in the first report could be explained.         Various other\n\naspects were also made clear. It is also worth noting that the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_84\">\f                                                   32</span>\n\n\nKEM           Hospital        where          the   petitioner   was   admitted   was\n\nappointed as the next friend by the Court because of its\n\nservices rendered to the petitioner and the emotional bonding\n\nand attachment with the petitioner.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_30\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_31\">26. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"588316\" id=\"span_85\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"235821\" id=\"span_86\">In <a href=\"/doc/235821/\" id=\"a_67\">Aruna Shanbaug</a> (supra), after referring to the\n\nauthority in <a href=\"/doc/588316/\" id=\"a_68\">Vikram Deo Singh Tomar v. State of Bihar13</a>,\n\nthis Court reproduced paragraphs 24 and 25 from Gian\n\nKaur‘s case and opined that the said paragraphs simply mean\n\nthat the view taken in Rathinam’s case to the effect that the\n\n‗right to life‘ includes the ‗right to die‘ is not correct and para\n\n25 specifically mentions that the debate even in such cases to\n\npermit physician-assisted termination of life is inconclusive.\n\nThe Court further observed that it was held in Gian Kaur that\n\nthere is no ‗right to die‘ under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_69\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution\n\nand the right to life includes the right to live with human\n\ndignity but in the case of a dying person who is terminally ill\n\nor in permanent vegetative state, he may be allowed a\n\npremature extinction of his life and it would not amount to a\n\ncrime. Thereafter, the Court took note of the submissions of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_87\">13</span>\n     1988 Supp. SCC 734 : AIR 1988 SC 1782\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_88\">\f                                  33</span>\n\n\nthe learned amicus curiae to the effect that the decision to\n\nwithdraw life support is taken in the best interests of the\n\npatient by a body of medical persons. The Court observed that\n\nit is not the function of the Court to evaluate the situation and\n\nform an opinion on its own. The Court further noted that in\n\nEngland, the parens patriae jurisdiction over adult mentally\n\nincompetent persons was abolished by statute and the Court\n\nhas no power now to give its consent and in such a situation,\n\nthe Court only gives a declaration that the proposed omission\n\nby doctors is not unlawful.</span></span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_32\">27. After so stating, the Court addressed the legal issues,\n\nnamely,   active    and   passive      euthanasia.     It   noted   the\n\nlegislations prevalent in Netherlands, Switzerland, Belgium,\n\nU.K., Spain, Austria, Italy, Germany, France and United States\n\nof America. It also noted that active euthanasia is illegal in all\n\nStates in USA, but physician-assisted death is legal in the\n\nStates of Oregon, Washington and Montana. The Court also\n\nreferred to the legal position in Canada. Dealing with passive\n\neuthanasia,   the     two-Judge     Bench     opined    that   passive\n\neuthanasia    is    usually   defined    as   withdrawing      medical\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_89\">\f                                34</span>\n\n\ntreatment with a deliberate intention of causing the patient‘s\n\ndeath.    An example was cited by stating that if a patient\n\nrequires kidney dialysis to survive, not giving dialysis although\n\nthe machine is available is passive euthanasia and similarly,\n\nwithdrawing the machine where a patient is in coma or on\n\nheart-lung machine support will ordinarily result in passive\n\neuthanasia. The Court also put non-administration of life\n\nsaving medicines like antibiotics in certain situations on the\n\nsame platform of passive euthanasia.         Denying food to a\n\nperson in coma or PVS has also been treated to come within\n\nthe ambit of passive euthanasia. The Court copiously referred\n\nto the decision in Airedale. In Airedale case, as has been\n\nnoted    in   Aruna   Shanbaug,      Lord   Goff   observed   that\n\ndiscontinuance of artificial feeding in such cases is not\n\nequivalent to cutting a mountaineer‘s rope or severing the air\n\npipe of a deep sea diver.     The real question has to be not\n\nwhether the doctor should take a course in which he will\n\nactively kill his patient but whether he should continue to\n\nprovide his patient with medical treatment or care which, if\n\ncontinued, will prolong his life.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_90\">\f                               35</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_33\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_34\">28. Lord Browne–Wilkinson was of the view that removing\n\nthe nasogastric tube in the case of Anthony Bland cannot be\n\nregarded as a positive act causing death. The tube by itself,\n\nwithout the food being supplied through it, does nothing. Its\n\nnon-removal by itself does not cause death since by itself, it\n\ndoes not sustain life. The learned Judge observed that removal\n\nof the tube would not constitute the actus reus of murder\n\nsince such an act by itself would not cause death.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_35\">29. Lord Mustill observed:-\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_36\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_48\">     ―Threaded through the technical arguments\n     addressed to the House were the strands of a much\n     wider position, that it is in the best interests of the\n     community at large that Anthony Bland’s life should\n     now end. The doctors have done all they can.\n     Nothing will be gained by going on and much will be\n     lost. The distress of the family will get steadily\n     worse. The strain on the devotion of a medical staff\n     charged with the care of a patient whose condition\n     will never improve, who may live for years and who\n     does not even recognise that he is being cared for,\n     will continue to mount. The large resources of skill,\n     labour and money now being devoted to Anthony\n     Bland might in the opinion of many be more\n     fruitfully employed in improving the condition of\n     other patients, who if treated may have useful,\n     healthy and enjoyable lives for years to come.‖\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_91\">\f                                                     36</span>\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_37\">30. The two-Judge Bench further observed that the decision\n\nin Airedale by the House of Lords has been followed in a\n\nnumber of cases in U.K. and the law is now fairly well settled\n\nthat in the case of incompetent patients, if the doctors act on\n\nthe basis of notified medical opinion and withdraw the\n\nartificial life support system in the patient‘s best interest, the\n\nsaid act cannot be regarded as a crime. The learned Judges\n\nposed the question as to who is to decide what is that patient‘s\n\nbest interest where he is in a PVS and, in that regard, opined\n\nthat it is ultimately for the Court to decide, as parens patriae,\n\nas to what is in the best interest of the patient, though the\n\nwishes of close relatives and next friend and the opinion of\n\nmedical practitioners should be given due weight in coming to\n\nits decision. For the said purpose, reference was made to the\n\nopinion of Balcombe J. in Re J (A Minor) (Wardship: Medical\n\nTreatment) 14 whereby it has been stated that the Court as\n\nrepresentative of the Sovereign and as parens patriae will\n\nadopt the same standard which a reasonable and responsible\n\nparent would do.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_38\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_92\">14</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_39\">     [1991] 2 WLR 140: [1990] 3 All ER 930: [1991] Fam 33\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_93\">\f                                                    37</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_40\">31.

Quill16 which addressed the issue\n\nwhether there was a federal constitutional road to assisted\n\nsuicide.            Analysing the said decisions and others, the Court\n\nobserved that the informed consent doctrine has become\n\nfirmly entrenched in American Tort Law and, as a logical\n\ncorollary, lays foundation for the doctrine that the patient who\n\ngenerally possesses the right to consent has the right to refuse\n\ntreatment.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_41\">32. In the ultimate analysis, the Court opined that the\n\nAiredale case is more apposite to be followed. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"217501\" id=\"span_94\">Thereafter, the\n\nCourt adverted to the law in India and ruled that in <a href=\"/doc/217501/\" id=\"a_70\">Gian\n\nKaur</a> case, this Court had approved the decision of the House\n\nof Lords in Airedale and observed that euthanasia could be\n\nmade lawful only by legislation.

It may be noted that in <a href=\"/doc/217501/\" id=\"a_71\">Gian Kaur</a> case\n           although the Supreme Court has quoted with\n           approval the view of the House of Lords in Airedale\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_96\">15</span>\n     138 L Ed 2d 772 : 521 US 702 (1997)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_97\">16</span>\n     138 L Ed 2d 834 : 521 US 793 (1997)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_98\">\f                               38</span>\n\n\n     case, it has not clarified who can decide whether life\n     support should be discontinued in the case of an\n     incompetent person e.g. a person in coma or PVS.</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_42\">     This vexed question has been arising often in India\n     because there are a large number of cases where\n     persons go into coma (due to an accident or some\n     other reason) or for some other reason are unable to\n     give consent, and then the question arises as to who\n     should give consent for withdrawal of life support.\n     This is an extremely important question in India\n     because of the unfortunate low level of ethical\n     standards to which our society has descended, its\n     raw and widespread commercialisation, and the\n     rampant corruption, and hence, the Court has to be\n     very cautious that unscrupulous persons who wish\n     to inherit the property of someone may not get him\n     eliminated by some crooked method.‖\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_43\">33. After so stating, the two-Judge Bench dwelled upon the\n\nconcept of brain dead and various other aspects which\n\nincluded withdrawal of life support of a patient in PVS and, in\n\nthat context, ruled thus:-\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_44\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_50\">     ―125. In our opinion, if we leave it solely to the\n     patient‘s relatives or to the doctors or next friend to\n     decide whether to withdraw the life support of an\n     incompetent person there is always a risk in our\n     country that this may be misused by some\n     unscrupulous persons who wish to inherit or\n     otherwise grab the property of the patient.\n     Considering the low ethical levels prevailing in our\n     society today and the rampant commercialisation\n     and corruption, we cannot rule out the possibility\n     that unscrupulous persons with the help of some\n     unscrupulous doctors may fabricate material to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_99\">\f                                    39</span>\n\n\n           show that it is a terminal case with no chance of\n           recovery. There are doctors and doctors. While\n           many doctors are upright, there are others who can\n           do anything for money (see George Bernard Shaw‘s\n           play The Doctor’s Dilemma). The commercialisation\n           of our society has crossed all limits. Hence we have\n           to guard against the potential of misuse (see Robin\n           Cook‘s novel Coma). In our opinion, while giving\n           great weight to the wishes of the parents, spouse, or\n           other close relatives or next friend of the\n           incompetent patient and also giving due weight to\n           the opinion of the attending doctors, we cannot\n           leave it entirely to their discretion whether to\n           discontinue the life support or not. We agree with\n           the decision of Lord Keith in Airedale case5 that the\n           approval of the High Court should be taken in this\n           connection. This is in the interest of the protection\n           of the patient, protection of the doctors, relatives\n           and next friend, and for reassurance of the patient‘s\n           family as well as the public.

Dealing with the\n\nprocedure to be adopted by the High Court when such\n\napplication is filed, the Court ruled that when such an\n\napplication is filed, the Chief Justice of the High Court should\n\nforthwith constitute a Bench of at least two Judges who\n\nshould decide to grant approval or not and before doing so, the\n\nBench should seek the opinion of a Committee of three\n\nreputed doctors to be nominated by the Bench after consulting\n\nsuch medical authorities/medical practitioners as it may deem\n\nfit. Amongst the three doctors, as directed, one should be a\n\nNeurologist, one should be a Psychiatrist and the third a\n\nPhysician.

Our analysis of Gian Kaur:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_56\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"235821\" id=\"span_121\">40. It is the first and foremost duty to understand what has\n\nbeen stated by the Constitution Bench in Gian Kaur‘s case. It\n\nhas referred to the decision in Airedale (supra) that has been\n\nrecapitulated in <a href=\"/doc/235821/\" id=\"a_89\">Aruna Shanbaug</a> case which was a case\n\nrelating to withdrawal of artificial measures of continuance of\n\nlife by the physician. It is relevant to mention here that the\n\nConstitution Bench in Gian Kaur categorically noted that it\n\nwas not necessary to deal with physician–assisted suicide or\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_122\">\f                                46</span>\n\n\neuthanasia cases though a brief reference to the decisions\n\ncited by the Bar was required to be made. The Constitution\n\nBench noted that Airedale held that in the context of\n\nexistence in the persistent vegetative state of no benefit to the\n\npatient, the principle of sanctity of life, which is the concern of\n\nthe State, was not an absolute one. The larger bench further\n\nnoticed that in Airedale, it had been stated that in such cases\n\nalso, the existing crucial distinction between cases in which a\n\nphysician decides not to provide or to continue to provide, for\n\nhis patient, treatment or care which could or might prolong\n\nhis life, and those in which he decides, for example, by\n\nadministering a lethal drug actively to bring his patient‘s life to\n\nan end, was indicated.</span> Thereafter, while again referring to\n\nAiredale case, the larger bench observed that it was a case\n\nrelating to withdrawal of artificial measures for continuance of\n\nlife by the physician. After so stating, the Court reproduced\n\nthe following passage from the opinion of Lord Goff of\n\nChieveley:-\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_57\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_59\">      ―...

Cox, (unreported), 18\n     September (1992).

The desirability of bringing about a change was\n     considered to be the function of the legislature by\n     enacting a suitable law providing therein adequate\n     safeguards to prevent any possible abuse.‖\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_60\">42. At this stage, it is necessary to clear the maze whether\n\nthe Constitution Bench in Gian Kaur had accepted what has\n\nbeen held in Airedale. On a careful and anxious reading of\n\nGian Kaur, it is noticeable that there has been narration,\n\nreference and notice of the view taken in Airedale case. It is\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_124\">\f                               48</span>\n\n\nalso worth noting that the Court was concerned with the\n\nconstitutional validity of <a href=\"/doc/1501595/\" id=\"a_90\">Section 309</a> IPC that deals with\n\nattempt to commit suicide and <a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_91\">Section 306</a> IPC that provides\n\nfor abetment to commit suicide. As noted earlier, the\n\nConstitution Bench, while distinguishing the case of a dying\n\nman who is terminally ill or in a persistent vegetative state and\n\nhis termination or premature extinction of life, observed that\n\nthe said category of cases may fall within the ambit of right to\n\ndie with dignity as a part of right to life with dignity when\n\ndeath due to termination of natural life is inevitable and\n\nimminent and the process of natural death has commenced.\n\nThe Constitution Bench further opined that the said cases do\n\nnot amount to extinguishing the life but only amount to\n\naccelerating the process of natural death which has already\n\ncommenced and, thereafter, the Constitution Bench stated\n\nthat the debate with regard to physician assisted suicide\n\nremains inconclusive. The larger Bench has reiterated that the\n\ncases pertaining to premature extinction of life during the\n\nprocess of certain natural death of patients who are terminally\n\nill or in persistent vegetative state were of assistance to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_125\">\f                                49</span>\n\n\ninterpret <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_92\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution to include therein the\n\nright to curtail the natural span of life.         On a seemly\n\nunderstanding of the judgment in Gian Kaur, we do not find\n\nthat it has decried euthanasia as a concept. On the contrary,\n\nit gives an indication that in such situations, it is the\n\nacceleration of the process of dying which may constitute a\n\npart of right to life with dignity so that the period of suffering\n\nis reduced. We are absolutely conscious that a judgment is not\n\nto be construed as a statute but our effort is to understand\n\nwhat has been really expressed in Gian Kaur. Be it clarified,\n\nit is understood and appreciated that there is a distinction\n\nbetween a positive or overt act to put an end to life by the\n\nperson living his life and termination of life so that an\n\nindividual does not remain in a vegetative state or, for that\n\nmatter, when the death is certain because of terminal illness\n\nand he remains alive with the artificially assisted medical\n\nsystem. In Gian Kaur, while dealing with the attempt to\n\ncommit suicide, the Court clearly held that when a man\n\ncommits suicide, he has to undertake certain positive overt\n\nacts and the genesis of those acts cannot be tested to or be\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_126\">\f                               50</span>\n\n\nincluded within the protection of the expression ―right to life‖\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_93\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. It was also observed that\n\na dignified procedure of death may include the right of a dying\n\nman to also die with dignity when the life is ebbing out. This\n\nis how the pronouncement in Gian               Kaur has to be\n\nunderstood. It is also not the ratio of the authority in Gian\n\nKaur that euthanasia has to be introduced only by a\n\nlegislation.   What has been stated in paragraph 41 of Gian\n\nKaur is what has been understood to have been held in\n\nAiredale‘s case. The Court has neither expressed any\n\nindependent opinion nor has it approved the said part or the\n\nratio as stated in Airedale. There has been only a reference to\n\nAiredale‘s case and the view expressed therein as regards\n\nlegislation. Therefore, the perception in Aruna Shanbaug that\n\nthe   Constitution   Bench   has    approved    the   decision   in\n\nAiredale is not correct. It is also quite clear that Gian Kaur\n\ndoes not lay down that passive euthanasia can only be\n\nthought of or given effect to by legislation. Appositely\n\nunderstood, it opens an expansive sphere of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_94\">Article 21</a> of the\n\nConstitution. Therefore, it can be held without any hesitation\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_127\">\f                                51</span>\n\n\nthat Gian Kaur has neither given any definite opinion with\n\nregard to euthanasia nor has it stated that the same can be\n\nconceived of only by a legislation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_61\">\nF.   Our analysis of Aruna Shanbaug qua legislation:\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_62\">43. Having said this, we shall focus in detail what has been\n\nstated in Aruna Shanbaug.            In paragraph 101 which has\n\nbeen reproduced hereinbefore, the two-Judge Bench noted\n\nthat Gian Kaur has approved the decision of the House of\n\nLords in Airedale and observed that euthanasia could be\n\nmade lawful only by legislation. This perception, according to\n\nus, is not correct. As already stated, Gian Kaur does not lay\n\ndown that passive euthanasia could be made lawful only by\n\nlegislation. In paragraph 41 of the said judgment, the\n\nConstitution Bench was only adverting to what has been\n\nstated by Lord Goff of Chieveley in Airedale‘s case. However,\n\nthis expression of view of Aruna Shanbaug which has not\n\nbeen accepted by the referral Bench makes no difference to\n\nour present analysis.    We unequivocally express the opinion\n\nthat Gian Kaur is not a binding precedent for the purpose of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_128\">\f                                 52</span>\n\n\nlaying down the principle that passive euthanasia can be\n\nmade lawful ―only by legislation.‖\n\nG.   The Distinction          between      Active    and      Passive\n     Euthanasia:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_63\">44. As a first step, it is imperative to understand the concept\n\nof euthanasia before we enter into the arena of analysis of the\n\nexpanded right of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_95\">Article 21</a> in            Gian     Kaur and the\n\nunderstanding of the same. Euthanasia is basically an\n\nintentional premature termination of another person‘s life\n\neither   by   direct   intervention   (active   euthanasia)    or   by\n\nwithholding life-prolonging measures and resources (passive\n\neuthanasia) either at the express or implied request of that\n\nperson (voluntary euthanasia) or in the absence of such\n\napproval/consent        (non-voluntary      euthanasia).       Aruna\n\nShanbaug has discussed about two categories of euthanasia -\n\nactive and passive. While dealing with active euthanasia, also\n\nknown as ―positive euthanasia‖ or ―aggressive euthanasia‖, it\n\nhas been stated that the said type of euthanasia entails a\n\npositive act or affirmative action or act of commission entailing\n\nthe use of lethal substances or forces to cause the intentional\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_129\">\f                                53</span>\n\n\ndeath of a person by direct intervention, e.g., a lethal injection\n\ngiven to a person with terminal cancer who is in terrible\n\nagony. Passive euthanasia, on the other hand, also called\n\n―negative euthanasia‖ or ―non-aggressive euthanasia‖, entails\n\nwithdrawing of life support measures or withholding of\n\nmedical treatment for continuance of life, e.g., withholding of\n\nantibiotics in case of a patient where death is likely to occur as\n\na result of not giving the said antibiotics or removal of the\n\nheart lung machine from a patient in coma. The two-Judge\n\nBench has also observed that the legal position across the\n\nworld seems to be that while active euthanasia is illegal unless\n\nthere is a legislation permitting it, passive euthanasia is legal\n\neven without legislation, provided certain conditions and\n\nsafeguards are maintained. The Court has drawn further\n\ndistinction between voluntary euthanasia and non-voluntary\n\neuthanasia in the sense that voluntary euthanasia is where\n\nthe consent is taken from the patient and non-voluntary\n\neuthanasia is where the consent is unavailable, for instances\n\nwhen the patient is in coma or is otherwise unable to give\n\nconsent.   Describing further about active euthanasia, the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_130\">\f                               54</span>\n\n\nDivision Bench has observed that the said type of euthanasia\n\ninvolves taking specific steps to cause the patient‘s death such\n\nas injecting the patient with some lethal substance, i.e.,\n\nsodium pentothal which causes, in a person, a state of deep\n\nsleep in a few seconds and the person instantly dies in that\n\nstate. That apart, the Court has drawn a distinction between\n\neuthanasia and physician assisted dying and noted that the\n\ndifference lies in the fact as to who administers the lethal\n\nmedication.   It has been observed that in euthanasia, a\n\nphysician or third party administers it while in physician\n\nassisted suicide, it is the patient who does it though on the\n\nadvice of the doctor.     Elaborating further, the two-Judge\n\nBench has opined that the predominant difference between\n\n―active‖ and ―passive‖ euthanasia is that in the former, a\n\nspecific act is done to end the patient‘s life while the latter\n\ncovers a situation where something is not done which is\n\nnecessary in preserving the patient‘s life.     The main idea\n\nbehind the distinction, as observed by the Bench, is that in\n\npassive euthanasia, the doctors are not actively killing the\n\npatient, they are merely not saving him and only accelerating\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_131\">\f                                55</span>\n\n\nthe conclusion of the process of natural death which has\n\nalready commenced.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_64\">45. The two-Judge Bench, thereafter, elaborated on passive\n\neuthanasia and gave more examples of cases within the ambit\n\nof passive euthanasia. The learned Judges further categorized\n\npassive euthanasia into voluntary passive euthanasia and\n\nnon-voluntary     passive   euthanasia.   The    learned   Judges\n\ndescribed voluntary passive euthanasia as a situation where a\n\nperson who is capable of deciding for himself decides that he\n\nwould prefer to die because of various reasons whereas non-\n\nvoluntary passive euthanasia has been described to mean that\n\na person is not in a position to decide for himself, e.g., if he is\n\nin coma or PVS.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_65\">46. While scrutinizing the distinction between active and\n\npassive euthanasia, the paramount aspect is ―foreseeing the\n\nhastening of death‖. The said view has been propagated in\n\nseveral decisions all over the world. The Supreme Court of\n\nCanada, in the case of Rodriguez v. British Columbia\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_132\">\f                                                        56</span>\n\n\n(Attorney General)19, drew the distinction between these two\n\nforms of euthanasia on the basis of intention. Echoing a\n\nsimilar view, the Supreme Court of the United States affirmed\n\nthe said distinction on the basis of ―intention‖ in the case of\n\nVacco (supra) wherein Chief Justice Rehnquist observed that\n\nthe said distinction coheres with the fundamental legal\n\nprinciples of causation and intention. In case when the death\n\nof a patient occurs due to removal of life-supporting measures,\n\nthe patient dies due to an underlying fatal disease without any\n\nintervening act on the part of the doctor or medical\n\npractitioner, whereas in the cases coming within the purview\n\nof active euthanasia, for example, when the patient ingests\n\nlethal medication, he is killed by that medication.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_66\">47. This distinction on the basis of ―intention‖ further finds\n\nsupport in the explanation provided in the case In the matter\n\nof Claire C. Conroy20 wherein the Court made an observation\n\nthat people who refuse life-sustaining medical treatment may\n\nnot harbour a specific intent to die, rather they may fervently\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_133\">19</span>\n     85 C.C.C. (3d) 15 : (1993) 3 S.C.R. 519\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_134\">20</span>\n     98 N.J. 321 (1985) : (1985) 486 A.2d 1209 (N.J.)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_135\">\f                                57</span>\n\n\nwish to live but do so free of unwanted medical technology,\n\nsurgery or drugs and without protracted suffering.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_67\">48. Another distinction on the basis of ―action and non-\n\naction‖ was advanced in the Airedale case. Drawing a crucial\n\ndistinction between the two forms of euthanasia, Lord Goff\n\nobserved that passive euthanasia includes cases in which a\n\ndoctor decides not to provide, or to continue to provide, for his\n\npatient, treatment or care which could prolong his life and\n\nactive euthanasia involves actively ending a patient‘s life, for\n\nexample,   by   administering   a    lethal   drug.   As   per   the\n\nobservations made by Lord Goff, the former can be considered\n\nlawful either because the doctor intends to give effect to his\n\npatient‘s wishes by withholding the treatment or care, or even\n\nin certain circumstances in which the patient is incapacitated\n\nfrom giving his consent. However, active euthanasia, even\n\nvoluntary, is impermissible despite being prompted by the\n\nhumanitarian desire to end the suffering of the patient.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_68\">49. It is perhaps due to the distinction evolved between these\n\ntwo forms of euthanasia, which has gained moral and legal\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_136\">\f                                    58</span>\n\n\nsanctity all over, that most of the countries today have\n\nlegalized passive euthanasia either by way of legislations or\n\nthrough judicial interpretation but there remains uncertainty\n\nwhether active euthanasia should be granted legal status.\n\nH.   Euthanasia : International Position:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_69\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_62\">H.1 U.K. Decisions:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_63\">H.1.1 Airedale Case:\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_70\">50. In the obtaining situation, we shall now advert to the\n\nopinions stated in Airedale case.               In the said case, one\n\nAnthony Bland, a supporter of Liverpool Football Club, who\n\nhad gone to Hillsborough Ground, suffered severe injuries as a\n\nresult   of   which   supply   to        his   brain   was   interrupted.\n\nEventually, he suffered an irreversible damage to the brain as\n\na consequence of which he got into a condition of persistent\n\nvegetative state (PVS).    He became incapable of voluntary\n\nmovement and could feel no pain. He was not in a position to\n\nfeel or communicate. To keep him alive, artificial means were\n\ntaken recourse to. In such a state of affairs, the treating\n\ndoctors and the parents of Bland felt that no fruitful purpose\n\nwould be served by continuing the medical aid. As there were\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_137\">\f                               59</span>\n\n\ndoubts with regard to stoppage of medical care which may\n\nincur a criminal liability, a declaration from the British High\n\nCourt was sought to resolve the doubts. The Family Division\n\nof the High Court granted the declaration which was affirmed\n\nby the Court of Appeal. The matter travelled to the House of\n\nLords.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_71\">51. Lord Keith of Kinkel opined that regard should be had to\n\nthe whole artificial regime which kept Anthony Bland alive and\n\nit was incorrect to direct attention exclusively to the fact that\n\nnourishment     was   being   provided.    In   his   view,   the\n\nadministration of nourishment by the means adopted involved\n\nthe application of a medical technique.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_72\">52. Lord Keith observed that in general, it would not be\n\nlawful for a medical practitioner who assumed responsibility\n\nfor the care of an unconscious patient simply to give up\n\ntreatment in circumstances where continuance of it would\n\nconfer some benefit on the patient. On the other hand, a\n\nmedical practitioner is under no duty to continue to treat such\n\na patient where a large body of informed and responsible\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_138\">\f                                60</span>\n\n\nmedical opinion is to the effect that no benefit at all would be\n\nconferred by continuance of treatment. Existence in a\n\nvegetative state with no prospect of recovery is, by that\n\nopinion, regarded as not being a benefit, and that, if not\n\nunarguably correct, at least forms a proper basis for the\n\ndecision to discontinue treatment and care.        He was of the\n\nfurther opinion that since existence in PVS is not a benefit to\n\nthe patient, the principle of sanctity of life is no longer an\n\nabsolute one. It does not compel a medical practitioner to treat\n\na patient, who will die if not treated, contrary to the express\n\nwishes of the patient. It does not compel the temporary\n\nkeeping alive of patients who are terminally ill where to do so\n\nwould merely prolong their suffering. On the other hand, it\n\nforbids the taking of active measures to cut short the life of a\n\nterminally ill patient.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_73\">53. Lord Keith further stated that it does no violence to the\n\nprinciple of sanctity of life to hold that it is lawful to cease to\n\ngive medical treatment and care to a PVS patient who has\n\nbeen in that state for over three years considering that to do so\n\ninvolves invasive manipulation of the patient&#x27;s body to which\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_139\">\f                                61</span>\n\n\nhe has not consented and which confers no benefit upon him.\n\nHe also observed that the decision whether or not the\n\ncontinued treatment and care of a PVS patient confers any\n\nbenefit on him is essentially one for the practitioners in\n\ncharge.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_74\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_75\">54. Lord Goff of Chieveley also held that the principle of\n\nsanctity of life is not an absolute one and there is no absolute\n\nrule that the patient&#x27;s life must be prolonged by such\n\ntreatment    or   care,   if   available,   regardless    of   the\n\ncircumstances.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_76\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_77\">55. Lord Goff observed that though he agreed that the\n\ndoctor&#x27;s conduct in discontinuing life support can properly be\n\ncategorised as an omission, yet discontinuation of life support\n\nis, for the present purposes, no different from not initiating life\n\nsupport in the first place as in such a case, the doctor is\n\nsimply allowing his patient to die in the sense that he is\n\ndesisting from taking a step which might, in certain\n\ncircumstances, prevent his patient from dying as a result of\n\nhis pre-existing condition; and as a matter of general\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_140\">\f                                62</span>\n\n\nprinciple, an omission such as this will not be unlawful unless\n\nit constitutes a breach of duty to the patient.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_78\">56. The learned Law Lord further observed that the doctor&#x27;s\n\nconduct is to be differentiated from that of, for example, an\n\ninterloper who maliciously switches off a life support machine\n\nin the sense that although the interloper performs the same\n\nact as the doctor who discontinues life support, yet the doctor,\n\nin discontinuing life support, is simply allowing his patient to\n\ndie of his pre-existing condition, whereas the interloper is\n\nactively intervening to stop the doctor from prolonging the\n\npatient&#x27;s life, and such conduct cannot possibly be categorised\n\nas an omission. This distinction as per Lord Goff appears to be\n\nuseful in the context as it can be invoked to explain how\n\ndiscontinuance of life support can be differentiated from\n\nending a patient&#x27;s life by a lethal injection. Lord Goff stated\n\nthat the reason for this difference is that the law considers\n\ndiscontinuance of life support to be consistent with the\n\ndoctor&#x27;s duty to care for his patient, but it does not, for\n\nreasons of policy, consider that it forms any part of his duty to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_141\">\f                                           63</span>\n\n\ngive his patient a lethal injection to put the patient out of his\n\nagony.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_79\">57. Emphasising on the patient&#x27;s best interest principle, Lord\n\nGoff referred to F v. West Berkshire Health Authority 21\n\nwherein the House of Lords stated the legal principles\n\ngoverning the treatment of a patient who, for the reason that\n\nhe was of unsound mind or that he had been rendered\n\nunconscious by accident or by illness, was incapable of stating\n\nwhether or not he consented to the treatment or care. In such\n\ncircumstances, a doctor may lawfully treat such a patient if he\n\nacts in his best interests, and indeed, if the patient is already\n\nin his care, he is under a duty so to treat him.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_80\">58. Drawing an analogy, Lord Goff opined that a decision by\n\na doctor whether or not to initiate or to continue to provide\n\ntreatment or care which could or might have the effect of\n\nprolonging such a patient&#x27;s life should also be governed by the\n\nsame fundamental principle of the patient&#x27;s best interest. The\n\nlearned Law Lord further stated that the doctor who is caring\n\nfor such a patient cannot be put under an absolute obligation\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_142\">21</span>\n     [1989] 2 All ER 545 : [1990] 2 AC 1\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_143\">\f                               64</span>\n\n\nto prolong his life by any means available to the doctor,\n\nregardless of the quality of the patient&#x27;s life. Common\n\nhumanity requires otherwise as do medical ethics and good\n\nmedical practice accepted in the United Kingdom and\n\noverseas. Lord Goff said that the doctor&#x27;s decision to take or\n\nnot to take any step must be made in the best interests of the\n\npatient (subject to his patient&#x27;s ability to give or withhold his\n\nconsent).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_81\">59. Lord Goff further stated that in such cases, the question\n\nis not whether it is in the best interests of the patient that he\n\nshould die, rather the correct question for consideration is\n\nwhether it is in the best interests of the patient that his life\n\nshould be prolonged by the continuance of such form of\n\nmedical treatment or care. In Lord Goff‘s view, the correct\n\nformulation of the question is of particular importance in such\n\ncases as the patient is totally unconscious and there is no\n\nhope whatsoever of any amelioration of his condition. Lord\n\nGoff opined that if the question is asked whether it is in the\n\nbest interests of the patient to continue the treatment which\n\nhas the effect of artificially prolonging his life, that question\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_144\">\f                                  65</span>\n\n\ncan sensibly be answered to the effect that the patient&#x27;s best\n\ninterests no longer require such a treatment to be continued.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_82\">60. Lord Goff opined that medical treatment is neither\n\nappropriate nor requisite simply to prolong a patient&#x27;s life\n\nwhen such treatment has no therapeutic purpose of any kind\n\nand   such    treatment    is    futile    because   the   patient   is\n\nunconscious and there is no prospect of any improvement in\n\nhis condition. Thereafter, the learned Law Lord observed that\n\nregard should also be had to the invasive character of the\n\ntreatment and to the indignity to which a patient is subjected\n\nby prolonging his life by artificial means which, in turn,\n\ncauses considerable distress to his family. In such cases, Lord\n\nGoff said that it is the futility of the treatment which justifies\n\nits termination and in such circumstances, a doctor is not\n\nrequired to initiate or to continue life- prolonging treatment or\n\ncare keeping in mind the best interests of the patient.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_83\">61. Lord     Goff,   referring    to      West   Berkshire    Health\n\nAuthority (supra), said that it was stated therein that where a\n\ndoctor provides treatment to a person who is incapacitated\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_145\">\f                                             66</span>\n\n\nfrom saying whether or not he consents to it, the doctor must,\n\nwhen deciding on the form of treatment, act in accordance\n\nwith a responsible and competent body of relevant professional\n\nopinion on the principles set down in Bolam v. Friern\n\nHospital Management Committee 22 . Lord Goff opined that\n\nthis principle must equally be applicable to decisions to\n\ninitiate or to discontinue life support as it is to other forms of\n\ntreatment. He also referred to a Discussion Paper on\n\nTreatment of Patients in Persistent Vegetative State issued in\n\nSeptember, 1992 by the Medical Ethics Committee of the\n\nBritish Medical Association pertaining to four safeguards in\n\nparticular which, in the Committee&#x27;s opinion, should be\n\nobserved before discontinuing life support for such patients,\n\nwhich were: (1) every effort should be made at rehabilitation\n\nfor at least six months after the injury; (2) the diagnosis of\n\nirreversible PVS should not be considered confirmed until at\n\nleast 12 months after the injury with the effect that any\n\ndecision to withhold life-prolonging treatment will be delayed\n\nfor that period; (3) the diagnosis should be agreed by two other\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_146\">22</span>\n     [1957] 1 W.L.R. 582 : [1957] 2 All ER 118\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_147\">\f                                              67</span>\n\n\nindependent doctors; and (4) generally, the wishes of the\n\npatient&#x27;s immediate family will be given great weight.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_84\">62. According to him,                   the        views   expressed   by     the\n\nCommittee on the subject of consultation with the relatives of\n\nPVS patients are consistent with the opinion expressed by the\n\nHouse of Lords in West Berkshire Health Authority (supra)\n\nthat it is good practice for the doctor to consult relatives. Lord\n\nGoff observed that the Committee was firmly of the opinion\n\nthat the relatives&#x27; views would not be determinative of the\n\ntreatment inasmuch as if that would have been the case, the\n\nrelatives would be able to dictate to the doctors what is in the\n\nbest interests of the patient which cannot be right. Even so, a\n\ndecision           to     withhold     life-prolonging     treatment   such   as\n\nartificial feeding must require close cooperation with those\n\nclose to the patient and it is recognised that, in practice, their\n\nviews and the opinions of doctors will coincide in many cases.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_85\">63. Thereafter, Lord Goff referred to American cases, namely,\n\nRe Quinlan 23 and Superintendent of Belchertown State\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_148\">23</span>\n     355 A. 2d 647 : (1976) 70 NJ 10\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_149\">\f                                                    68</span>\n\n\nSchool v. Saikewicz24 wherein the American Courts adopted\n\nwhat is called the substituted judgment test which involves a\n\ndetailed inquiry into the patient&#x27;s views and preferences. As\n\nper the substituted judgment test, when the patient is\n\nincapacitated from expressing any view on the question\n\nwhether life-prolonging treatment should be withheld, an\n\nattempt is made to determine what decision the patient\n\nhimself would have made had he been able to do so. In later\n\nAmerican cases concerning PVS patients, it has been held that\n\nin the absence of clear and convincing evidence of the patient&#x27;s\n\nwishes, the surrogate decision-maker has to implement as far\n\nas possible the decision which the incompetent patient would\n\nhave made if he was competent.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_86\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_87\">64. However, Lord Goff acknowledged that any such test\n\n(substituted judgment test) does not form part of English law\n\nin relation to incompetent adults on whose behalf nobody has\n\npower to give consent to medical treatment. In contrast,\n\nEngland followed a straightforward test based on the best\n\ninterests of the patient coined by the House of Lords in West\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_150\">24</span>\n     (1977) 373 Mass 728 : 370 N.E. 2d 417 (1977)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_151\">\f                              69</span>\n\n\nBerkshire Health Authority (supra). He opined that the\n\nsame test (patient&#x27;s best interest) should be applied in the\n\ncase of PVS patients where the question is whether life-\n\nprolonging treatment should be withheld. The learned Law\n\nLord further observed that consistent with the best interests\n\ntest, anything relevant to the application of the test may also\n\nbe taken into account and if the personality of the patient is\n\nrelevant to the application of the test (as it may be in cases\n\nwhere the various relevant factors have to be weighed), it may\n\nbe taken into account as was done in Re J. (A Minor)\n\n(Wardship: Medical Treatment) (supra). But where the\n\nquestion is whether life support should be withheld from a\n\nPVS patient, it is difficult to see how the personality of the\n\npatient can be relevant, though it may be of comfort to his\n\nrelatives if they believe, as in the present case, and indeed\n\nmay well be so in many other cases, that the patient would\n\nnot have wished his life to be artificially prolonged if he was\n\ntotally unconscious and there was no hope of improvement in\n\nhis condition.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_152\">\f                               70</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_88\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_89\">65. As regards the extent to which doctors should, as a\n\nmatter of practice, seek the guidance of the court by way of an\n\napplication for declaratory relief before withholding life-\n\nprolonging treatment from a PVS patient, Lord Goff took note\n\nof the judgment of Sir Stephen Brown P, the President of the\n\nFamily Division, wherein he held that the opinion of the court\n\nshould be sought in all cases of similar nature. Lord Goff also\n\nnoted that Sir Thomas Bingham M.R. in the Court of Appeal\n\nexpressed his agreement with Sir Stephen Brown P. in the\n\nfollowing words:-\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_90\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_64\">     &quot;This was in my respectful view a wise ruling,\n     directed to the protection of patients, the protection\n     of doctors, the reassurance of patients&#x27; families and\n     the reassurance of the public. The practice\n     proposed seems to me desirable. It may very well be\n     that with the passage of time a body of experience\n     and practice will build up which will obviate the\n     need for application in every case, but for the time\n     being I am satisfied that the practice which the\n     President described should be followed.‖\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_91\">66. It is worthy to mention that Lord Goff was of the view\n\nthat there was a considerable cost involved in obtaining\n\nguidance from the court in cases of such nature. He took note\n\nof the suggestions forwarded by Mr. Francis, the counsel for\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_153\">\f                               71</span>\n\n\nthe respondents, to the effect that reference to the court was\n\nrequired in certain specific cases, i.e., (1) where there was\n\nknown to be a medical disagreement as to the diagnosis or\n\nprognosis, and (2) problems had arisen with the patient‘s\n\nrelatives-disagreement by the next of kin with the medical\n\nrecommendation; actual or apparent conflict of interest\n\nbetween the next of kin and the patient; dispute between\n\nmembers of the patient‘s family; or absence of any next of kin\n\nto give consent. Lord Goff said that the President of the Family\n\nDivision should be able to relax the present requirement so as\n\nto limit applications for declarations only to those cases in\n\nwhich there is a special need for the procedure to be invoked.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_92\">67. Lord Mustill observed that an argument had been\n\nadvanced that it was in the best interest of the community at\n\nlarge that Anthony Bland‘s life should end. The doctors had\n\ndone all they could have done. It was a lose-lose situation as\n\nnothing would be gained by continuing Bland‘s treatment and\n\nmuch would be lost. The distress of Bland‘s family members\n\nwould steadily get worse and so would be the strain of the\n\nmedical staff charged with the care of Bland despite the fact\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_154\">\f                               72</span>\n\n\nthat Bland&#x27;s condition would never improve and he would\n\nnever recognize that he was being cared for. Further, the\n\nlearned Law Lord observed that large resources in terms of\n\nskill, labour and money had been applied for maintaining\n\nBland in his present condition which, in the opinion of many,\n\ncould be fruitfully employed in improving the conditions of\n\nother patients who, if treated, may have useful, healthy and\n\nenjoyable lives for years to come.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_93\">68. Lord Lowry, agreeing with the reasoning of Lord Goff of\n\nChieveley with whom the other learned Law Lords were also in\n\ngeneral agreement, dismissed the appeal. In coming to this\n\nconclusion, Lord Lowry opined that the court, in reaching a\n\ndecision according to law, ought to give weight to informed\n\nmedical opinion both on the point whether to continue the\n\nartificial feeding regime of a patient in PVS and also on the\n\nquestion of what is in the best interests of a patient. Lord\n\nLowry rejected the idea that informed medical opinion in these\n\nrespects was merely a disguise which, if accepted, would\n\nlegalise euthanasia. Lord Lowry also rejected the Official\n\nSolicitor&#x27;s argument that the doctors were under a &quot;duty to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_155\">\f                                73</span>\n\n\nfeed&quot; their patients in PVS as in the instant case, the doctors\n\noverwhelmingly held the opposite view which had been upheld\n\nby the courts below. The doctors considered that it was in the\n\npatient&#x27;s best interests that they should stop feeding him. Lord\n\nLowry observed that the learned Law Lords had gone further\n\nby saying that the doctors are not entitled to feed a patient in\n\nPVS without his consent which cannot be obtained.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_94\">69. Lord Lowry further opined that there is no proposed\n\nguilty act in stopping the artificial feeding regime inasmuch as\n\nif it is not in the interests of an insentient patient to continue\n\nthe life- supporting care and treatment, the doctor would be\n\nacting unlawfully if he continued the care and treatment and\n\nwould perform no guilty act by discontinuing it. There is a gap\n\nbetween the old law on the one hand and new medicine and\n\nnew ethics on the other. It is important, particularly in the\n\narea of criminal law which governs conduct, that the society&#x27;s\n\nnotions of what the law is and what is right should coincide.\n\nOne role of the legislator, as per Lord Lowry, is to detect any\n\ndisparity between these notions and to take appropriate action\n\nto close the gap.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_156\">\f                                74</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_95\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_96\">70. Lord Browne-Wilkinson observed that the ability to\n\nsustain life artificially is a relatively recent phenomenon.\n\nExisting law may not provide an acceptable answer to the new\n\nlegal questions which it raises.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_97\">71. In the opinion of the learned Law Lord, there exists no\n\ndoubt that it is for the Parliament and not the courts to decide\n\nthe broader issues raised by cases of such nature. He\n\nobserved that recent developments in medical science have\n\nfundamentally changed the meaning of death. In medicine, the\n\ncessation of breathing or of heartbeat is no longer death\n\nbecause by the use of a ventilator, lungs which in the unaided\n\ncourse of nature stop breathing can be made to breathe\n\nartificially thereby sustaining the heartbeat. Thus, people like\n\nAnthony Bland, who would have previously died through\n\ninability to swallow food, can be kept alive by artificial feeding.\n\nThis has led the medical profession, in Lord Browne-\n\nWilkinson&#x27;s view, to redefine death in terms of brain stem\n\ndeath, i.e., the death of that part of the brain without which\n\nthe body cannot function at all without assistance. He further\n\nsaid that if the judges seek to develop new law to regulate the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_157\">\f                                75</span>\n\n\nnew circumstances, the law so laid down will reflect the\n\njudges&#x27; views on the underlying ethical questions, questions\n\non which there is a legitimate division of opinion. He\n\nproceeded to state that where a case raises wholly new moral\n\nand social issues, it is neither for the judges to develop new\n\nprinciples of law nor would it be legitimate for the Judges to\n\narrive at a conclusion as to what is for the benefit of one\n\nindividual whose life is in issue.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_98\">72. For the said reasons, the learned Law Lord observed that\n\nit is imperative that the moral, social and legal issues raised\n\nby the case at hand should be considered by the Parliament\n\nand only if the Parliament fails to act, the judge-made law\n\nwill, by necessity, provide a legal answer to each new question\n\nas and when it arises.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_99\">73. The function of the court, in Lord Browne-Wilkinson&#x27;s\n\nview, in such circumstances is to determine a particular case\n\nin accordance with the existing law and not to develop new\n\nlaw laying down a new regimen. He held that it is for the\n\nParliament to address the wider problems which such a case\n\nraises and lay down principles of law generally applicable to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_158\">\f                               76</span>\n\n\nthe withdrawal of life support systems. He explained why the\n\nremoval of the nasogastric tube in the present case could not\n\nbe regarded as a positive act causing death since the tube\n\nitself, without the food being supplied through it, does\n\nnothing. The removal of the tube by itself does not cause\n\ndeath since it does not sustain life by itself. Therefore, the\n\nremoval of the tube would not constitute the actus reus of\n\nmurder since such positive act would not be the cause of\n\ndeath.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_100\">74. Thus, Lord Browne-Wilkinson observed that in case of an\n\nadult who is mentally competent, the artificial feeding regime\n\nwould be unlawful unless the patient consented to it as a\n\nmentally competent patient can, at any time, put an end to life\n\nsupport systems by refusing his consent to their continuation.\n\nHe also observed that the House of Lords in West Berkshire\n\nHealth Authority (supra) developed the principle based on\n\nthe concept of necessity under which a doctor can lawfully\n\ntreat a patient who cannot consent to such treatment if it is in\n\nthe best interests of the patient to receive such treatment. The\n\nlearned Law Lord opined that the correct answer to the case at\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_159\">\f                               77</span>\n\n\nhand depends on the extent of the right to lawfully continue to\n\ninvade the bodily integrity of Anthony Bland without his\n\nconsent. To determine the extent of the said right, Lord\n\nBrowne-Wilkinson observed that it can be deduced from West\n\nBerkshire Health Authority (supra) wherein both Lord\n\nBrandon of Oakbrook and Lord Goff made it clear that the\n\nright to administer invasive medical care is wholly dependent\n\nupon such care being in the best interests of the patient and\n\nmoreover, a doctor&#x27;s decision whether to continue invasive\n\ncare is in the best interests of the patient has to be assessed\n\nwith reference to the test laid down in Bolam (supra).\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_101\">75. Lord Browne-Wilkinson held that if there comes a stage\n\nwhere   a   responsible   doctor    comes   to   the   reasonable\n\nconclusion (which accords with the views of a responsible body\n\nof medical opinion) that further continuance of an intrusive\n\nlife support system is not in the best interests of the patient,\n\nthe doctor can no longer lawfully continue that life support\n\nsystem as to do so would constitute the crime of battery and\n\nthe tort of trespass.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_160\">\f                                                        78</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_102\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_103\">76. In Lord Browne-Wilkinson‘s view, the correct legal\n\nquestion in such cases is not whether the court thinks it is in\n\nthe best interests of the patient in PVS to continue to receive\n\nintrusive medical care but whether the doctor responsible has\n\narrived at a reasonable and bona fide belief that it is not in the\n\nbest interests of the patient to continue to receive artificial\n\nmedical regime.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_104\">77. Accordingly, Lord Browne-Wilkinson observed that on an\n\napplication              to      the      court         for       a       declaration    that   the\n\ndiscontinuance of medical care will be lawful, the sole concern\n\nof the courts is to be satisfied that the doctor&#x27;s decision to\n\ndiscontinue is in accordance with a respectable body of\n\nmedical opinion and that it is reasonable. Adverting to various\n\npassages, Lord Browne-Wilkinson dismissed the appeal.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_105\">78. It is pertinent to mention here that in adopting the ―best\n\ninterests‖ principle in Airedale, the House of Lords followed\n\nits        earlier       decision          in      In        re       F    (Mental      Patient   :\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_65\">Sterilisation] 25 and in adopting the omission/commission\n\ndistinction, it followed the approach of the Court of Appeal in\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_161\">25</span>\n     [1990] 2 AC 1 : [1989] 2 WLR 1025 : [1989] 2 All ER 545\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_162\">\f                                                      79</span>\n\n\nIn re B (A Minor) (Wardship : Medical Treatment)26 and In\n\nre J (A Minor) (Wardship : Medical Treatment) 27 which\n\nraised the question of medical treatment for severely disabled\n\nchildren. In the context of cases where the patients are unable\n\nto communicate their wishes, it is pertinent to mention the\n\nobservations made by Lord Goff in the Airedale case.                                  As\n\nobserved by Lord Goff, the correct question in cases of this\n\nkind would be ―whether it is in his best interests that\n\ntreatment which has the effect of artificially prolonging his life\n\nshould be continued‖. Thus, it was settled in the case of\n\nAiredale that it was lawful for the doctors to discontinue\n\ntreatment if the patient refuses such treatment. And in case\n\nthe        patient         is    not      in     a     situation   permitting   him   to\n\ncommunicate his wishes, then it becomes the responsibility of\n\nthe doctor to act in the ―best interest‖ of the patient.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_66\">H.1.2               Later cases:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_67\">79.         With reference to the ongoing debate pertaining to\n\nassisted dying, Lord Steyn in the case of R (on the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_163\">26</span>\n     [1981] 1 WLR 1424 : [1990] 3 All ER 927\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_164\">27</span>\n     [1991] Fam 33 : [1990] 3 All ER 930 : [1991] 2 WLR 140\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_165\">\f                                          80</span>\n\n\napplication of Pretty) v. Director of Public Prosecutions28\n\nexplained that on one hand is the view which finds support in\n\nthe Roman Catholic Church, Islam and other religions that\n\nhuman life is sacred and the corollary is that euthanasia and\n\nassisted suicide are always wrong, while on the other hand, as\n\nobserved by Lord Steyn, is the belief defended by millions that\n\nthe personal autonomy of individuals is predominant and it is\n\nthe moral right of individuals to have a say over the time and\n\nmanner of their death. Taking note of the imminent risk in\n\nlegalizing assisted dying, Lord Steyn took note of the\n\nutilitarian argument that the terminally ill patients and those\n\nsuffering great pain from incurable illnesses are often\n\nvulnerable and not all families, whose interests are at stake,\n\nare wholly unselfish and loving and there exists the probability\n\nof abuse in the sense that such people may be persuaded that\n\nthey want to die or that they ought to want to die. Further,\n\nLord Steyn observed that there is also the view that if the\n\ngenuine wish of a terminally ill patient to die is expressed by\n\nthe patient, then they should not be forced against their will to\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_166\">28</span>\n     [2002] 1 All ER 1 : [2001] UKHL 61\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_167\">\f                                               81</span>\n\n\nendure a life that they no longer wish to endure. Without\n\nexpressing any view on the unending arguments on either\n\nside, Lord Steyn noted that these wide-ranging arguments are\n\nancient questions on which millions have taken diametrically\n\nopposite views and still continue to do.            In the case of In re B\n\n(Consent to Treatment – Capacity)29, the primacy of patient\n\nautonomy, that is, the competent patient‘s right to decide for\n\nherself whether to submit to medical treatment over other\n\nimperatives, such as her best interests objectively considered,\n\nwas recognized thereby confirming the right of the competent\n\npatient to refuse medical treatment even if the result is death\n\nand thus, a competent, ventilator-dependent patient sought\n\nand won the right to have her ventilator turned off.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_68\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"116125276\" id=\"span_168\">80. Taking a slightly divergent view from Airedale, Lord\n\nNeuberger in <a href=\"/doc/116125276/\" id=\"a_96\">R (on the application of Nicklinson and\n\nanother) v. Ministry of Justice30</a> observed that the difference\n\nbetween administering fatal drug to a person and setting up a\n\nmachine so that the person can administer the drug to himself\n\nis not merely a legal distinction but also a moral one and,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_169\">29</span>\n     [2002] 1 FLR 1090 : [2002] 2 All ER 449\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_170\">30</span>\n     [2014] UKSC 38\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_171\">\f                               82</span>\n\n\nindeed, authorizing a third party to switch off a person‘s life\n\nsupport   machine,   as   in   Airedale,   is   a   more   drastic\n\ninterference and a more extreme moral step than authorizing a\n\nthird party to set up a lethal drug delivery system to enable a\n\nperson, only if he wishes, to activate the system to administer\n\na lethal drug. Elaborating further on this theory, the Law Lord\n\nexplained that in those cases which are classified as\n\n―omission‖, for instance, switching off a life support machine\n\nas in Airedale and Re B (Treatment), the act which\n\nimmediately causes death is that of a third party which may\n\nbe wrong whereas if the final act is that of a person who\n\nhimself carries it out pursuant to a voluntary, clear, settled\n\nand informed decision, that may be the permissible side of the\n\nline as in the latter case, the person concerned had not been\n\n―killed‖ by anyone but had autonomously exercised his right to\n\nend his life. The Law Lord, however, immediately clarified that\n\nit is not intended to cast any doubt on the correctness of the\n\ndecisions in Airedale and Re B (Treatment).</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_69\">81. Suffice it to say, he concurred with the view in Airedale\n\ncase which he referred to as Bland case. Lord Mance agreed\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_172\">\f                              83</span>\n\n\nwith Lord Neuberger and Lord Sumption. In his opinion, he\n\nreferred to Airedale case and thereafter pointed out that a\n\nblanket prohibition was unnecessary and stated in his\n\nobservations that persons in tragic position represent a\n\ndistinct and relatively small group, and that by devising a\n\nmechanism enabling careful prior review (possibly involving\n\nthe Court as well as medical opinion), the vulnerable can be\n\ndistinguished from those capable of forming a free and\n\ninformed   decision    to   commit   suicide.

Lord Mance referred to the expression by Rehnquist CJ\n\nin Washington (supra) in a slightly different context that\n\nthere is ―an earnest and profound debate about the morality,\n\nlegality, and practicality of …. assisted suicide‖ and ―our\n\nholding permits this debate to continue as it should in a\n\ndemocratic society‖.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_173\">\f                               84</span>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_72\">84. Lord Wilson concurred with the judgment rendered by\n\nLord Neuberger, referred to Airedale case and said:-\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_73\">     ―As Hoffmann LJ suggested in his classic judgment\n     in the Court of Appeal in Airedale NHS Trust v\n     Bland [1993] AC 789 at 826, a law will forfeit\n     necessary support if it pays no attention to the\n     ethical dimension of its decisions. In para 209 below\n     Lord Sumption quotes Hoffmann LJ‘s articulation of\n     that principle but it is worth remembering that\n     Hoffmann LJ then proceeded to identify two other\n     ethical principles, namely those of individual\n     autonomy and of respect for human dignity, which\n     can run the other way.‖\n\nAnd further:-\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_74\">     ―In the Pretty case, at para 65, the ECHR was later\n     to describe those principles as of the very essence of\n     the ECHR. It was in the light (among other things)\n     of the force of those two principles that in the Bland\n     case the House of Lords ruled that it was lawful in\n     certain circumstances for a doctor not to continue\n     to provide life-sustaining treatment to a person in a\n     persistent vegetative state…‖\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_75\">     200. I agree with the observation of Lord Neuberger\n     at para 94 that, in sanctioning a course leading to\n     the death of a person about which he was unable to\n     have a voice, the decision in the Bland case was\n     arguably more extreme than any step which might\n     be taken towards enabling a person of full capacity\n     to exercise what must, at any rate now, in the light\n     of the effect given to <a href=\"/doc/691208/\" id=\"a_97\">article 8</a> of the ECHR in the\n     Haas case at para 51, cited at para 29 above, be\n     regarded as a positive legal right to commit suicide.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_106\">     Lord Sumption suggests in para 212-213 below that\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_174\">\f                              85</span>\n\n\n     it remains morally wrong and contrary to public\n     policy for a person to commit suicide. Blackstone, in\n     his Commentaries on the Laws of England, Book 4,\n     Chapter 14, wrote that suicide was also a spiritual\n     offence ―in evading the prerogative of the Almighty,\n     and rushing into his immediate presence uncalled\n     for‖. If expressed in modern religious terms, that\n     view would still command substantial support and a\n     moral argument against committing suicide could\n     convincingly be cast in entirely non-religious terms.\n     Whether, however, it can be elevated into an overall\n     conclusion about moral wrong and public policy is\n     much more difficult.‖\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_107\">85. Lord Sumption commenced the judgment stating that\n\nEnglish judges tend to avoid addressing the moral foundations\n\nof law. It is not their function to lay down principles of\n\nmorality and the attempt leads to large generalisations which\n\nare commonly thought to be unhelpful. He further observed\n\nthat in some cases, however, it is unavoidable and this is one\n\nof them. He referred to the opinion of Hoffmann LJ in\n\nAiredale case and the concept of sanctity of life and,\n\neventually, reproduced a passage from Hoffmann LJ and\n\nopined:-\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_108\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_76\">     ―215. Why should this be so? There are at least\n     three reasons why the moral position of the suicide\n     (whom I will call ―the patient‖ from this point on,\n     although the term may not always be apt) is\n     different from that of a third party who helps him to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_175\">\f                          86</span>\n\n\nkill himself. In the first place, the moral quality of\ntheir decisions is different. A desire to die can only\nresult from an overpowering negative impulse\narising from perceived incapacity, failure or pain.\nThis is an extreme state which is unlikely to be\nshared by the third party who assists. Even if the\nassister is moved by pure compassion, he inevitably\nhas a greater degree of detachment. This must in\nparticular be true of professionals such as doctors,\nfrom whom a high degree of professional objectivity\nis expected, even in situations of great emotional\ndifficulty. Secondly, whatever right a person may\nhave to put an end to his own life depends on the\nprinciple of autonomy, which leaves the disposal of\nhis life to him. The right of a third party to assist\ncannot depend on that principle. It is essentially\nbased on the mitigating effect of his compassionate\nmotive. Yet not everyone seeking to end his life is\nequally deserving of compassion. The choice made\nby a person to kill himself is morally the same\nwhether he does it because he is old or terminally\nill, or because he is young and healthy but fed up\nwith life. In both cases his desire to commit suicide\nmay be equally justified by his autonomy. But the\nchoice made by a third party who intervenes to help\nhim is very different. The element of compassion is\nmuch stronger in the former category than in the\nlatter. Third, the involvement of a third party raises\nthe problem of the effect on other vulnerable people,\nwhich the unaided suicide does not. If it is lawful for\na third party to encourage or assist the suicide of a\nperson who has chosen death with a clear head,\nfree of external pressures, the potential arises for\nhim to encourage or assist others who are in a less\ngood position to decide. Again, this is a more\nsignificant factor in the case of professionals, such\nas doctors or carers, who encounter these dilemmas\nregularly, than it is in the case of, say, family\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_176\">\f                               87</span>\n\n\n     members confronting them for what will probably be\n     the only time in their lives.‖\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_109\">86. Dealing with the appeal by Nicklinson, Lord Sumption\n\nreferred to the view of the Canadian Supreme Court in\n\nRodriguez (supra) and opined:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_77\">     ―….the issue is an inherently legislative issue for\n     Parliament, as the representative body in our\n     constitution, to decide. The question what\n     procedures might be available for mitigating the\n     indirect consequences of legalising assisted\n     suicide, what risks such procedures would entail,\n     and whether those risks are acceptable, are not\n     matters which under our constitution a court\n     should decide.‖\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_110\">87.

But it\n     is worth reiterating these well-established\n     propositions, because it is clear that many\n     medical professionals are frightened by the law\n     and take an unduly narrow view of what can\n     lawfully be done to relieve the suffering of the\n     terminally ill under the law as it presently\n     stands. Much needless suffering may be\n     occurring as a result.

Unlike the Court of Appeals, we think the\n     distinction   between      assisting     suicide  and\n     withdrawing life-sustaining treatment, a distinction\n     widely recognized and endorsed in the medical\n     profession 6 and in our legal traditions, is both\n     important and logical; it is certainly rational.‖\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_183\">\f                               94</span>\n\n\n     Dealing with the conclusion in Cruzan (supra), it was\n\nheld:-\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_87\">     ―This Court has also recognized, at least implicitly,\n     the distinction between letting a patient die and\n     making that patient die.

But our assumption of a\n     right to refuse treatment was grounded not, as the\n     Court of Appeals supposed, on the proposition that\n     patients have a general and abstract ―right to\n     hasten death,‖ 80 F. 3d, at 727–728, but on well-\n     established, traditional rights to bodily integrity and\n     freedom from unwanted touching, Cruzan, 497 U.\n     S., at 278–279; id., at 287– 288 (O‘Connor, J.,\n     concurring).

This, the Court said, is in sharp contrast to a doctor\n\nwho honours a patient‘s request to end life which necessarily\n\nrequires more than an intent to respect the patient‘s wishes,\n\ni.e., it requires the intent to kill the patient. A major difference,\n\nthe Court determined, in the two scenarios is that the former\n\nmay cause the patient to die from underlying causes while the\n\nlatter will cause the patient to die. The Court noted that the\n\nlaw plainly recognized the difference between ―killing‖ and\n\n―letting die‖.

The Special Joint\n\nCommittee released its report in February 2016 recommending\n\na   legislative   framework       which   would   regulate   ‗medical\n\nassistance in dying‘ by imposing both substantive and\n\nprocedural safeguards, namely:-\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_197\">\f                             102</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_134\">\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_93\">Substantive Safeguards:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_94\">   A grievous and irremediable medical condition (including\n    an illness, disease or disability) is required;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_95\">   Enduring suffering that is intolerable to the individual in\n    the circumstances of his or her condition is required;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_96\">   Informed consent is required;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_97\">   Capacity to make the decision is required at the time of\n    either the advance or contemporaneous request; and\n\n   Eligible individuals must be insured persons eligible for\n    publicly funded health care services in Canada.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_98\">Procedural Safeguards:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_99\">   Two independent doctors must conclude that a person is\n    eligible;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_100\">   A request must be in writing and witnessed by two\n    independent witnesses;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_101\">   A waiting period is required based, in part, on the\n    rapidity of progression and nature of the patient‘s\n    medical condition as determined by the patient‘s\n    attending physician;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_102\">   Annual report analyzing medical assistance in dying\n    cases are to be tabled in Parliament;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_103\">    and\n\n\n   Support and services, including culturally and spiritually\n    appropriate end-of-life care services for indigenous\n    patients, should be improved to ensure that requests are\n    based on free choice, particularly for vulnerable people.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_198\">\f                                103</span>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_135\">105. It should be noted that physician assisted dying has\n\nalready been legalized in the province of Quebec.         Quebec\n\npassed an Act respecting end-of-life care (the Quebec Act) in\n\nJune 2014 with most of the Act coming into force on 10\n\nDecember, 2015. The Quebec Act provides a ‗framework for\n\nend-of-life care‘ which includes ‗continuous palliative sedation‘\n\nand ‗medical aid in dying‘ defined as ‗administration by a\n\nphysician of medications or substances to an end-of-life\n\npatient, at the patient‘s request, in order to relieve their\n\nsuffering by hastening death.     In order to be able to access\n\nmedical aid in dying under the Quebec Act, a patient must:-\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_104\">(1)   be an insured person within the meaning of the Health\n      Insurance Act (Chapter A-29);\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_105\">(2)   be of full age and capable of giving consent to care;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_106\">(3)   be at the end of life;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_107\">(4)   suffer from a serious and incurable illness;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_108\">(5)   be in an advanced state of irreversible decline in\n      capability; and\n\n(6)   experience    constant    and   unbearable     physical   or\n      psychological suffering\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_199\">\f                                   104</span>\n\n\n(7)   which cannot be relieved in a manner the patient deems\n      tolerable.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_136\">106. The request for medical aid in dying must be signed by\n\ntwo   physicians.        The   Quebec     Act   also   established     a\n\nCommission on end-of-life care to provide oversight and advice\n\nto the Minister of Health and Social Services on the\n\nimplementation of the legislation regarding end-of-life care.\n\n\nH.5 Other Jurisdictions:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_137\">107. Presently, we think it appropriate to deal with certain\n\nlegislations in other countries and the decisions in other\n\njurisdictions. In Aruna Shanbaug, the Court has in detail\n\nreferred   to      the   legislations    in   Netherlands,   i.e.,   the\n\nTermination of Life on Request and Assisted Suicide (Review\n\nProcedures) Act, 2002 that regulates euthanasia.                     The\n\nprovisions of the said Act lay down that euthanasia and\n\nphysician-assisted suicide are not punishable if the attending\n\nphysician acts in accordance with the criteria of due care. As\n\nthe two-Judge Bench has summarized, this criteria concern\n\nthe patient‘s request, the patient‘s suffering (unbearable and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_200\">\f                                     105</span>\n\n\nhopeless), the information provided to the patient, the\n\npresence of reasonable alternatives, consultation of another\n\nphysician   and      the   applied     method   of   ending   life.   To\n\ndemonstrate their compliance, the Act requires physicians to\n\nreport euthanasia to a Review Committee. It has been\n\nobserved that the said Act legalizes euthanasia and physician-\n\nassisted suicide in very specific cases under three specific\n\nconditions and euthanasia remains a criminal offence in cases\n\nnot meeting the laid down specific conditions with the\n\nexception of several situations that are not subject to\n\nrestrictions of law at all because they are considered normal\n\nmedical practice. The three conditions are : stopping or not\n\nstarting a medically useless (futile) treatment, stopping or not\n\nstarting a treatment at the patient‘s request and speeding up\n\ndeath as a side effect of treatment necessary for alleviating\n\nserious suffering.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_138\">108. Reference has been made to the Swiss Criminal Code\n\nwhere active euthanasia has been regarded as illegal. Belgium\n\nhas legalized the practice of euthanasia with the enactment of\n\nthe Belgium Act on Euthanasia of May 28th, 2002 and the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_201\">\f                               106</span>\n\n\npatients can wish to end their life if they are under constant\n\nand unbearable physical or psychological pain resulting from\n\nan accident or an incurable illness. The Act allows adults who\n\nare in a ‗futile medical condition of constant and unbearable\n\nphysical or mental suffering that cannot be alleviated‘ to\n\nrequest    voluntary   euthanasia.    Doctors    who    practise\n\neuthanasia commit no offence if the prescribed conditions and\n\nprocedure is followed and the patient has the legal capacity\n\nand the request is made voluntarily and repeatedly with no\n\nexternal pressure.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_139\">109. Luxembourg too has legalized euthanasia with the\n\npassing of the Law of 16th March, 2009 on Euthanasia and\n\nAssisted Suicide (Lux.). The law permits euthanasia and\n\nassisted suicide in relation to those with incurable conditions\n\nwith the requirements including repeated requests and the\n\nconsent of two doctors and an expert panel.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_140\">110. The position in Germany is that active assisted suicide is\n\nillegal. However, this is not the case for passive assisted\n\nsuicide.   Thus, in Germany, if doctors stop life-prolonging\n\nmeasures, for instance, on the written wishes of a patient, it is\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_202\">\f                               107</span>\n\n\nnot considered as a criminal offence. That apart, it is legal for\n\ndoctors in Germany to administer painkillers to a dying\n\npatient to ease pain. The said painkillers, in turn, cause low\n\nbreathing that may lead to respiratory arrest and, ultimately,\n\ndeath.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_141\">H.6 International considerations and decisions of the\n    European Court of Human Rights (ECHR):\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_142\">111. Certain relevant obligations when discussing voluntary\n\neuthanasia are contained in the International Covenant on\n\nCivil and Political Rights (ICCPR). The following rights in the\n\nICCPR have been considered by the practice of voluntary\n\neuthanasia:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_109\">   right to life (<a href=\"/doc/19636/\" id=\"a_105\">Article 6</a>)\n   freedom from cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment\n    (<a href=\"/doc/735354/\" id=\"a_106\">Article 7</a>)\n   right to respect for private life (<a href=\"/doc/1987997/\" id=\"a_107\">Article 17</a>)\n   freedom of thought, conscience and religion (<a href=\"/doc/1163710/\" id=\"a_108\">Article 18</a>).\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_143\">112. Right to life under <a href=\"/doc/241477/\" id=\"a_109\">Article 6(1)</a> of the ICCPR provides:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_110\">Every human being has the inherent right to life. This right\n\nshall be protected by law. No one shall be arbitrarily deprived\n\nof his life. The second sentence of <a href=\"/doc/241477/\" id=\"a_110\">Article 6(1)</a> imposes a\n\npositive obligation on the States to provide legal protection of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_203\">\f                                108</span>\n\n\nthe right to life. However, the subsequent reference to life not\n\nbeing ‗arbitrarily deprived‘ operates to limit the scope of the\n\nright (and therefore the States‘ duty to ensure the right).\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_111\">Comments from the UN Human Rights Committee suggest\n\nthat laws allowing for voluntary euthanasia are not necessarily\n\nincompatible with the States‘ obligation to protect the right to\n\nlife.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_144\">113. The UN Human Rights Committee has emphasised that\n\nlaws allowing for euthanasia must provide effective procedural\n\nsafeguards against abuse if they are to be compatible with the\n\nState‘s obligation to protect the right to life. In 2002, the UN\n\nCommittee considered the euthanasia law introduced in the\n\nNetherlands. The Committee stated that:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_112\">        ―where a State party seeks to relax legal protection\n        with respect to an act deliberately intended to put\n        an end to human life, the Committee believes that\n        the Covenant obliges it to apply the most rigorous\n        scrutiny to determine whether the State party‘s\n        obligations to ensure the right to life are being\n        complied with (<a href=\"/doc/1456610/\" id=\"a_111\">articles 2</a> and <a href=\"/doc/19636/\" id=\"a_112\">6</a> of the Covenant).‖\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_145\">114. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has\n\nadopted a similar position to the UN Human Rights Committee\n\nwhen considering euthanasia laws and the right to life in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_204\">\f                                            109</span>\n\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1456610/\" id=\"a_113\">Article 2</a> of the European Convention for the Protection of\n\nHuman              Rights        and    Fundamental    Freedoms   (European\n\nConvention). According to the ECHR, the right to life in <a href=\"/doc/1456610/\" id=\"a_114\">Article\n\n2</a> cannot be interpreted as conferring a right to die or a right\n\nto self determination in terms of choosing death rather than\n\nlife. However, the ECHR has held that a State‘s obligation to\n\nprotect life under that Article does not preclude it from\n\nlegalising voluntary euthanasia, provided adequate safeguards\n\nare put in place and adhered to. In Pretty v. United Kingdom\n\n(application no. 2346/02)                   37   , the ECHR ruled that the\n\ndecision of the applicant to avoid what she considered would\n\nbe an undignified and distressing end to her life was part of\n\nthe private sphere covered by the scope of <a href=\"/doc/691208/\" id=\"a_115\">Article 8</a> of the\n\nConvention. The Court affirmed that the right of an individual\n\nto decide how and when to end her life, provided that the said\n\nindividual was in a position to make up her own mind in that\n\nrespect and to take the appropriate action, was one aspect of\n\nthe right to respect for private life under <a href=\"/doc/691208/\" id=\"a_116\">Article 8</a> of the\n\nConvention. The Court, thus, recognised, with conditions, a\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_205\">37</span>\n     [2002] ECHR 423 (29 April, 2002)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_206\">\f                                           110</span>\n\n\nsort of right to self-determination as to one‘s own death, but\n\nthe existence of this right is subject to two conditions, one\n\nlinked to the free will of the person concerned and the other\n\nrelating to the capacity to take appropriate action. However,\n\nrespect for the right to life compels the national authorities to\n\nprevent a person from putting an end to life if such a decision\n\nis not taken freely and with full knowledge.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_146\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_147\">115. In Hass v.

In a recent decision regarding end of life issues, Lambert\n\nand others v. France (application no. 46043/14) 39 , the\n\nECHR considered whether the decision to withdraw artificial\n\nnutrition and hydration of Vincent Lambert violated the right\n\nto life in <a href=\"/doc/1456610/\" id=\"a_118\">Article 2.</a> Vincent Lambert was involved in a serious\n\nroad accident which left him tetraplegic and with permanent\n\nbrain damage. He was assessed in expert medical reports as\n\nbeing in a chronic vegetative state that required artificial\n\nnutrition and hydration to be administered via a gastric tube.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_150\">117. Mr. Lambert‘s parents applied to the ECHR alleging that\n\nthe decision to withdraw his artificial nutrition and hydration\n\nbreached, inter alia, the State‘s obligations under <a href=\"/doc/1456610/\" id=\"a_119\">Article 2</a> of\n\nthe European Convention. The ECHR highlighted that <a href=\"/doc/1456610/\" id=\"a_120\">Article 2</a>\n\nimposes on the States both a negative obligation (to refrain\n\nfrom the ‗intentional‘ taking of life) and a positive obligation (to\n\n‗take appropriate steps to safeguard the lives of those within\n\nits jurisdiction‘). The Court held that the decision of a doctor\n\nto       discontinue   life-sustaining   treatment   (or   ‗therapeutic\n\nabstention‘) did not involve the State‘s negative obligation\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_209\">39</span>\n     [2015] ECHR 185\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_210\">\f                               112</span>\n\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1456610/\" id=\"a_121\">Article 2</a> and, therefore, the only question for the Court\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1456610/\" id=\"a_122\">Article 2</a> was whether it was consistent with the State‘s\n\npositive obligation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_151\">118. The ECHR emphasized that ‗the Convention has to be\n\nread as a whole‘, and, therefore:-\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_152\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_116\">     ―in a case such as the present one reference should\n     be made, in examining a possible violation of <a href=\"/doc/1456610/\" id=\"a_123\">Article\n     2</a>, to <a href=\"/doc/691208/\" id=\"a_124\">Article 8</a> of the Convention and to the right to\n     respect for private life and the notion of personal\n     autonomy which it encompasses.‖\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_153\">119. The Court noted that there was a consensus among\n\nEuropean member States ‗as to the paramount importance of\n\nthe patient‘s wishes in the decision-making process, however\n\nthose wishes are expressed‘. It identified that in dealing with\n\nend of life situations, States have some discretion in terms of\n\nstriking a balance between the protection of the patients‘ right\n\nto life and the protection of the right to respect their private\n\nlife and their personal autonomy. The Court considered that\n\nthe provisions of the Law of 22 April 2005 ‗on patients‘ rights\n\nand the end of life‘ promulgated in France making changes in\n\nthe French Code of Public Health, as interpreted by the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_211\">\f                                113</span>\n\n\nConseil d’Etat, constituted a legal framework which was\n\nsufficiently clear to regulate with precision the decisions taken\n\nby doctors in situations such as in Mr. Lambert‘s case. The\n\nCourt found the legislative framework laid down by domestic\n\nlaw, as interpreted by the Conseil d’État, and the decision-\n\nmaking process which had been conducted in meticulous\n\nfashion, to be compatible with the requirements of the State‘s\n\npositive obligation under <a href=\"/doc/1456610/\" id=\"a_125\">Article 2.</a>    With respect to negative\n\nobligations,   the   ECHR    observed     that   the   ―therapeutic\n\nabstention‖ (that is, withdrawal and withholding of medical\n\ntreatment) lacks the intention to end the patient‘s life and\n\nrather, a doctor discontinuing medical treatment from his or\n\nher patient merely intends to ―allow death to resume its\n\nnatural course and to relieve suffering‖. Therefore, as long as\n\ntherapeutic abstention as authorised by the French Public\n\nHealth Code is not about taking life intentionally, the ECHR\n\nopined that France had not violated its negative obligation to\n\n―refrain from the intentional taking of life‖.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_154\">120. When considering the State‘s positive obligations to\n\nprotect human life, the ECHR noted that the regulatory\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_212\">\f                              114</span>\n\n\nframework developed in the Public Health Code and the\n\ndecision of the Conseil d’ Etat established several ―important\n\nsafeguards‖ with respect to therapeutic abstention and the\n\nregulation is, therefore, ―apt to ensure the protection of\n\npatients‘ lives.‖\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_155\">121. All this compelled the ECHR to conclude that there was\n\nno violation of the State‘s positive obligation to protect human\n\nlife which, together with the absence of violation of negative\n\nobligations, resulted in the conclusion that ―there would be no\n\nviolation of <a href=\"/doc/1456610/\" id=\"a_126\">Article 2</a> of the Convention in the event of\n\nimplementation of the Conseil d’ Etat judgment.‖     Thus, the\n\nECHR in the Lambert (supra) case struck the balance between\n\nthe sanctity of life on the one hand and the notions of quality\n\nof life and individual autonomy on the other.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_156\">\nI.   The 241st Report of The Law Commission of India on\n     Passive Euthanasia:\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_157\">122. After the judgment of Aruna Shanbaug was delivered,\n\nthe Law Commission of India submitted its 241st report which\n\ndealt with ‗Passive Euthanasia – A Relook‘. The report in its\n\nintroduction has dealt with the origin of the concept of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_213\">\f                               115</span>\n\n\neuthanasia.   It states that the word ―Euthanasia‖ is derived\n\nfrom the Greek words ―eu‖ and ―thanotos‖ which literally mean\n\n―good death‖ and is otherwise described as ―mercy killing‖.\n\nThe word euthanasia, as pointed out in the Report, was used\n\nby Francis Bacon in the 17th Century to refer to an easy,\n\npainless and happy death as it is the duty and responsibility\n\nof the physician to alleviate the physical suffering of the body\n\nof the patient. A reference has also been made in the Report\n\nto the meaning given to the term by the House of Lords. The\n\nSelect Committee on ―Medical Ethics‖ in England defined\n\nEuthanasia as ―a deliberate intervention undertaken with the\n\nexpress intention of ending a life to relieve intractable\n\nsuffering‖.   Impressing   upon      the   voluntary   nature   of\n\neuthanasia, the report has rightly highlighted the clarification\n\nas provided by the European Association of Palliative Care\n\n(EAPC) Ethics Task Force in a discussion on Euthanasia in\n\n2003 to the effect that ―medicalised killing of a person without\n\nthe person‘s consent, whether non-voluntary (where the\n\nperson is unable to consent) or involuntary (against the\n\nperson‘s will) is not euthanasia: it is a murder.‖\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_214\">\f                              116</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_158\">123.

The report rightly points out that a rational and\n\nhumanitarian outlook should have primacy in such a complex\n\nmatter. Recognizing that passive euthanasia, both in the case\n\nof competent and incompetent patients, is being allowed in\n\nmost of the countries subject to the doctor acting in the best\n\ninterests of the patient, the report summarized the broad\n\nprinciples of medical ethics which shall be observed by the\n\ndoctor in taking the decision. The said principles as obtained\n\nin the report are the patient‘s autonomy (or the right to self-\n\ndetermination) and beneficence which means following a\n\ncourse of action that is best for the patient uninfluenced by\n\npersonal convictions, motives or other considerations. The\n\nReport also refers to the observations made by Lord Keith in\n\nAiredale case providing for a course to safeguard the patient‘s\n\nbest interest.   As per the said course, which has also been\n\napproved by this Court, the hospital/medical practitioner\n\nshould apply to the Family Division of the High Court for\n\nendorsing or reversing the decision taken by the medical\n\npractitioners in charge to discontinue the treatment of a PVS\n\npatient.   With respect to the ongoing debates on ―legalizing\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_216\">\f                               118</span>\n\n\neuthanasia‖, the Report reiterates the observations made in\n\nAiredale that euthanasia (other than passive euthanasia) can\n\nbe legalized by means of legislation only.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_160\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_161\">125.

The patient‘s life is at the brink\n     of extinction. There is no slightest hope of recovery.\n     The patient undergoing terrible suffering and worst\n     mental agony does not want his life to be prolonged\n     by artificial means. She/he would not like to spend\n     for his treatment which is practically worthless.\n     She/he cares for his bodily integrity rather than\n     bodily suffering. She/he would not like to live 28\n     like a ‗cabbage‘ in an intensive care unit for some\n     days or months till the inevitable death occurs. He\n     would like to have the right of privacy protected\n     which implies protection from interference and\n     bodily invasion. As observed in Gian Kaur‘s case,\n     the natural process of his death has already\n     commenced and he would like to die with peace and\n     dignity. No law can inhibit him from opting such\n     course. This is not a situation comparable to\n     suicide, keeping aside the view point in favour of\n     decriminalizing the attempt to suicide. The doctor or\n     relatives cannot compel him to have invasive\n     medical treatment by artificial means or treatment.‖\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_163\">126.

The Report also laid emphasis on the\n\nopinion of Lord Goff placing the right of self-determination on\n\na high pedestal. The said relevant observations of Lord Goff,\n\nas also cited in the Report, are as follows:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_119\">     ―I wish to add that, in cases of this kind, there is no\n     question of the patient having committed suicide,\n     nor therefore of the doctor having aided or abetted\n     him in doing so. It is simply that the patient has, as\n     he is entitled to do, declined to consent to treatment\n     which might or would have the effect of prolonging\n     his life, and the doctor has, in accordance with his\n     duty, complied with his patient&#x27;s wishes.‖\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_164\">127.

The recognition of the freedom of competent adults to\n\nmake    choices    about    their     medical   care   necessarily\n\nencompasses recognition of the right to make choices since\n\nindividual free choice and self-determination are themselves\n\nfundamental constituents of life. Robins J.A. further clarified\n\nin Malette at page 334:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_122\">     ―To deny individuals freedom of choice with respect\n     to their health care can only lessen and not\n     enhance the value of life.‖\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_170\">131. In the 21st century, with the advancement of technology\n\nin medical care, it has become possible, with the help of\n\nsupport machines, to prolong the death of patients for months\n\nand even years in some cases. At this juncture, the right to\n\nrefuse medical treatment comes into the picture. A patient\n\n(terminally ill or in a persistent vegetative state) exercising the\n\nright to refuse treatment may ardently wish to live but, at the\n\nsame time, he may wish to be free from any medical surgery,\n\ndrugs or treatment of any kind so as to avoid protracted\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_224\">\f                                122</span>\n\n\nphysical suffering.   Any such person who has come of age\n\nand is of sound mind has a right to refuse medical treatment.\n\nThis right stands on a different pedestal as compared to\n\nsuicide, physician assisted suicide or even euthanasia. When a\n\nterminally ill patient refuses to take medical treatment, it can\n\nneither be termed as euthanasia nor as suicide. Albeit, both\n\nsuicide and refusal to take treatment in case of terminal\n\nailment shall result in the same consequences, that is, death,\n\nyet refusal to take treatment by itself cannot amount to\n\nsuicide. In case of suicide, there has to be a self initiated\n\npositive action with a specific intention to cause one‘s own\n\ndeath. On the other hand, a patient‘s right to refuse treatment\n\nlacks his specific intention to die, rather it protects the patient\n\nfrom unwanted medical treatment. A patient refusing medical\n\ntreatment merely allows the disease to take its natural course\n\nand if, in this process, death occurs, the cause for it would\n\nprimarily be the underlying disease and not any self initiated\n\nact.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_171\">132.

In Secretary, Department of Health and Community\n\nServices (NT) v.

It was further observed that\n\nunder the doctrine of trespass, the common law respects and\n\nprotects the autonomy of adult persons and also accepts the\n\nright to self-determination in respect of his or her body which\n\ncan be altered only with the consent of the person concerned.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_174\">134. There is a presumption of capacity whereby an adult is\n\npresumed to have the capacity to consent to or to refuse\n\nmedical treatment unless and until that presumption is\n\nrebutted. Butler-Sloss LJ, in Re MB (Medical Treatment)45,\n\nstated that in deciding whether a person has the capacity to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_226\">44</span>\n     (1992) 66 AJLR 300 : (1992) 175 CLR 218\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_227\">45</span>\n     [1997] EWCA Civ 3093 : [1997] 2 FLR 426\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_228\">\f                               124</span>\n\n\nmake a particular decision, the ultimate question is whether\n\nthat person suffers from some impairment or disturbance of\n\nmental functioning so as to render him or her incapable of\n\nmaking the decision.      The consent may be vitiated if the\n\nindividual concerned may not have been competent in law to\n\ngive or refuse that consent; or even if the individual was\n\ncompetent in law, the decision has been obtained by undue\n\ninfluence or some other vitiating means; or the apparent\n\nconsent or refusal does not extend to the particular situation;\n\nor the terms of the consent or refusal are ambiguous or\n\nuncertain; or if the consent or refusal is based on incorrect\n\ninformation or incorrect assumption. In circumstances where\n\nit is practicable for a medical practitioner to obtain consent to\n\ntreatment, then, for the consent to be valid, it must be based\n\non full information, including as to its risks and benefits.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_175\">135. Where it is not practicable for a medical practitioner to\n\nobtain consent for treatment and where the patient‘s life is in\n\ndanger if appropriate treatment is not given, then the\n\ntreatment may be administered without consent.            This is\n\njustified by what is sometimes called the ―emergency principle‖\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_229\">\f                                125</span>\n\n\nor ―principle of necessity‖.   Usually, the medical practitioner\n\ntreats the patient in accordance with his clinical judgment of\n\nwhat is in the patient‘s best interests. Lord Goff of Chieveley\n\nhas rightly pointed out in F v. West Berkshire Health\n\nAuthority (supra) that for the principle of necessity to apply,\n\ntwo conditions must be met:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_124\">(a)   There must be ―a necessity to act when it is not\n\npracticable to communicate with the assisted person‖; and\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_125\">(b)   ―the action taken must be such as a reasonable person\n\nwould in all the circumstances take, acting in the best\n\ninterests of the assisted person.‖\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_176\">136. However, Lord Goff pointed out that the principle of\n\nnecessity does not apply where the proposed action is contrary\n\nto the known wishes of the assisted person to the extent that\n\nhe/she is capable of rationally forming such a wish. It follows\n\nthat the principle of necessity cannot be relied upon to justify\n\na particular form of medical treatment where the patient has\n\ngiven an advance care directive specifying that he/she does\n\nnot wish to be so treated and where there is no reasonable\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_230\">\f                                126</span>\n\n\nbasis for doubting the validity and applicability of that\n\ndirective.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_177\">K.

Protection of life and personal liberty.—No\n     person shall be deprived of his life or personal\n     liberty except according to procedure established by\n     law.‖\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_180\">138. The word ‗liberty‘ is the sense and realization of choice of\n\nthe attributes associated with the said choice; and the term\n\n‗life‘ is the aspiration to possess the same in a dignified\n\nmanner. The two are intrinsically interlinked. Liberty impels\n\nan individual to change and life welcomes the change and the\n\nmovement. Life does not intend to live sans liberty as it would\n\nbe, in all possibility, a meaningless survival. There is no doubt\n\nthat no fundamental right is absolute, but any restraint\n\nimposed on liberty has to be reasonable. Individual liberty aids\n\nin developing one‘s growth of mind and assert individuality.\n\nShe/he may not be in a position to rule others but\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_231\">\f                               127</span>\n\n\nindividually, she/he has the authority over the body and\n\nmind. The liberty of personal sovereignty over body and mind\n\nstrengthens the faculties in a person. It helps in their\n\ncultivation. Roscoe Pound, in one of his lectures, has aptly\n\nsaid:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_127\">     ―… although we think socially, we must still think of\n     individual interests, and of that greatest of all\n     claims which a human being may make, the claim\n     to assert his individuality, to exercise freely the will\n     and the reason which God has given him. We must\n     emphasize the social interest in the moral and\n     social life of the individual, but we must remember\n     that it is the life of a free-willing being.‖\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_181\">139. Liberty allows freedom       of speech, association and\n\ndissemination without which the society may face hurdles in\n\nattaining the requisite maturity. History is replete with\n\nnarratives how the thoughts of individuals, though not\n\naccepted by the contemporaneous society, later on gained not\n\nonly acceptance but also respect.      One may not agree with\n\nKantian rigorism, but one must appreciate that without the\n\nsaid doctrine, there could not have been dissemination of\n\nfurther   humanistic    principles.   There   is   a   danger   in\n\ndiscouraging free thinking and curtailing the power of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_232\">\f                                            128</span>\n\n\nimagination. Holmes in Adkins v. Children’s Hospital46 has\n\nobserved:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_128\">           ―It is merely an example of doing what you want to\n           do, embodied in the word ―liberty‖.‖\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_182\">140. The concept of liberty perceives a hazard when it feels it\n\nis likely to become hollow. This necessarily means that there\n\nwould be liberty available to individuals subject to permissible\n\nlegal restraint and it should be made clear that in that\n\nrestraint, free ideas cannot be imprisoned by some kind of\n\nunknown terror.                    Liberty cannot be a slave because it\n\nconstitutes the essential marrow of life and that is how we\n\nintend to understand the conception of liberty when we read it\n\nin association with the term ‗life‘ as used in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_131\">Article 21</a> of the\n\nConstitution.                The   great   American   playwright   Tennessee\n\nWilliams has said:-\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_183\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_129\">           ―To be free is to have achieved your life.‖\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_184\">141.

The expression ‗life‘ has a much wider meaning\n\nand, therefore, where the outcome of a departmental enquiry\n\nis likely to adversely affect the reputation or livelihood of a\n\nperson, some of the finer graces of human civilization which\n\nmake life worth living would be jeopardized and the same can\n\nbe put in jeopardy only by law which inheres fair procedures.</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_185\">142. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1766147\" id=\"span_236\">In <a href=\"/doc/1766147/\" id=\"a_134\">Maneka Gandhi v.

Human dignity not only finds place in the\n\nPreamble of this important document but also in <a href=\"/doc/1406924/\" id=\"a_151\">Article 1</a> of\n\nthe same.

The concept and value of dignity requires further\n\nelaboration since we are treating it as an inextricable facet of\n\nright to life that respects all human rights that a person\n\nenjoys. Life is basically self-assertion. In the life of a person,\n\nconflict and dilemma are expected to be normal phenomena.\n\nOliver Wendell Holmes, in one of his addresses, quoted a line\n\nfrom a Latin poet who had uttered the message, ―Death plucks\n\nmy ear and says, Live- I am coming‖. That is the significance\n\nof living. But when a patient really does not know if he/she is\n\nliving till death visits him/her and there is constant suffering\n\nwithout any hope of living, should one be allowed to wait?\n\nShould she/he be cursed to die as life gradually ebbs out from\n\nher/his being? <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"91938676\" id=\"span_262\">Should she/he live because of innovative\n\nmedical technology or, for that matter, should he/she\n\ncontinue to live with the support system as people around\n\nhim/her think that science in its progressive invention may\n\nbring about an innovative method of cure? To put it\n\ndifferently, should he/she be ―guinea pig‖ for some kind of\n\nexperiment?

Recently, in <a href=\"/doc/91938676/\" id=\"a_155\">K.S.

Life is precious in itself. But life is worth living\n     because of the freedoms which enable each\n     individual to live life as it should be lived. The best\n     decisions on how life should be lived are entrusted\n     to the individual. They are continuously shaped by\n     the social milieu in which individuals exist. The\n     duty of the State is to safeguard the ability to take\n     decisions — the autonomy of the individual — and\n     not to dictate those decisions. ―Life‖ within the\n     meaning of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_156\">Article 21</a> is not confined to the integrity\n     of the physical body. The right comprehends one‘s\n     being in its fullest sense.

To live is to live with dignity. The draftsmen of\n     the Constitution defined their vision of the society in\n     which constitutional values would be attained by\n     emphasising, among other freedoms, liberty and\n     dignity. So fundamental is dignity that it permeates\n     the core of the rights guaranteed to the individual\n     by Part III. Dignity is the core which unites the\n     fundamental rights because the fundamental rights\n     seek to achieve for each individual the dignity of\n     existence. Privacy with its attendant values assures\n     dignity to the individual and it is only when life can\n     be enjoyed with dignity can liberty be of true\n     substance. Privacy ensures the fulfilment of dignity\n     and is a core value which the protection of life and\n     liberty is intended to achieve.‖\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_264\">\f                                     140</span>\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_200\">154. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"24661153\" id=\"span_265\">In <a href=\"/doc/24661153/\" id=\"a_157\">Mehmood Nayyar Azam v.

The aforesaid expression may appear\n           to be an individualistic expression of a great\n           personality, but, when it is understood in the\n           complete sense, it really denotes, in its conceptual\n           essentiality, and connotes, in its macrocosm, the\n           fundamental perception of a thinker about the\n           respect that life commands. The reverence of life is\n           insegragably associated with the dignity of a human\n           being who is basically divine, not servile. A human\n           personality is endowed with potential infinity and it\n           blossoms when dignity is sustained. The sustenance\n           of such dignity has to be the superlative concern of\n           every sensitive soul.

Every act which offends against or\n           impairs human dignity would constitute deprivation\n           protanto of this right to live and it would have to be\n           in accordance with reasonable, fair and just\n           procedure established by law which stands the test\n           of other fundamental rights. Now obviously, any\n           form of torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading\n           treatment would be offensive to human dignity and\n           constitute an inroad into this right to live and it\n           would, on this view, be prohibited by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_161\">Article 21</a>\n           unless it is in accordance with procedure prescribed\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_272\">58</span>\n     (1981) 1 SCC 608\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_273\">\f                                    143</span>\n\n\n           by law, but no law which authorises and no\n           procedure which leads to such torture or cruel,\n           inhuman or degrading treatment can ever stand the\n           test of reasonableness and non-arbitrariness: it\n           would plainly be unconstitutional and void as being\n           violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_162\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_163\">21.</a> It would thus be seen\n           that there is implicit in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_164\">Article 21</a> the right to\n           protection against torture or cruel, inhuman or\n           degrading treatment which is enunciated in <a href=\"/doc/1937835/\" id=\"a_165\">Article\n           5</a> of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and\n           guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/735354/\" id=\"a_166\">Article 7</a> of the International\n           Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_203\">157. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"195593310\" id=\"span_274\">In <a href=\"/doc/195593310/\" id=\"a_167\">National Legal Services Authority v.

In the said case, the Court was primarily\n\nconcerned with the question of constitutional validity of <a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_170\">Sections\n\n306</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1501595/\" id=\"a_171\">309</a> of IPC. The Court was conscious of the fact that the\n\ndebate on euthanasia was not relevant for deciding the question\n\nunder consideration. The Court, however, in no uncertain terms\n\nexpounded that the word &quot;life&quot; in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_172\">Article 21</a> has been construed\n\nas life with human dignity and it takes within its ambit the &quot;right\n\nto die with dignity&quot; being part of the &quot;right to live with dignity&quot;.\n\nFurther, the &quot;right to live with human dignity&quot; would mean\n\nexistence of such a right upto the end of natural life which would\n\ninclude the right to live a dignified life upto the point of death\n\nincluding the dignified procedure of death. While adverting to the\n\nsituation of a dying man who is terminally ill or in a persistent\n\nvegetative state where he may be permitted to terminate it by a\n\npremature extinction of his life, the Court observed that the said\n\ncategory of cases may fall within the ambit of &quot;right to die with\n\ndignity&quot; as part of the right to live with dignity when death due to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_280\">\f                                 145</span>\n\n\nthe termination of natural life is certain and imminent and the\n\nprocess of natural death has commenced, for these are not cases\n\nof extinguishing life but only of accelerating the conclusion of the\n\nprocess of natural death which has already commenced. The\n\nsequitur of this exposition is that there is little doubt that a\n\ndying man who is terminally ill or in a persistent vegetative state\n\ncan make a choice of premature extinction of his life as being a\n\nfacet of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_173\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. If that choice is\n\nguaranteed being part of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_174\">Article 21</a>, there is no necessity of any\n\nlegislation for effectuating that fundamental right and more so\n\nhis natural human right. Indeed, that right cannot be an\n\nabsolute right but subject to regulatory measures to be\n\nprescribed by a suitable legislation which, however, must be\n\nreasonable restrictions and in the interests of the general public.\n\nIn the context of the issue under consideration, we must make it\n\nclear that as part of the right to die with dignity in case of a dying\n\nman who is terminally ill or in a persistent vegetative state, only\n\npassive euthanasia would come within the ambit of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_175\">Article 21</a>\n\nand not the one which would fall within the description of active\n\neuthanasia in which positive steps are taken either by the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_281\">\f                               146</span>\n\n\ntreating physician or some other person. That is because the\n\nright to die with dignity is an intrinsic facet of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_176\">Article 21.</a> The\n\nconcept that has been touched deserves to be concretised, the\n\nthought has to be realized. It has to be viewed from various\n\nangles, namely, legal permissibility, social and ethical ethos\n\nand medical values.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_207\">160. The purpose of saying so is only to highlight that the law\n\nmust take cognizance of the changing society and march in\n\nconsonance with the developing concepts. The need of the\n\npresent has to be served with the interpretative process of law.\n\nHowever, it is to be seen how much strength and sanction can\n\nbe drawn from the Constitution to consummate the changing\n\nideology and convert it into a reality. The immediate needs are\n\nrequired to be addressed through the process of interpretation\n\nby the Court unless the same totally falls outside the\n\nconstitutional framework or the constitutional interpretation\n\nfails to recognize such dynamism. The Constitution Bench in\n\nGian Kaur, as stated earlier, distinguishes attempt to suicide\n\nand abetment of suicide from acceleration of the process of\n\nnatural death which has commenced.          The authorities, we\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_282\">\f                               147</span>\n\n\nhave noted from other jurisdictions, have observed the\n\ndistinctions between the administration of lethal injection or\n\ncertain   medicines   to   cause     painless   death   and   non-\n\nadministration of certain treatment which can prolong the life\n\nin cases where the process of dying that has commenced is not\n\nreversible or withdrawal of the treatment that has been given\n\nto the patient because of the absolute absence of possibility of\n\nsaving the life. To explicate, the first part relates to an overt\n\nact whereas the second one would come within the sphere of\n\ninformed consent and authorized omission. The omission of\n\nsuch a nature will not invite any criminal liability if such\n\naction is guided by certain safeguards. The concept is based\n\non non-prolongation of life where there is no cure for the state\n\nthe patient is in and he, under no circumstances, would have\n\nliked to have such a degrading state. The words ―no cure‖ have\n\nto be understood to convey that the patient remains in the\n\nsame state of pain and suffering or the dying process is\n\ndelayed by means of taking recourse to modern medical\n\ntechnology. It is a state where the treating physicians and the\n\nfamily members know fully well that the treatment is\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_283\">\f                                148</span>\n\n\nadministered only to procrastinate the continuum of breath of\n\nthe individual and the patient is not even aware that he is\n\nbreathing. Life is measured by artificial heartbeats and the\n\npatient has to go through this undignified state which is\n\nimposed on him. The dignity of life is denied to him as there is\n\nno other choice but to suffer an avoidable protracted\n\ntreatment thereby thus indubitably casting a cloud and\n\ncreating a dent in his right to live with dignity and face death\n\nwith dignity, which is a preserved concept of bodily autonomy\n\nand right to privacy. In such a stage, he has no old memories\n\nor any future hopes but he is in a state of misery which\n\nnobody ever desires to have. Some may also silently think that\n\ndeath, the inevitable factum of life, cannot be invited. To meet\n\nsuch situations, the Court has a duty to interpret <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_177\">Article 21</a> in\n\na further dynamic manner and it has to be stated without any\n\ntrace of doubt that the right to life with dignity has to include\n\nthe smoothening of the process of dying when the person is in\n\na vegetative state or is living exclusively by the administration\n\nof artificial aid that prolongs the life by arresting the dignified\n\nand inevitable process of dying. Here, the issue of choice also\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_284\">\f                                                      149</span>\n\n\ncomes in. Thus analysed, we are disposed to think that such a\n\nright would come within the ambit of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_178\">Article 21</a> of the\n\nConstitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_208\">\nL.         Right of self-determination and individual autonomy:\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_209\">161. Having dealt with the right to acceleration of the process\n\nof dying a natural death which is arrested with the aid of\n\nmodern innovative technology as a part of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_179\">Article 21</a> of the\n\nConstitution, it is necessary to address the issues of right of\n\nself-determination and individual autonomy.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_210\">162. John Rawls says that the liberal concept of autonomy\n\nfocuses            on      choice         and        likewise,          self-determination   is\n\nunderstood as exercised through the process of choosing 61 .\n\nThe respect for an individual human being and in particular\n\nfor his right to choose how he should live his own life is\n\nindividual autonomy or the right of self- determination. It is\n\nthe right against non-interference by others, which gives a\n\ncompetent person who has come of age the right to make\n\ndecisions concerning his or her own life and body without any\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_285\">61</span>\n     Rawls, John, Political Liberalism 32, 33, New York: Columbia University Press, 1993.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_286\">\f                                            150</span>\n\n\n\ncontrol or interference of others. Lord Hoffman, in Reeves v.\n\nCommissioner of Police of the Metropolis62 has stated:-\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_146\">         &quot;Autonomy means that every individual is sovereign\n         over himself and cannot be denied the right to\n         certain kinds of behaviour, even if intended to cause\n         his own death.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_211\">163. In the context of health and medical care decisions, a\n\nperson&#x27;s exercise of self-determination and autonomy involves\n\nthe exercise of his right to decide whether and to what extent\n\nhe/she is willing to submit himself/herself to medical\n\nprocedures and treatments, choosing amongst the available\n\nalternative treatments or, for that matter, opting for no\n\ntreatment at all which, as per his or her own understanding, is\n\nin consonance with his or her own individual aspirations and\n\nvalues.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_212\">164. In Airedale (supra), Lord Goff has expressed that it is\n\nestablished that the principle of self-determination requires\n\nthat respect must be given to the wishes of the patient so that\n\nif   an         adult       patient   of   sound   mind   refuses,   however\n\nunreasonably, to consent to treatment or care by which\n\n62 [2000] 1   AC 360, 379\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_287\">\f                                151</span>\n\n\n\nhis/her life would or might be prolonged, the doctors\n\nresponsible for his/her care must give effect to his/her wishes,\n\neven though they do not consider it to be in his/her best\n\ninterests to do so and to this extent, the principle of sanctity of\n\nhuman life must yield to the principle of self-determination.\n\nLord Goff further says that the doctor&#x27;s duty to act in the best\n\ninterests of his patient must likewise be qualified with the\n\npatient&#x27;s right of self determination. Therefore, as far as the\n\nUnited Kingdom is concerned, it is generally clear that\n\nwhenever there is a conflict between a capable adult&#x27;s exercise\n\nof the right of self-determination and the State&#x27;s interest in\n\npreserving human life by treating it as sanctimonious, the\n\nright of the individual must prevail.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_213\">165. In the United States, the aspect of self-determination and\n\nindividual autonomy is concretised in law as all fifty States\n\nalong with the District of Columbia, the capital, which is\n\ncommonly     referred   as   Washington     D.C.,   have   passed\n\nlegislations upholding different forms of Advance Directives. In\n\nthe United States, even before the enactment of the said laws,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_288\">\f                                          152</span>\n\n\n\na terminally ill person was free to assert the right to die as an\n\nancillary right to the constitutionally protected right to\n\nprivacy. In In Re Quinlan (supra), where a 21 year old girl in\n\nchronic PVS was on ventilator support, the Court, while\n\nweighing Quinlan&#x27;s right to privacy qua the State&#x27;s interest in\n\npreserving human life, found that as the degree of bodily\n\ninvasion increases and the prognosis for the patient&#x27;s recovery\n\ndims, the patient&#x27;s right to privacy increases and the State&#x27;s\n\ninterest weakens. The Supreme Court of New Jersey finally\n\nruled that the unwritten constitutional right of privacy was\n\nbroad enough to encompass a patient&#x27;s decision to decline\n\nmedical treatment in certain circumstances. Again, in Re\n\nJobes63, which was also a case concerned with a PVS patient,\n\nthe Court, following the decision in In Re Quinlan, upheld the\n\nprinciple           of     self   determination   and   autonomy   of   an\n\nincompetent person.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_214\">166. The Canadian Criminal Code asserts and protects the\n\nsanctity of life in a number of ways which directly confront the\n\nautonomy of the terminally ill in their medical decision\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_289\">63</span>\n     (1987) 108 N.J. 394\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_290\">\f                                  153</span>\n\n\n\nmaking. However, the Supreme Court of Canada in Reibl v.\n\nHughes64 approved an oft-quoted statement of Cardozo J. in\n\nScholoendorf (supra) that &quot;every human being of adult years\n\nand sound mind has a right to determine what shall be done\n\nwith his own body&quot; and Chief Justice Laskin in Reibl (supra)\n\nhas further added that battery would lie where surgery or\n\ntreatment was performed without consent or where apart from\n\nemergency situations, surgery or medical treatment was given\n\nbeyond that to which there was consent. Thus, the Supreme\n\nCourt of Canada suggested that competent adults have the\n\nright to make their own medical decisions even if such\n\ndecisions are unwise.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_215\">167. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"235821\" id=\"span_291\">In <a href=\"/doc/235821/\" id=\"a_180\">Aruna Shanbaug</a> (supra), this Court has observed that\n\nautonomy means the right to self-determination where the\n\ninformed patient has a right to choose the manner of his\n\ntreatment. To be autonomous the patient should be competent to\n\nmake decisions and choices. In the event that he is incompetent\n\nto make choices, his wishes expressed in advance in the form of\n\na Living Will, or the wishes of surrogates acting on his behalf\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_292\">64</span>\n     [1980 2 SCR 880 at 890-891\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_293\">\f                                154</span>\n\n\n\n(&#x27;substituted judgment&#x27;) are to be respected. The surrogate is\n\nexpected to represent what the patient may have decided had\n\nhe/she been competent or to act in the patient&#x27;s best interest. It\n\nis expected that a surrogate acting in the patient&#x27;s best interest\n\nfollows a course of action because it is best for the patient, and\n\nis not influenced by personal convictions, motives or other\n\nconsiderations.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_216\">168. Thus, enquiring into common law and statutory rights\n\nof terminally ill persons in other jurisdictions would indicate\n\nthat all adults with the capacity to consent have the common\n\nlaw right to refuse medical treatment and the right of self\n\ndetermination.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_217\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_218\">169. We may, however, add a word of caution that doctors\n\nwould be bound by the choice of self-determination made by\n\nthe patient who is terminally ill and undergoing a prolonged\n\nmedical treatment or is surviving on life support, subject to\n\nbeing satisfied that the illness of the patient is incurable and\n\nthere is no hope of his being cured. Any other consideration\n\ncannot pass off as being in the best interests of the patient.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_294\">\f                               155</span>\n\n\nM. Social morality, medical ethicality and State interest:\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_219\">170. Having dwelt upon the issue of self-determination, we\n\nmay presently delve into three aspects, namely, social\n\nmorality, medical ethicality and the State interest. The\n\naforesaid concepts have to be addressed in the constitutional\n\nbackdrop. We may clearly note that the society at large may\n\nfeel that a patient should be treated till he breathes his last\n\nbreath and the treating physicians may feel that they are\n\nbound by their Hippocratic oath which requires them to\n\nprovide treatment and save life and not to put an end to life by\n\nnot treating the patient.    The members of the family may\n\nremain in a constant state of hesitation being apprehensive of\n\nmany a social factor which include immediate claim of\n\ninheritance, social stigma and, sometimes, the individual guilt.\n\nThe Hippocratic oath taken by a doctor may make him feel\n\nthat there has been a failure on his part and sometimes also\n\nmake him feel scared of various laws. There can be allegations\n\nagainst him for negligence or criminal culpability.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_220\">171. In this regard, two aspects are to be borne in mind.\n\nFirst, withdrawal of treatment in an irreversible situation is\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_295\">\f                               156</span>\n\n\ndifferent from not treating or attending to a patient and\n\nsecond, once passive euthanasia is recognized in law regard\n\nbeing had to the right to die with dignity when life is ebbing\n\nout and when the prolongation is done sans purpose, neither\n\nthe social morality nor the doctors‘ dilemma or fear will have\n\nany place. It is because the sustenance of dignity and self-\n\nrespect of an individual is inhered in the right of an individual\n\npertaining to life and liberty and there is necessity for this\n\nprotection. And once the said right comes within the shelter of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_181\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution, the social perception and the\n\napprehension of the physician or treating doctor regarding\n\nfacing litigation should be treated as secondary because the\n\nprimacy of the right of an individual in this regard has to be\n\nkept on a high pedestal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_221\">172. It is to be borne in mind that passive euthanasia\n\nfundamentally connotes absence of any overt act either by the\n\npatient or by the doctors. It also does not involve any kind of\n\novert act on the part of the family members. It is avoidance of\n\nunnecessary intrusion in the physical frame of a person, for\n\nthe inaction is meant for smooth exit from life. It is paramount\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_296\">\f                                157</span>\n\n\nfor an individual to protect his dignity as an inseparable part\n\nof the right to life which engulfs the dignified process of dying\n\nsans pain, sans suffering and, most importantly, sans\n\nindignity.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_222\">173. There are philosophers, thinkers and also scientists who\n\nfeel that life is not confined to the physical frame and\n\nbiological characteristics. But there is no denial of the fact that\n\nlife in its connotative expanse intends to search for its\n\nmeaning and find the solution of the riddle of existence for\n\nwhich some lean on atheism and some vouchsafe for faith and\n\nyet some stand by the ideas of an agnostic. However, the legal\n\nfulcrum has to be how <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_182\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution is\n\nunderstood. If a man is allowed to or, for that matter, forced to\n\nundergo pain, suffering and state of indignity because of\n\nunwarranted medical support, the meaning of dignity is lost\n\nand the search for meaning of life is in vain.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_223\">N.   Submissions of the States\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_224\">174. In this context, we may reflect on the submissions\n\nadvanced on behalf of certain States. As stated earlier, there\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_297\">\f                              158</span>\n\n\nis a categorical assertion that protection of human life is\n\nparamount and it is obligatory on behalf of the States to\n\nprovide treatment and to see that no one dies because of lack\n\nof treatment and to realise the principles enshrined in Chapter\n\nIV of the Constitution. Emphasis has been laid on the State\n\ninterest and the process of abuse that can take place in\n\ntreating passive euthanasia as permissible in law.          To\n\neliminate the possibility of abuse, safeguards can be taken\n\nand guidelines can be framed. But on the plea of possibility of\n\nabuse, the dignity in the process of dying being a facet of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_183\">Article 21</a> should not be curbed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_225\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_226\">     Mr. Datar, learned senior counsel in the course of\n\narguments, has advanced submissions in support of passive\n\neuthanasia and also given suggestions       spelling out   the\n\nguidelines for advance directive and also implementation of\n\nthe same when the patient is hospitalized.    The said aspect\n\nshall be taken into consideration while giving effect to the\n\nadvance directive and also taking steps for withdrawal of\n\nmedical support.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_298\">\f                              159</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_227\">\n\n\nO. Submissions of Intervenor (Society for the Right to\nDie with Dignity):\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_228\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_229\">175. Mr. Mohta, learned counsel appearing for the intervenor,\n\nthat is, Society for the Right to Die with Dignity, has drawn\n\nour attention to certain articles and submitted that from the\n\ndays of Plato to the time of Sir Thomas More and other\n\nthinkers, painless and peaceful death has been advocated. He\n\nwould also submit that ancient wisdom of India taught people\n\nnot to fear death but to aspire for deathlessness and conceive\n\nit as ―Mahaprasthana‖. It is his submission that in the modern\n\nState, the State interest should not over-weigh the individual\n\ninterest in the sphere of a desire to die a peaceful death which\n\nbasically conveys refusal of treatment when the condition of\n\nthe individual suffering from a disease is irreversible. The\n\nfreedom of choice in this sphere, as Mr. Mohta would put it,\n\nserves the cause of humanitarian approach which is not the\n\nprocess to put an end to life by taking a positive action but to\n\nallow a dying patient to die peaceably instead of prolonging the\n\nprocess of dying without purpose that creates a dent in his\n\ndignity.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_299\">\f                                160</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_230\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_231\">176. The aforesaid argument, we have no hesitation to say,\n\nhas force. It is so because it is in accord with the\n\nconstitutional precept and fosters the cherished value of\n\ndignity of an individual. It saves a helpless person from\n\nuncalled for and unnecessary treatment when he is considered\n\nas merely a creature whose breath is felt or measured because\n\nof advanced medical technology. His ―being‖ exclusively rests\n\non the mercy of the technology which can prolong the\n\ncondition for some period. The said prolongation is definitely\n\nnot in his interest. On the contrary, it tantamounts to\n\ndestruction of his dignity which is the core value of life. In our\n\nconsidered opinion, in such a situation, an individual interest\n\nhas to be given priority over the State interest.\n\n\nP.  Advance Directive/Advance Care Directive/Advance\nMedical Directive:\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_232\">177. In order to overcome the difficulty faced in case of\n\npatients who are unable to express their wishes at the time of\n\ntaking the decision, the concept of Advance Medical Directives\n\nemerged in various countries. The proponents of Advance\n\nMedical Directives contend that the concept of patient\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_300\">\f                              161</span>\n\n\nautonomy for incompetent patients can be given effect to, by\n\ngiving room to new methods by which incompetent patients\n\ncan beforehand communicate their choices which are made\n\nwhile they are competent. Further, it may be argued that\n\nfailure to recognize Advance Medical Directives would amount\n\nto non-facilitation of the right to have a smoothened dying\n\nprocess. That apart, it accepts the position that a competent\n\nperson can express her/his choice to refuse treatment at the\n\ntime when the decision is required to be made.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_233\">178. Advance Directives for health care go by various names\n\nin different countries though the objective by and large is the\n\nsame, that is, to specify an individual&#x27;s health care decisions\n\nand to identify persons who will take those decisions for the\n\nsaid individual in the event he is unable to communicate his\n\nwishes to the doctor.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_234\">179. The Black&#x27;s Law Dictionary defines an advance medical\n\ndirective as, &quot;a legal document explaining one&#x27;s wishes about\n\nmedical treatment if one becomes incompetent or unable to\n\ncommunicate‖. A living will, on the other hand, is a document\n\nprescribing a person&#x27;s wishes regarding the medical treatment\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_301\">\f                                 162</span>\n\n\nthe person would want if he was unable to share his wishes\n\nwith the health care provider.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_235\">180. Another type of advance medical directive is medical\n\npower of attorney. It is a document which allows an individual\n\n(principal) to appoint a trusted person (agent) to take health\n\ncare decisions when the principal is not able to take such\n\ndecisions. The agent appointed to deal with such issues can\n\ninterpret the principal&#x27;s decisions based on their mutual\n\nknowledge and understanding.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_236\">181. Advance Directives have gained lawful recognition in\n\nseveral jurisdictions by way of legislation and in certain\n\ncountries through judicial pronouncements. In vast majority of\n\nthe States in USA, it is mandatory for the doctors to give effect\n\nto the wishes of the patients as declared by them in their\n\nadvance directives. California was the first State to legally\n\nsanction living will. The United States Congress in 1990, with\n\nthe objective of protecting the fundamental principles of self-\n\nautonomy and self-determination, enacted the Patient Self-\n\nDetermination Act (PSDA) which acknowledged the rights of\n\nthe patient to either refuse or accept treatment. Following this,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_302\">\f                               163</span>\n\n\nall 50 States enacted legislations adopting advance directives.\n\nApart from this, several States of USA also permit the patients\n\nto appoint a health care proxy which becomes effective only\n\nwhen the patient is unable to make decisions.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_237\">182. In order to deal with the technicalities and intricacies\n\nassociated with an instrument as complex as an Advance\n\nDirective, several derivatives/versions have evolved over time.\n\nThe National Right to Life Committee (NRLC) in the United\n\nStates came up with a version of a living will which was called\n\n&#x27;Will to Live&quot; which is a safeguard of the lives of patients who\n\nwish to continue treatment and not refuse life-sustaining\n\ntreatment. This form of active declaration gains importance in\n\ncases where the will of the patient cannot be deciphered with\n\ncertainty and the Courts order withdrawal of life supporting\n\ntreatment where they deem the life of the patient as not\n\nworthwhile.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_238\">183. Yet another measure for finding and accessing the\n\npatient&#x27;s advance directive was the setting up of the U.S.\n\nLiving Will Registry. As per this model, it was obligatory on the\n\npart of the hospital administration to ask a patient, who would\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_303\">\f                              164</span>\n\n\nbe admitted, if he/she had an advance directive and store the\n\nsame on their medical file.   A special power to the Advance\n\nDirectives introduced by Virginia was the &quot;Ulysses Clause&quot;\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_147\">which accords protection in situations when the patient goes\n\ninto relapse in his/her condition, that is, schizophrenia and\n\nrefuses treatment which they would not refuse if not for the\n\nsaid relapse.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_239\">184. A new type of advance directive is the &quot;Do Not\n\nResuscitate Order&quot; (DNRO) in Florida which is a form of\n\npatient identification device developed by the Department of\n\nHealth to identify people who do not wish to be resuscitated in\n\nthe event of respiratory or cardiac arrest. In Florida State of\n\nUnited States, where an unconscious patient with the phrase\n\n&quot;Do Not Resuscitate&quot; tattooed on his chest was brought in\n\nparamedics, the doctors were left in a conundrum whether the\n\nmessage was not to provide any medical treatment to the\n\npatient and ultimately, the doctors opted not to perform any\n\nmedical procedure and the patient, thereafter, died. This case\n\nhighlights the dynamics involved in the concept of advanced\n\ndirectives due to the intricacies surrounding the concept.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_304\">\f                                165</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_240\">185. The Mental Capacity Act governs the law relating to\n\nadvance directives in the UK. Specific guidelines as to the\n\nmanner in which the advance directive should be drafted and\n\nthe necessary conditions that need to be fulfilled in order to\n\ngive effect to the directives have been categorically laid out in\n\nthe said piece of legislation. A few specific requirements in\n\ncase of refusal of life sustaining treatment is the verification of\n\nthe decision-maker that the refusal operates even if life is at\n\nrisk and that the directive should be in the written form and\n\nsigned and witnessed. However, an advance directive refusing\n\nfood and water has not been recognized under this statute.\n\n<a href=\"/doc/262262/\" id=\"a_184\">Further, the Act</a> recognizes the rights of the patient to appoint\n\na health care proxy who is referred to as &quot;lasting power of\n\nattorney&quot;. In order for the proxy decision-maker so appointed\n\nto be competent to consent or refuse life-sustaining treatment\n\nof the decision-maker, an express provision delegating the said\n\nauthority should be a part of the advance directive. In general,\n\nas per the settled law vide the decision in Airedale, life\n\nsustaining   treatment    including    artificial   nutrition   and\n\nhydration can be withdrawn if the patient consents to it and in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_305\">\f                                166</span>\n\n\ncase of incompetent patients, if it is in their best interest to do\n\nso.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_241\">186. Australia too, by way of legislation, has well established\n\nprinciples    governing   Advance     Health     Directives.    Except\n\nTasmania, all states have a provision for Advance Directives.\n\nThe   Advance     Directives   as   postulated     by   the    different\n\nlegislations in each State in Australia differ in nature and their\n\nbinding effect but the objective of every type remains the same,\n\nthat is, preservation of the patient&#x27;s autonomy. There are\n\nseveral circumstances when the advance health care directives\n\nor certain provisions contained therein become inoperative.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_242\">187. In      Queensland, the directive becomes inoperative if the\n\nmedical health practitioner is of the opinion that giving effect\n\nto the directive is inconsistent with good medical practice or in\n\ncase of a change in circumstances, including new advances in\n\nmedicine, medical practice and technology, to the extent that\n\ngiving effect to the directive is inappropriate.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_243\">188. In the State of Victoria, an advance directive ceases to\n\napply due to a change in the condition of the patient to the\n\nextent that the condition in relation to which the advance\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_306\">\f                              167</span>\n\n\ndirective was given no longer exists. Further, South Australia\n\npermits a medical practitioner to refuse to comply with a\n\ncertain provision in an advance directive in case he/she has\n\nenough reason to believe that the patient did not intend the\n\nprovision to apply in certain conditions or the provision would\n\nnot reflect the present wishes of the patient. In Western\n\nAustralia, the occurrence of a change in circumstances which\n\neither the decision maker could have never anticipated at the\n\ntime of making the directive or which could have the effect on\n\na reasonable person in the position of the decision maker to\n\nchange his/her mind regarding the treatment decision would\n\ninvalidate the said treatment decision in the directive. In\n\nNorthern   Territory,   an   advance   consent   direction   is\n\ndisregarded in case giving effect to it would result in such\n\nunacceptable pain and suffering to the patient or would be so\n\nunjustifiable and rather it is more reasonable to override the\n\nwishes of the patient. Furthermore, if the medical practitioner\n\nis of the opinion that the patient would have never intended\n\nthe advance consent direction to apply in the circumstances,\n\nthen the advance consent direction need not be complied with.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_307\">\f                                168</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_244\">189. Canada does not have a federal legislation exclusively to\n\nregulate advance directives. Rather, there are eleven different\n\nprovincial    approaches    governing     the   law      on    passive\n\neuthanasia and advance directives in Canada. The provinces\n\nof Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Prince Edward Island,\n\nNewfoundland and Labrador and Northwest Territories have a\n\nprovision for both proxy and instructional directives, whereas,\n\nthe States of British Columbia, Ontario, Quebec and Yukon\n\nprovide only for appointment of a proxy while simultaneously\n\nrecognizing     the   binding    nature    of   previously         given\n\ninstructions.     The      respective     legislations        of    the\n\nprovinces/territories differ from one another on several\n\ncriteria, for instance, minimum age requirement and other\n\nformalities to be complied with, such as written nature of the\n\nadvance directive, etc. Furthermore, some of the provinces\n\nmandate a prior consultation with a lawyer.           Wishes orally\n\nexpressed have also been recognized by some provinces.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_245\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"235821\" id=\"span_308\">190. Having dealt with the principles in vogue across the\n\nglobe, we may presently proceed to deal with the issue of\n\nadvance medical directive which should be ideal in our\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_309\">\f                                169</span>\n\n\ncountry. Be it noted, though the learned counsel for the\n\npetitioner has used the words ―living will‖, yet we do not intend\n\nto use the said terminology. We have already stated that\n\nsafeguards and guidelines are required to be provided. First,\n\nwe shall analyse the issue of legal permissibility of the advance\n\nmedical directive. In other jurisdictions, the concepts of ―living\n\nwill‖ and involvement of Attorney are stipulated. There is no\n\nlegal framework in our country as regards the Advance\n\nMedical Directive but we are obliged to protect the right of the\n\ncitizens as enshrined under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_185\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. It is\n\nour constitutional obligation. As noticed earlier, the two-Judge\n\nBench    in   <a href=\"/doc/235821/\" id=\"a_186\">Aruna   Shanbaug</a>        (supra)   has   provided   for\n\napproaching the High Court under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_187\">Article 226</a> of the\n\nConstitution.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"235821\" id=\"span_310\">The directions and guidelines to be given in this\n\njudgment would be comprehensive and would also cover the\n\nsituation dealt with <a href=\"/doc/235821/\" id=\"a_188\">Aruna Shanbaug</a> case.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_246\">191. In our considered opinion, Advance Medical Directive\n\nwould serve as a fruitful means to facilitate the fructification of\n\nthe sacrosanct right to life with dignity. The said directive, we\n\nthink, will dispel many a doubt at the relevant time of need\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_311\">\f                                  170</span>\n\n\nduring the course of treatment of the patient. That apart, it\n\nwill strengthen the mind of the treating doctors as they will be\n\nin a position to ensure, after being satisfied, that they are\n\nacting in a lawful manner. We may hasten to add that Advance\n\nMedical Directive cannot operate in abstraction. There has to\n\nbe safeguards. They need to be spelt out.

This Court is required to summon up\n\n         instincts for legality, fairness and reasonableness in order to find\n\n         just solution to the problem. In this process, the Court is duty\n\n         bound to look into the relevant provisions of the Constitution of\n\n         India, particularly those pertaining to the fundamental rights, and\n\n         to discharge the task of expounding those basic human rights\n\n         enshrined in the Chapter relating to Fundamental Rights. The\n\n         issue of euthanasia, with the seminal importance that is attached\n\n         to it, has thrown the challenge of exposition, development and\n\n         obligation of the constitutional morality and exhorts the Court to\n\n         play its creative role so that a balanced approach to an otherwise\n\n         thorny and highly debatable subject matter is found.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_285\">2)       The Courts, in dispensation of their judicial duties of deciding\n\n         cases, come across all types of problems which are brought\n\n         before them. These cases may be broadly classified into three\n\n         categories: (i) the easy cases, (ii) the intermediate cases, and (iii)\n\n         the hard cases. Professor Ronald Dworkin2 has argued that each\n\n         legal problem has one lawful solution and even in the hard cases,\n\n         the Judge is never free to choose among alternatives that are all\n\n         inside the bounds of law.                    This may not be entirely correct\n\n2    Dworkin, “Judicial Discretion,” 6 J. of Phil. 624 (1963)\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_343\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 215 of 2005                                        Page 2 of 112</span>\n\f        inasmuch as judicial discretion does exist. This is true, at least, in\n\n        solving ‘hard cases’3. It is found that meaning of certain legal\n\n        norms, when applied with respect to a given system of facts, is so\n\n        simple and clear that their application involves no judicial\n\n        discretion. These are termed as the ‘easy cases’. This may even\n\n        apply to ‘intermediate cases’. These would be those cases where\n\n        both sides appear to have a legitimate legal argument supporting\n\n        their position and a conscious act of interpretation is noted,\n\n        before a Judge can conclude which side is right in law and there\n\n        is only one lawful situation. However, when it comes to the hard\n\n        cases, the Court is faced with number of possibilities, all of which\n\n        appear to be lawful within the context of the system. In these\n\n        cases, judicial discretion exists as the choice is not between\n\n        lawful and unlawful, but between lawful and lawful. A number of\n\n        lawful solutions exist. In this scenario, the Court is supposed to\n\n        ultimately choose that solution which is in larger public interest.\n\n        In other words, there are limitations that find the Court with\n\n        respect to the manner in which it choses among possibilities\n\n        (procedural limitations) and with respect to the considerations it\n\n        takes into account in the choice (substantive limitations). Thus,\n\n        discretion when applied to a cout of justice means sound\n\n\n3   See Aharon Barak: Judicial Discretion, Yale University Press.\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_344\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 215 of 2005                               Page 3 of 112</span>\n\f         discretion guided by law. It must be govered by legal rules. To\n\n         quote Justice Cardozo:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_184\">                    “Given freedom of choice, how shall the choice be\n                    guided? Complete freedom – unfettered and undirected\n                    – there never is. A thousand limitations – the product\n                    some of statute, some of precedent, some of vague\n                    tradition or of an immemorial technique – encompass\n                    and hedge us even when we think of ourselves as\n                    ranging freely and at large. The inscrutable force of\n                    professional opinion presses upon us like the\n                    atmosphere, though we are heedless of its weight.\n                    Narrow at best is any freedom that is allotted to us4\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_185\">3)       Thus, though the judicial discretion is with the Court, the same is\n\n         limited and not absolute. The Court is not entitled to weigh any\n\n         factor as it likes.            It has to act within the framework of the\n\n         limitations, and after they have been exhausted, there is a\n\n         freedom of choice which can also described as ‘sovereign\n\n         prerogative of choice’5. Instant case falls in the category of ‘hard\n\n         cases’ and the Court has endeavoured to make a choice, after\n\n         evaluating all the pros and cons, which in its wisdom is the “just\n\n         result” of the contentious issue.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_186\">4)       Adverting to the Indian precedents in the first instance, we have\n\n         before us two direct judgments of this Court which may throw\n\n         some light on the subject and demonstrate as to how this topic\n\n         has been dealt with so far.

However, the\n\n        reference order declares that Aruna Ramachandra Shanbaug\n\n        has committed a factual error in observing that in Gian Kaur the\n\n        Constitution Bench approved the decision of the House of Lords\n\n        in Airedale N.H.S.

However, it further notes that the decision does not\n\n        arrive at a conclusion for validity of euthanasia, be it active or\n\n        passive. Therefore, the only judgment that holds the field in India\n\n        is Aruna Ramachandra Shanbaug, which upholds the validity of\n\n        passive euthanasia and lays down an elaborate procedure for\n\n        executing the same on ‘the wrong premise that the Constitution\n\n        Bench in Gian Kaur had upheld the same’.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_290\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_291\">6)     The aforesaid discussion contained in the reference order\n\n        prompted the reference court to refer the matter to the\n\n        Constitution Bench.

Therefore, in this\n\n        ‘addendum’, I would be focusing myself to the core issues.\n\n\nEUTHANASIA DEFINED\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_307\">12)    The Oxford English Dictionary defines ‘euthanasia’ as ‘the\n\n        painless killing of a patient suffering from an incurable and painful\n\n        disease or in an irreversible coma’. The word appears to have\n\n        come into usage in the early 17 th century and was used in the\n\n        sense of ‘easy death’.             The term is derived from the Greek\n\n        ‘euthanatos’, with ‘eu’ meaning well, and ‘thanatos’ meaning\n\n        death. In ancient Greece and Rome, citizens were entitled to a\n\n        good death to end the suffering of a terminal illness. To that end,\n\n        the City Magistrates of Athens kept a supply of poison to help the\n\n        dying ‘drink the hemlock’10.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_308\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_309\">13)    The above Greek definition of euthanasia apart, it is a loaded\n\n        term. People have been grappling with it for ages. Devised for\n\n        service in a rhetoric of persuasion, the term ‘euthanasia’ has no\n\n        generally accepted and philosophically warranted core meaning.\n\n        It is also defined as: killing at the request of the person killed.\n\n        That is how the Dutch medical personnel and civil authorities\n\n        define euthanasia. In Nazi discourse, euthanasia was any killing\n\n        carried out by medical means or medically qualified personnel,\n10     Michael Manning, Euthanasia and Physician-Assisted Suicide (Paulist Press, 1998).\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_354\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 215 of 2005                                            Page 11 of 112</span>\n\f        whether intended for the termination of suffering and/or of the\n\n        burden or indignity of a life not worth living (Lebensunwertes\n\n        Leben), or for some more evidently public benefit such as\n\n        eugenics (racial purity and hygiene), Lebensraum (living space\n\n        for Germans), and/or minimizing the waste of resources on\n\n        ‘useless       mouths’.         Understandably,   in   today’s       modern\n\n        democracies these Nazi ideas and practices cannot be\n\n        countenanced.           Racist eugenics are condemned, though one\n\n        comes across discreet allusions to the burden and futility of\n\n        sustaining the severely mentally handicapped.              The popular\n\n        conception which is widely accepted is that some sorts of life are\n\n        not worth living; life in such a state demeans the patient’s dignity,\n\n        and maintaining it (otherwise than at the patient’s express\n\n        request) insults that dignity; proper respect for the patient and the\n\n        patient’s best interests requires that that life be brought to an end.\n\n        In this thought process, the basic Greek ideology that it signifies\n\n        ‘an easy and gentle death’ still remains valid. Recognition is to\n\n        the Human Rights principle that ‘right to life’ encompasses ‘right\n\n        to die with dignity’.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_310\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_311\">14)    In common parlance, euthanasia can be of three types, namely,\n\n        ‘voluntary euthanasia’ which means killing at the request of a\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_355\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 215 of 2005                                    Page 12 of 112</span>\n\f        person killed which is to be distinguished from ‘non-voluntary\n\n        euthanasia’, where the person killed is not capable of either\n\n        making or refusing to make such a request.                       Second type of\n\n        euthanasia would be involuntary euthanasia where the person\n\n        killed is capable of making such a request but has not done so 11.\n\n        These terms can be described as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_197\">        (i)    Voluntary Euthanasia: People concerned to legalize the\n\n        termination of life on medical grounds have always concentrated\n\n        on Voluntary Euthanasia (this implies that the patient specifically\n\n        requests that his life be ended.) It is generally agreed that the\n\n        request must come from someone who is either; (a) in intolerable\n\n        pain or (b) who is suffering from an illness which is agreed as\n\n        being terminal. It may be prior to the development of the illness\n\n        in question or during its course. In either case it must not result\n\n        from any pressure from relatives or those who have the patients\n\n        in their care. Both active and passive euthanasia can be termed\n\n        as forms of voluntary euthanasia.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_198\">        (ii)   Non-Voluntary Euthanasia: Seen by some as sub-variety of\n\n        voluntary euthanasia. This involves the death, ostensibly for his\n\n        own good, of someone who cannot express any views on the\n\n        matter and who must, therefore, use some sort of proxy request\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_312\">11 These definitions of voluntary, non-voluntary and involuntary euthanasia correspond to those\n   employed by the House of Lords Select Committee on Medical Ethics (Walton Committee)\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_356\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 215 of 2005                                           Page 13 of 112</span>\n\f        that his/her life be ended. This form of Euthanasia is that which\n\n        most intimately concerns the medical profession. Selective non-\n\n        treatment of the new-born or the doctor may be presented with\n\n        demented and otherwise senilely incompetent patients.                           In\n\n        practice, non-voluntary euthanasia presents only as an arguable\n\n        alternative to non treatment.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_313\">        (iii)   Involuntary Euthanasia: It involves ending the patient’s life\n\n        in the absence of either a personal or proxy invitation to do so.\n\n        The motive ‘The relief of suffering’ may be the same as voluntary\n\n        euthanasia-but its only justification - “a paternalistic decision as to\n\n        what is best for the victim of the disease.” In extreme cases it\n\n        could be against the patient’s wishes or could be just for social\n\n        convenience. It is examples of the latter which serve as warnings\n\n        as to those who would invest the medical professional with more\n\n        or unfettered powers over life and death 12.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_314\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_315\">15)    Contrary to the above, in legal parlance, euthanasia has since\n\n        come to be recognised as of two distinct types: the first is active\n\n        euthanasia, where death is caused by the administration of a\n\n        lethal injection or drugs.            Active euthanasia also includes\n\n        physician-assisted suicide, where the injection or drugs are\n\n        supplied by the physician, but the act of administration is\n12 See Euthanasia and Its Legality and Legitimacy from Indian and International Human Right\n   Instruments Perspectives published in Human Rights &amp; Social Justice by Muzafer Assadi\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_357\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 215 of 2005                                        Page 14 of 112</span>\n\f        undertaken by the patient himself.      Active euthanasia is not\n\n        permissible in most countries.    The jurisdictions in which it is\n\n        permissible are Canada, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the\n\n        States of Colorado, Vermont, Montana, California, Oregon and\n\n        Washington DC in the United States of America.             Passive\n\n        euthanasia occurs when medical practitioners do not provide life-\n\n        sustaining treatment (i.e. treatment necessary to keep a patient\n\n        alive) or remove patients from life sustaining treatment.       This\n\n        could include disconnecting life support machines or feeding\n\n        tubes or not carrying out life saving operations or providing life\n\n        extending drugs. In such cases, the omission by the medical\n\n        practitioner is not treated as the cause of death; instead, the\n\n        patient is understood to have died because of his underlying\n\n        condition.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_316\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_317\">16)    In Aruna Ramachandra Shanbaug, the Court recognised these\n\n        two types of euthanasia i.e. active and passive. It also noted that\n\n        active euthanasia is impermissible, which was so held by the\n\n        Constitution Bench in Gian Kaur. Therefore, without going into\n\n        further debate on differential that is assigned to the term\n\n        euthanasia, ethically, philosophically, medically etc., we would be\n\n        confining ourselves to the aforesaid legal meaning assigned to\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_358\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 215 of 2005                           Page 15 of 112</span>\n\f        active and passive euthanasia.                  Thus, insofar as active\n\n        euthanasia is concerned, this has to be treated as legally\n\n        impermissible, at least for the time being. It is more so, as there\n\n        is absence of any statutory law permitting active euthanasia. If at\n\n        all, legal provisions in the form of <a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_213\">Sections 306</a> and <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_214\">307</a> IPC etc.\n\n        point towards its criminality.                The discussion henceforth,\n\n        therefore, would confine to passive euthanasia.\n\n\nPASSIVE EUTHANASIA AND ARUNA RAMACHANDRA SHANBAUG\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_318\">17)    In Aruna Ramachandra Shanbaug, a two Judges’ Bench of this\n\n        Court discussed in much greater detail various nuances of\n\n        euthanasia by referring to active and passive euthanasia as well\n\n        as     voluntary        and     involuntary    euthanasia;   legality    and\n\n        permissibility thereof; relationship of euthanasia vis-a-vis offences\n\n        concerned under the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_215\">IPC</a> and doctor assisted death; etc.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_319\">18)    The Court also took note of legislations in some countries relating\n\n        to euthanasia or physician assisted death.                   Thereafter, it\n\n        discussed in detail the judgment in Bland wherein the House of\n\n        Lords had permitted the patient to die.

The wishes of the close\n\n        relatives and next friends and opinion of the medical practitioners\n\n        should be given due weight by the Court in coming to its decision.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_320\">        The Court then noted the position of euthanasia with reference to\n\n        Section 306 (abetment of suicide) and Section 309 (attempt to\n\n        commit suicide) of the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_216\">IPC</a>, inasmuch as, even allowing passive\n\n        euthanasia may come in conflict with the aforesaid provisions\n\n        which make such an act a crime.                 While making a passing\n\n        observation that Section 309 should be deleted by the Parliament\n\n        as it has become anachronistic, the Court went into the vexed\n\n        question as to who can decide whether life support should be\n\n        discontinued in the case of an incompetent person, e.g. a person\n\n        in coma or PVS.             The Court pointed out that it was a vexed\n\n        question, both because of its likely misuse and also because of\n\n        advancement in medical science. It noted:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_201\">                    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"217501\" id=\"span_360\">“104.

This vexed question\n                    has been arising often in India because there are a\n                    large number of cases where persons go into coma\n                    (due to an accident or some other reason) or for some\n                    other reason are unable to give consent, and then the\n                    question arises as to who should give consent for\n                    withdrawal of life support. This is an extremely\n                    important question in India because of the unfortunate\n                    low level of ethical standards to which our society has\n                    descended,        its     raw      and      widespread\n                    commercialisation, and the rampant corruption, and\n                    hence, the Court has to be very cautious that\n                    unscrupulous persons who wish to inherit the property\n                    of someone may not get him eliminated by some\n                    crooked method.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_202\">                    105. Also, since medical science is advancing fast,\n                    doctors must not declare a patient to be a hopeless\n                    case unless there appears to be no reasonable\n                    possibility of any improvement by some newly\n                    discovered medical method in the near future. In this\n                    connection we may refer to a recent news item which\n                    we have come across on the internet of an Arkansas\n                    man Terry Wallis, who was 19 years of age and newly\n                    married with a baby daughter when in 1984 his truck\n                    plunged through a guard rail, falling 25 feet. He went\n                    into coma in the crash in 1984, but after 24 years he\n                    has regained consciousness. This was perhaps\n                    because his brain spontaneously rewired itself by\n                    growing tiny new nerve connections to replace the\n                    ones sheared apart in the car crash. Probably the\n                    nerve fibres from Terry Wallis&#x27; cells were severed but\n                    the cells themselves remained intact, unlike Terri\n                    Schiavo, whose brain cells had died (see Terri\n                    Schiavo case on Google). However, we make it clear\n                    that it is experts like medical practitioners who can\n                    decide whether there is any reasonable possibility of a\n                    new medical discovery which could enable such a\n                    patient to revive in the near future.”\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_203\">20)     It held that passive euthanasia would be permissible when a\n\n        person is ‘dead’ in clinical sense.

The Court\n\n        took note of President’s Committee on Bioethics in the United\n\n        States of America which had come up with a new definition of\n\n        ‘brain death’ in the year 2008, according to which a person was\n\n        considered to be braindead when he could no longer perform the\n\n        fundamental human work of an organism. Three such situations\n\n        contemplated in that definition are the following:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_204\">                    “(1) openness to the world, that is receptivity to stimuli\n                    and signals from the surrounding environment,\n\n                    (2) the ability to act upon the world to obtain\n                    selectively what it needs, and\n\n                    (3) the basic felt need that drives the organism to\n                    act ... to obtain what it needs.”\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_205\">21)    The Court held that when the aforesaid situation is reached, a\n\n        person can be presumed to be dead. In paragraph 115 of the\n\n        judgment, the position is summed up as under:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_206\">                    “When this situation is reached, it is possible to\n                    assume that the person is dead, even though he or\n                    she, through mechanical stimulation, may be able\n                    to breathe, his or her heart might be able to beat,\n                    and he or she may be able to take some form of\n                    nourishment. It is important, thus, that it be\n                    medically proved that a situation where any human\n                    functioning would be impossible should have been\n                    reached for there to be a declaration of brain death\n                    —situations where a person is in a persistent\n                    vegetative state but can support breathing, cardiac\n                    functions, and digestion without any mechanical aid\n                    are necessarily those that will not come within the\n                    ambit of brain death.”\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_363\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 215 of 2005                                   Page 19 of 112</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_207\">\f22)    The Court clarified that brain death was not the same as PVS\n\n        inasmuch as in PVS the brain stem continues to work and so\n\n        some degree of reactions may occur, though the possibility of\n\n        regaining consciousness is relatively remote.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_208\">23)    The Court further opined that position in the case of euthanasia\n\n        would be slightly different and pointed out that the two\n\n        circumstances in which it would be fair to disallow resuscitation of\n\n        a person who is incapable of expressing his or her consent to the\n\n        termination of his or her life.

We agree with Mr\n                    Andhyarujina that passive euthanasia should be\n                    permitted in our country in certain situations, and we\n                    disagree with the learned Attorney General that it\n                    should never be permitted.

It can also be taken by\n                    the doctors attending the patient. However, the\n                    decision should be taken bona fide in the best interest\n                    of the patient.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_323\">                    In the present case, we have already noted that Aruna\n                    Shanbaug&#x27;s parents are dead and other close relatives\n                    are not interested in her ever since she had the\n                    unfortunate assault on her.

Hence it is for the KEM Hospital staff to\n                    take that decision.

All that we wish to say is that however\n                    much her interest in Aruna Shanbaug may be it cannot\n                    match the involvement of the KEM Hospital staff who\n                    have been taking care of Aruna day and night for 38\n                    years.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_326\">                    However, assuming that the KEM Hospital staff        at\n                    some future time changes its mind, in our opinion    in\n                    such a situation KEM Hospital would have to apply    to\n                    the Bombay High Court for approval of the decision   to\n                    withdraw life support.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_327\">                    (ii) Hence, even if a decision is taken by the near\n                    relatives or doctors or next friend to withdraw life\n                    support, such a decision requires approval from the\n                    High Court concerned as <a href=\"/doc/1031794/\" id=\"a_221\">laid down in</a> Airedale case.\n\n                    In our opinion, this is even more necessary in our\n                    country as we cannot rule out the possibility of\n                    mischief being done by relatives or others for\n                    inheriting the property of the patient.”\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_328\">25)    It can be discerned from the reading of the said judgment that\n\n        court was concerned with the question as to whether one can\n\n        seek right to die?

In Gian Kaur this ‘right to die’ had not been accepted as an\n\n        integral part of ‘right to life’. The Court in Aruna Ramachandra\n\n        Shanbaug maintained this position insofar as an active\n\n        euthanasia is concerned. However, passive euthanasia, under\n\n        certain circumstances, has been accepted.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_329\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_330\">26)    It may be pertinent to mention that the petitioner (Aruna) in the\n\n        said case was working as a nurse in the King Edward Memorial\n\n        Hospital (KEM), Parel, Mumbai. The tragic incident happened on\n\n        the evening of 27th November, 1973. Aruna was attacked by a\n\n        sweeper in the hospital who wrapped a dog chain around her\n\n        neck and yanked her back with it. He tried to rape her but on\n\n        finding that she was menstruating, he sodomized her. To\n\n        immobilize her during this act, he twisted the chain around her\n\n        neck. She was found unconscious by one cleaner on the next\n\n        day. Her body was on the floor and blood was all over the floor.\n\n        The incident did not allow oxygen to reach her brain as a result of\n\n        which her brain got damaged.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_331\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_332\">27)    The petition was filed by Ms. Pinki Virani as next friend of Aruna\n\n        Shanbaug.

The team of doctors studied\n\n        her medical history and observed that Aruna would get\n\n        uncomfortable if the room in which she was located was over\n\n        crowded, she was calm when fewer people were around her. In\n\n        fact, the hospital staff had taken care and was willing to continue\n\n        to do so. Moreover, Aruna’s body language did not suggest that\n\n        she wants to die.

This case placed the authority\n\n        to decide whether a case is fit or not for euthanasia in the hands\n\n        of the court. In this case, Aruna did not have the capacity to\n\n        consent for the proposed medical process. Therefore, the next\n\n        big question that was to be answered was who should decide on\n\n        her behalf.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_338\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_339\">30)    Since, there was no relative traced directly, nor did she have any\n\n        frequent visitor who could relate to her, it was extremely crucial\n\n        for the court to declare who should decide on her behalf. As there\n\n        was lack of acquaintance, it was decided by beneficence.\n\n        Beneficence is acting in the interest that is best for the patient,\n\n        and is not influenced by personal convictions, motives or other\n\n        considerations. Public interest and the interests of the state were\n\n        also considered in the said matter.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_340\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_341\">31)    On the aforesaid principle of beneficence and studying the\n\n        position in some other countries, the court in its judgment said,\n\n        the right to take decision on behalf of Aruna was vested with the\n\n        hospital and its management and not Ms. Pinki. The court also\n\n        said that allowing euthanasia would mean reversing the efforts of\n\n        the hospital and its staff. In order to ensure that there is no\n\n        misuse of this technique, the Supreme Court has vested the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_372\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 215 of 2005                           Page 25 of 112</span>\n\f        power with the High Court to decide if life is to be terminated or\n\n        not.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_342\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_343\">32)    Thus, the Supreme Court allowed passive euthanasia in certain\n\n        conditions, subject to the approval by the High Court following the\n\n        due procedure. It held that when an application for passive\n\n        euthanasia is filed the Chief Justice of the High Court should\n\n        forthwith constitute a Bench of at least two Judges who should\n\n        decide to grant approval or not. Before doing so, the Bench\n\n        should seek the opinion of a committee of three reputed doctors\n\n        to be nominated by the Bench after consulting such medical\n\n        authorities/medical             practitioners   as   it   may   deem      fit.\n\n        Simultaneously with appointing the committee of doctors, the\n\n        High Court Bench shall also issue notice to the State and close\n\n        relatives e.g. parents, spouse, brothers/sisters etc. of the\n\n        committee to them as soon as it is available. After hearing them,\n\n        the High Court Bench should give its verdict. The above\n\n        procedure should be followed all over India until Parliament\n\n        makes legislation on this subject.              I am not carrying out the\n\n        critique of this judgment at this stage and the manner in which it\n\n        has been analysed by those who are the proponents of passive\n\n        euthanasia and those who are against it.

Some    of   these\n\n        complexities may be captured at this stage itself.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_346\">34) The legal regime webbed by various judgments rendered by this\n\n        Court would reflect that the Indian position on the subject is\n\n        somewhat complex and even complicated to certain extend.

This Article has been interpreted\n\n        by the Court in most expansive terms, particularly when it comes\n\n        to the meaning that is assigned to ‘right to life’.              It is not\n\n        necessary to take stock of various faces of right to life defined by\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_374\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 215 of 2005                                  Page 27 of 112</span>\n\f        this Court. What is important for our purpose is to point out that\n\n        right to life has been treated as more than ‘mere animal\n\n        existence’. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"619152\" id=\"span_375\">In <a href=\"/doc/619152/\" id=\"a_225\">Kharak Singh v. State of U.P. &amp; Ors.17</a> it was held\n\n        that the word ‘life’ in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_226\">Article 21</a> means right to live with human\n\n        dignity and it does not merely connote continued drudgery. It\n\n        takes within its fold “some of the finer graces of human\n\n        civilisation, which makes life worth living” and that the expanded\n\n        concept of life would mean the “tradition, culture and heritage” of\n\n        the concerned person. This concept has been reiterated and\n\n        reinforced, time and again, in a series of judgments. It may not\n\n        be necessary to refer to those judgments.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"91938676\" id=\"span_376\">Suffice is to mention\n\n        that a nine Judge Constitution Bench of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/91938676/\" id=\"a_227\">K.S.\n\n        Puttaswamy and Another v.

Though Justice Ramaswamy rendered minority opinion\n\n        in that case, on the aforesaid aspect, majority opinion was not\n\n        contrary to the views expressed by Justice Ramaswamy. Thus,\n\n        <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_228\">Article 21</a> recognizes right to live with human dignity 20.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_348\">36) The question that arises at this juncture is as to whether right to\n\n        life enshrined in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_229\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution includes right to die.\n\n        If such a right is recognised, that would provide immediate\n\n        answer to the issue involved, which is pertaining to voluntary or\n\n        passive euthanasia. However, the judgments of this Court, as\n\n        discussed hereinafter, would demonstrate that no straightforward\n\n        answer is discernible and, as observed above, the position\n\n        regarding euthanasia is somewhat complex in the process.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_349\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"513801\" id=\"span_379\">37) It would be interesting to point out that in <a href=\"/doc/513801/\" id=\"a_230\">Rustom Cavasjee\n\n        Cooper v.

This\n\n        Court also made a specific observation that there cannot be\n\n        serious dispute about the proposition that fundamental rights\n\n        have their positive as well as negative aspect.                     For example,\n\n        freedom of speech and expression includes freedom not to\n\n        speak.

In this\n\n        context, can it be said that right to life includes right to die or right\n\n        to terminate ones own life?                   The Constitution Bench in Gian\n\n        Kaur, however, has taken a view that right to live will not include\n\n        right not to live.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_351\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_352\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"490515\" id=\"span_381\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"120603172\" id=\"span_382\">38) We have already pointed out that <a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_231\">Section 306</a> of the IPC makes\n\n        abetment to suicide as a punishable offence.

If that is so, would it not be against medical ethics to let a\n\n        person die by withdrawing medical aid or, even for that matter, life\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_387\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 215 of 2005                                 Page 32 of 112</span>\n\f        supporting instruments. Paradoxically, advancement in medical\n\n        science has compounded the issue further. There has been a\n\n        significant advancement in medical science. Medical scientists\n\n        have been, relentlessly and continuously, experimenting and\n\n        researching to find out better tools for not only curing the disease\n\n        with which human beings suffer from time to time, noble attempt\n\n        is to ensure that human life is prolonged and in the process of\n\n        enhancing the expectancy of life, ailments and sufferings\n\n        therefrom are reduced to the minimal. There is, thus, a fervent\n\n        attempt to impress the quality of life. It is this very advancement\n\n        in the medical science which creates dilemma at that juncture\n\n        when, in common perception, life of a person has virtually\n\n        become unlivable but the medical doctors, bound by their\n\n        Hippocratic Oath, want to still spare efforts in the hope that there\n\n        may still be a chance, even if it is very remote, to bring even such\n\n        a person back to life. The issue, therefore, gets compounded\n\n        having counter forces of medical science, morality and ethical\n\n        values, the very concept of life from philosophical angle. In this\n\n        entire process, as indicated in the beginning and demonstrated in\n\n        detail at the appropriate stage, the vexed question is to be\n\n        ultimately decided taking into consideration the normative law,\n\n        and in particular, the constitutional values.\n</blockquote>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_388\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 215 of 2005                           Page 33 of 112</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_219\">\f41) Then, there is also a possibility of misuse and it becomes a\n\n        challenging task to ensure that passive euthanasia does not\n\n        become a tool of corruption and a convenient mode to ease out\n\n        the life of a person who is considered inconvenient.

It has moral\n\n        and philosophical overtones. It has even religious overtones. As\n\n        Professor Upendra Baxi rightly remarks that judges are, in fact,\n\n        not jurisprudes. At the same time, it is increasingly becoming\n\n        important that some jurisprudential discussion ensues while\n\n        deciding those cases which have such more and philosophical\n\n        overtones as well.              Such an analyses provides not only legal\n\n        basis for the conclusions arrived at but it also provides logical\n\n        commonsense justification as well.              Obviously, whenever the\n\n        court is entering into a new territory and is developing a new legal\n\n        norm, discussion on normative jurisprudence assumes greater\n\n        significance as the court is called upon to decide what the legal\n\n        norm should be. At the same time, this normative jurisprudence\n\n        discourse has to be preceded by analytical jurisprudence, which\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_389\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 215 of 2005                                 Page 34 of 112</span>\n\f        is necessary for the court to underline existing nature of law.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_358\">        That would facilitate knowing legal framework of what is the\n\n        current scenario and, in turn, help in finding the correct answers.\n\n        When we discuss about the philosophical aspects of the subject\n\n        matter, it is the ‘value of life’ which becomes the foremost focus of\n\n        discussion.

Our discussion centres\n\n        around ‘passive euthanasia’. Another aspect which needs to be\n\n        mentioned at this stage is that in the present petition filed by the\n\n        petitioner, the petitioner wants that ‘advance directive’ or ‘living\n\n        will’ should be legally recognised. In this backdrop, two important\n\n        questions arise for considerations, viz.,\n\n         (I)   whether passive euthanasia, voluntary or even, in certain\n\n               circumstances, involuntary, is legally permissible?       If so\n\n               under what circumstances (this question squarely calls for\n\n               answer having regards to the reference order made in the\n\n               instant petition)? and\n\n         (II) whether a ‘living will’ or ‘advance directive’ should be legally\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_390\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 215 of 2005                             Page 35 of 112</span>\n\f               recognised and can be enforced?

Every persons\n\n        wants to lead life with good health and all kinds of happiness. At\n\n        the same time, nobody wants any pain, agony or sufferings when\n\n        his or her life span comes to an end and that person has to meet\n\n        death.      The following opening stanza from a song in a film\n\n        captures this message beautifully:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_226\">                        ररोतत हहए आतत हह सब, हहंसतत हहआ जरो जतएगत\n                         वरो महक़द्दर कत ससकन्दर जतनतमन कहलतएगत\n\n         “Every person in this world comes crying.

It is transitory. It is as fragile as any other\n\n        object.     It is a harsh reality that no human being, or for that\n\n        matter, no living being, can live forever. Every creature who takes\n\n        birth on this planet earth has to die one day. Life has a limited\n\n        shelf age.        In fact, unlike the objects and articles which are\n\n        produced by human beings and may carry almost same life span,\n\n        insofar as humans themselves are concerned, span of life is also\n\n        uncertain. Nobody knows how long he/she will be able to live.\n\n        The gospel truth is that everybody has to die one day,\n\n        notwithstanding the pious wish of a man to live forever 25. As\n\n        Woody Allen said once: ‘I do not want to achieve immortality\n\n        through my work. I want to achieve it through not dying’. At the\n\n        same time, nobody wants to have a tragic end to life. We all want\n\n        to leave the world in a peaceful manner. In this sense, the term\n\n        ‘euthanasia’ which has its origin in Greek language signifies ‘an\n\n        easy and gentle death’.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_375\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_376\">49) According to Charles I.

It is interesting to note that the issue of\n\n        euthanasia was debated in India in 1928. Probably this was the\n\n        first public debate on euthanasia to be reported.                           A Calf in\n\n        Gandhi’s ashram was ailing under great pain. In spite of every\n\n        possible treatment and nursing…the condition of the calf was so\n\n        bad that it could not even change its side or even it could not be\n\n        lifted about in order to prevent pressure ulcers/sores. It could not\n\n        even take nourishment and was tormented by flies. The surgeon\n\n        whose advice was sought in this matter declared the case to be\n\n        past help and past hope. After painful days of hesitation and\n\n        discussions with the managing committee of Goseva Sangh and\n\n        the inmates of the ashram, Gandhi made up his mind to end the\n\n        life of the calf in a painless way as possible.                        There was a\n\n        commotion in orthodox circles and Gandhi critically examined the\n\n        question through his article which appeared in Navajivan (dated\n\n        30-9-1928) and Young India (4-10-1928). Probably this was the\n\n        first   public      debate      on     euthanasia        and      animal/veterinary\n\n        euthanasia and the debate also covered the issue of human\n\n        euthanasia. It is equally interesting to note that Gandhi and his\n\n        critics discussed the issue of ‘painlessly ending the life to end\n\n        suffering’ without using the term ‘euthanasia’. But, he meant the\n26 Charles I.

Further it is more interesting to learn that at various\n\n        instances Gandhiji had touched upon the issues of the present\n\n        day debates on Voluntary euthanasia, Non-voluntary euthanasia,\n\n        Involuntary euthanasia, as well as passive euthanasia, active\n\n        euthanasia, physician-assisted euthanasia and the rejection or\n\n        ‘termination of treatment’. Gandhi advocated the development of\n\n        positive outlook towards life and strived for the humane nursing\n\n        and medical care even when cure was impossible. It was the way\n\n        he analysed Karma and submitted to the will of the God.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_378\">50) Mahatma Gandhi said:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_228\">               “In these circumstances I felt that humanity demanded that\n\n        the agony should be ended by ending life itself. The matter was\n\n        placed before the whole ashram. At the discussion a worthy\n\n        neighbour vehemently opposed the idea of killing even to end\n\n        pain. The ground of his opposition was that one has no right to\n\n        take away life which one cannot create. His argument seemed\n\n        to me to be pointless here. It would have point if the taking of life\n\n        was actuated by self-interest. Finally, in all humility but with the\n\n        clearest of convictions, I got in my presence a doctor kindly to\n\n        administer the calf a quietus by means of a position injection.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_229\">        The whole thing was over in less than two minutes.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_230\">               But the question may very legitimately be put to me: would I\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_398\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 215 of 2005                            Page 42 of 112</span>\n\f        apply the same principle to human beings? Would I like it to be\n\n        applied in my own case? My reply is ‘yes’; the same law holds\n\n        good in both the cases. The law, ‘as with one so with all’, admits\n\n        of no exceptions, or the killing of the calf was wrong and violent.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_231\">        In practice, however, we do not cut short the sufferings of our\n\n        ailing dear ones by death because, as a rule, we have always\n\n        means at our disposal to help them and they have the capacity to\n\n        think and decide for themselves. But supposing that in the case\n\n        of an ailing friend, I am unable to render any aid whatever and\n\n        recovery is out of question and the patient is lying in an\n\n        unconscious state in the throes of agony, then I would not see\n\n        any himsa in putting an end to his suffering by death.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_232\">               Just as a surgeon does not commit himsa but practices the\n\n        purest ahimsa when he wields his knife, one may find it\n\n        necessary, under certain imperative circumstances, to go a step\n\n        further and sever life from the body in the interest of the sufferer.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_233\">        It may be objected that whereas the surgeon performs his\n\n        operation to save the life of the patient, in the other case we do\n\n        just the reverse. But on a deeper analysis it will be found that the\n\n        ultimate object sought to be served in both the cases is the\n\n        same, namely, to relieve the suffering soul within from pain. In\n\n        the one case you do it by severing the diseased portion from the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_399\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 215 of 2005                            Page 43 of 112</span>\n\f        body, in the other you do it by severing from the soul the body\n\n        that has become an instrument of torture to it. In either case it is\n\n        the relief of the soul within from pain that is aimed at, the body\n\n        without the life within being incapable of feeling either pleasure or\n\n        pain.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_234\">                To conclude then, to cause pain or wish ill to or to take the\n\n        life of any living being out of anger or a selfish intent, is himsa.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_235\">        On the other hand, after a calm and clear judgment to kill or\n\n        cause pain to a living being from a pure selfless intent may be\n\n        the purest form of ahimsa.       Each such case must be judged\n\n        individually and on its own merits.

Ethical\n\n        egoism in the context of euthanasia would mean that if a person\n\n        wants or does not want to end his/her life using euthanasia, this\n\n        desire is presumed to be motivated by a need for self benefit, and\n\n        is therefore an ethical action27.

Luckily, we also have the technology\n\n        that allows us to experience a gentle death on our own terms,\n\n        rather than by medically set terms.            In his famous essay on\n\n        Liberty, John Stuart Mill argues strongly for our right to self-\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_379\">        determination.

At the point of dying, a Buddhist should ideally be\n\n        conscious, rational and alert.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_240\">               Traditional Hindu religious culture also emphasizes the\n\n        good death as a reflection of the quality of life that preceded it. If\n\n        a good, dignified death is attained, it is perceived as evidence of\n\n        having lived a worthy life because “the manner of one’s passing\n\n        out-weighs all previous claims and intimations of one’s moral\n\n        worth”28.\n</blockquote>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_403\">28</span>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_241\">     T N Madan, “Dying with Dignity” (1992) 35 (4) Social Science and Medicine 425–32.\n</blockquote>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_404\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 215 of 2005                                               Page 46 of 112</span>\n<pre id=\"pre_4\">\f              “a good death certifies a good life”29.\n\n              The good death is achieved when death occurs in full\n\n</pre><blockquote id=\"blockquote_242\">        consciousness, in a chosen place and at a chosen time; and\n\n              As with Buddhism great significance is attached to the\n\n        element of choice and the maintenance of control, 30 so if at all\n\n        possible, “one must be in command and should not be overtaken\n\n        by death.

Choosing to deliberately end\n\n        one’s life allows control over the time, place and method of one’s\n\n        dying and explains why euthanasia appears to offer death with\n\n        dignity.

On the one hand, it is an accepted\n\n        belief that every human being wants to die peacefully. Nobody\n\n        wants to undergo any kind of suffering in his last days. So much\n\n        so a person who meets his destiny by sudden death or easy\n\n        death is often considered as a person who would have lived his\n\n        life by practicing moral and ethical values.

However, it does not happen to most of the people.\n\n        Ageing is a natural phenomena. No doubt, as the person\n\n        advances in age, he becomes mature in his wisdom. However,\n\n        old age brings, along with it, various ailments and diseases as\n\n        well. Physical health and physical functioning declines over the\n\n        life course, particularly, in later life. A rise in chronic disease and\n\n        other conditions such as arthritis, high blood pressure and obesity\n\n        can cause loss in function and lead to generally decreasing\n\n        trajectory for health over the lifespan. Thus, ageing has both\n\n        positive and negative aspects. This ageing leads to extinction of\n\n        human life which may generally be preceded by grave sickness\n\n        and disease.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_389\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_390\">60) Horace, Roman poet in his poem on the ‘Ages of Man’ wrote\n\n        quiet scathingly of the attributes of old age:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_250\">                   “Many ills encompass an old man, whether because he\n                   seeks, gain, and then miserably holds aloof from His\n                   store and fears to use it, because, in all that he does, he\n                   lacks fire and courage, is dilatory and slow to form\n                   hopes, is sluggish and greedy of a longer life, peevish,\n                   surly, given to praising the days he spent as a boy, and\n                   to reproving and condemning the young.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_251\">                                                    (Ars Poetica, pp.169-74)\n\n                   We find a more contemporary echo of this in William\n                   Shakespeare’s (1564-1616) famous verse ‘All the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_408\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 215 of 2005                                   Page 50 of 112</span>\n\f                   World’s a Stage’:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_252\">                   all the word’s stage, and all the men and women merely\n                   players;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_253\">                   they have their exits and their entrances,\n                   and one man in his time plays many parts,\n                   his acts being seven ages....Last scene of all,\n                   that ends this strange eventful history,\n                   is second childishness and mere oblivion,\n                   sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_254\">                                           (As You Like It, Act II, scene VII)”\n\n\n               It may, however, be added (for the sake of clarification) that\n\n        advent of disease is not the confines of old age only.

On the one hand, it is argued by those who\n\n        are the proponents of a liberal view that a right to life must\n\n        include a concomitant right to choose when the life becomes\n\n        unbearable and not so worth living, when such a stage comes\n\n        and the sufferer feels that that the life has become useless, he\n\n        should have right to die. Opponents, on the other hand, project\n\n        ‘Sanctity of Life’ (SOL) as the most important factor and argue\n\n        that this ‘SOL’ principle is violated by self-styled angles of death.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_391\">        Protagonists on ‘SOL’ principle believe that life should be\n\n        preserved at all costs and the least which is expected is that\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_409\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 215 of 2005                                    Page 51 of 112</span>\n\f        there should not be a deliberate destruction of human life, though\n\n        it does not demand that life should always be prolonged as long\n\n        as possible.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_392\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_393\">62) It might therefore be argued, as Emily Jackson (2008) cogently\n\n        does, that the law’s recognition that withdrawal of life-prolonging\n\n        treatment is sometimes legitimate is not so much an exception to\n\n        the SOL principle, as an embodiment of it.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_394\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_395\">63) In the most secular judicial interpretation of the SOL doctrine yet,\n\n        Denman J of the UKHL explicated thus:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_256\">                   “in respect a person’s death, we are also respecting their\n                   life – giving it sanctity...A view that life must be preserved\n                   at all costs does not sanctify life.,..to care for the dying,\n                   to love and cherish them, and to free them from suffering\n                   rather than simply to postpone death is to have\n                   fundamental respect for the sanctity of life and its end.”\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_257\">64) Hence, as the process of dying is an inevitable consequence of\n\n        life, the right to life necessarily implies the right to have nature\n\n        take its course and to die a natural death. It also encompasses a\n\n        right, unless the individual so wishes, not to have life artificially\n\n        maintained by the provision of nourishment by abnormal artificial\n\n        means which have no curative effect and which are intended\n\n        merely to prolong life.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_258\">65) A moral paradox which emerges is beautifully described by\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_410\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 215 of 2005                                     Page 52 of 112</span>\n\f        Sushila Rao34, in the following words:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_259\">                   “Several commentators have justified the active/passive\n                   distinction by averring that there is an important moral\n                   difference between killing a patient by administering, say,\n                   a lethal injection, and withdrawing treatment which is\n                   currently keeping her alive. Active euthanasia, runs the\n                   argument, interferes with nature’s dominion, whereas\n                   withdrawal of treatment restores to nature her dominion.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_260\">                   Here too, an absolutist version of the SOL principle rears\n                   its unseemly head. In a plethora of cases in the UK, a\n                   course of action which would lead to the patient’s action\n                   which would lead to the patient’s death was held to be\n                   compatible with the “best interests” test. Indeed, a\n                   majority in the House of Lords in Bland explicitly\n                   accepted that the doctor’s intention in withdrawing\n                   artificial nutrition and hydration was, in Lord Browne-\n                   Wilkinson’s words, to “bring about the death of Anthony\n                   Bland”. Lord Lowry said that “the intention to bring about\n                   the patient’s death is there” and Lord Mustill admitted\n                   that “the proposed conduct has the aim.. of terminating\n                   the life of Anthony Bland”. I each case, however, life\n                   could be brought to an end only because the doctors\n                   had recourse to a course of action which could plausibly\n                   be described as a “failure to prolong life”.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_261\">                   The SOL principle thus works insidiously to ensure that\n                   only certain types of death—namely, those achieved by\n                   suffocation, dehydration, starvation and infection,\n                   through the withdrawal or withholding of, respectively,\n                   ventilation, ratification nutrition and hydration, and\n                   antibiotics-can lawfully be brought about. More crucially,\n                   the SOL principle prohibits doctors from acting to\n                   achieve that end quickly, and more humanly, by the\n                   administration of a single lethal injection.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_262\">                   Lord Browne-Wilkinson lamented this paradox in Bland\n                   in the following words:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_263\">                   “How can it be lawful to allow a patient to die slowly,\n                   though painlessly, over a period of weeks from lack of\n                   food but unlawful to produce his immediate death by a\n                   lethal injection, thereby saving his family from yet\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_411\">34</span>\n     Sushila Rao : Economic and Political Weekly, Vol. 46, No. 18 (April 30-May 6, 2011), pp. 13-16\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_412\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 215 of 2005                                                Page 53 of 112</span>\n\f                   another ordeal to add to the tragedy that has already\n                   struck them?

Therefore, there may be a possibility that a person\n\n        may choose euthanasia but not as a free choice and it would be\n\n        morally wrong.           In a situation where that person is not in a\n\n        position to make a choice (for e.g. when he is in comma) this\n\n        choice shall be exercised by others which, according to him,\n\n        violates the autonomy of the person involved.

Whereas\n\n        euthanasia is morally impermissible in the estimation of some,\n\n        others treat it as perfectly justified.

Opposition to euthanasia,\n\n        on moral grounds, proceeds primarily on the basis that neither the\n\n        concerned person has a right to take his own life, which is God’s\n\n        creation, nor anybody else has this right.

It also does not take into\n\n        consideration permissibility of passive euthanasia under certain\n\n        specific circumstances.

Later, it was\n\n        also influenced by the views of philosophers who developed\n\n        human dignity in their contemplations38. Jurisprudentially, three\n\n        types of models for determining the content of the constitutional\n\n        value of human dignity are recognised. These are: (i) Theological\n\n        Model, (ii)      Philosophical Model, and (iii) Constitutional Model.\n\n        Legal scholars were called upon to determine the theological\n\n        basis of human dignity as a constitutional value and as a\n\n        constitutional right. Philosophers also came out with their views\n\n        justifying      human           dignity   as    core      human        value.

Kant&#x27;s moral theory is divided into two\n\n        parts: ethics and right (jurisprudence). The discussion of human\n\n        dignity took place within his doctrine of ethics and does not\n\n        appear in his jurisprudence42. Kant&#x27;s jurisprudence features the\n\n        concept of a person&#x27;s right to freedom as a human being.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_411\">80) According to Kant, a person acts ethically when he acts by force\n\n        of a duty that a rational agent self-legislates onto his own will.\n\n        This self-legislated duty is not accompanied by any right or\n\n        coercion, and is not correlative to the rights of others. For Kant,\n40 Based on the approach of Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274) in his work Summa Theologia\n41 See Toman E.

This ability is\n\n        the human dignity of man. This is what makes a person different\n\n        than an object.

The almost\n\n        contemporaneous Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948)\n\n        echoed same sentiments.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_420\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_421\">86) <a href=\"/doc/1659104/\" id=\"a_252\">Article 3</a> of the Geneva Conventions explicitly prohibits “outrages\n\n        upon personal dignity”.

And some philosophers say the same thing. Even if this\n\n        is not a connection between dignity and law as such, it certainly\n\n        purports to identify a wholesale connection between dignity and\n\n        the branch of law devoted to human rights. One of the key facets\n\n        of twenty-first century democracies is the primary importance\n\n        they give to the protection of human rights.               From this\n\n        perspective, dignity is the expression of a basic value accepted in\n\n        a broad sense by all people, and thus constitutes the first\n\n        cornerstone in the edifice of human rights. Therefore, there is a\n\n        certain fundamental value to the notion of human dignity, which\n\n        some would consider a pivotal right deeply rooted in any notion of\n\n        justice, fairness, and a society based on basic rights.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_422\">87) Aharon Barak, former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of\n\n        Israel, attributes two roles to the concept of human dignity as a\n\n        constitutional value, which are:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_283\">        1.

Moreover, human dignity as a constitutional\n\n        value also influences the development of the common law.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_423\">88) Within two years of the adoption of the aforesaid Universal\n\n        Declaration of Human Rights that all human beings are born free\n\n        and equal in dignity and rights, India attained independence and\n\n        immediately thereafter Members of the Constituent Assembly\n\n        took up the task of framing the Constitution of this Country. It was\n\n        but natural to include a Bill of Rights in the Indian Constitution\n\n        and the Constitution Makers did so by incorporating a Chapter on\n\n        Fundamental Rights in Part III of the Constitution. However, it\n\n        would be significant to point out that there is no mention of\n\n        “dignity” specifically in this Chapter on Fundamental Rights.

In his\n\n        book, Taking Rights Seriously, he noted that everyone who takes\n\n        rights seriously must give an answer to the question why human\n\n        rights vis-a-vis the State exist. According to him, in order to give\n\n        such an answer one must accept, as a minimum, the idea of\n\n        human dignity. As he writes:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_285\">                    “Human dignity....associated with Kant, but defended\n                    by philosophers of different schgools, supposes that\n                    there are ways of treating a man that are inconsistent\n                    with recognizing him as a full member of the human\n                    community, and holds that such treatment is\n                    profoundly unjust.”45\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_286\">91) In his Book, “Is Democracy Possible Here?”46 Dworkin develops\n\n        two principles about the concept of human dignity. First principle\n\n        regards the intrinsic value of every person, viz., every person has\n\n        a special objective value which value is not only important to that\n\n        person alone but success or failure of the lives of every person is\n\n        important to all of us.              The second principle, according to\n\n        Dworkin, is that of personal responsibility.                    According to this\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_428\">45 Ibid., 1\n46 Ronald Dworkin, Is Democracy Possible Here?

Thus,\n\n          Dworkin&#x27;s jurisprudence of human dignity is founded on the\n\n          aforesaid two principles which, together, not only define the basis\n\n          but the conditions for human dignity. Dworkin went on to develop\n\n          and expand these principles in his book, Justice for Hedgehogs\n\n          (2011)47.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_430\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_431\">92) When speaking of rights, it is impossible to envisage it without\n\n          dignity.    In     his    pioneering          and     all    inclusive       “Justice       for\n\n          Hedgehogs”, he proffered an approach where respect for human\n\n          dignity, entails two requirements; first, self-respect, i.e., taking the\n\n          objective importance of one’s own life seriously; this represents\n\n          the free will of the person, his capacity to think for himself and to\n\n          control his own life and second, authenticity, i.e., accepting a\n\n          “special, personal responsibility for identifying what counts as\n\n          success” in one’s own life and for creating that life “through a\n\n          coherent narrative” that one has chosen. 48 According to Dworkin,\n\n          these principles form the fundamental criteria supervising what\n\n          we should do in order to live well. 49 They further explicate the\n\n47 Ibid 13\n48 Kenneth W.

It is what is\n\n        constitutionally recognised in our country and for good reason.\n\n        Living well is a moral responsibility of individuals; it is a continuing\n\n        process that is not a static condition of character but a mode that\n\n        an individual constantly endeavours to imbibe. A life lived without\n\n        dignity, is not a life lived at all for living well implies a conception\n\n        of human dignity which Dworkin interprets includes ideals of self-\n\n        respect and authenticity.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_432\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_433\">93) This constitutional value of human dignity, has been beautifully\n\n        illustrated by Aharon Barak, as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_287\">                    “Human dignity as a constitutional value is the factor\n                    that unites the human rights into one whole.

This normative\n                    unity is expressed in the three ways: first, the value of\n                    human dignity serves as a normative basis for\n                    constitutional rights set out in the constitution; second,\n                    it serves as an interpretative principle for determining\n                    the scope of constitutional rights, including the right to\n                    human dignity; third, the value of human dignity has\n                    an important role in determining the proportionality of\n                    a statute limiting a constitutional right.”51\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_288\">94) We have to keep in mind that while expounding the aforesaid\n\n        notion of dignity, Dworkin was not interpreting any Constitution.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_434\">50 Supra 15\n51 Aharon Barak, Human Dignity : The Constitutional Value and the Constitutional Right\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_428\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 215 of 2005                                              Page 69 of 112</span>\n\f        This notion of dignity, as conceptualised by Dworkin, fits like a\n\n        glove in our constitutional scheme.

The law\n                   should protect at least the basic liberties, that is, those\n                   necessary to the pursuit of any socially acceptable\n                   conception of the good life.

Hart has argued that (at least in a society where\n                   there is limited abundance of wealth and resources) it is\n                   rational to prefer basic freedoms to an improvement I\n                   material conditions only if one harbours the ideal of ‘a\n                   public-spirited citizen who prizes political activity and\n                   service to others as among the chief goods of life and\n                   could not contemplate as tolerable an exchange of the\n                   opportunities of such activity for mere material goods or\n                   contentment’.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_439\">                   A rather different thesis runs through Professor Joseph\n                   Raz’s book, The Morality of Freedom: people are\n                   autonomous moral actors, and autonomy is given\n                   expression primarily through making one’s own\n                   decisions, but such freedom is valuable partly because it\n                   advances social ends.           Raz points out that the\n                   identification of basic liberties therefore depends, in pat\n                   at least, on governmental notions of the public good. In\n                   respect of rights to freedom of expression, privacy,\n                   freedom of religion, and freedom from discrimination, for\n                   example, ‘one reason for affording special protection to\n                   individual interests is that thereby one also protects a\n                   collective good, an aspect of a public culture’. At the\n                   same time, certain social goods are needed if freedom is\n                   to have value. Freedom is useful only if the social and\n                   economic structure of society provides a sufficient range\n                   of choices to allow people’s capacity for choice to be\n                   exercised. Accordingly, freedom is seen as a collective\n                   rather than an individual good. This may constrain the\n                   range of freedoms and the purposes to which they may\n                   morally be put: a decision to make a freedom into a\n                   constitutional right is an expression of the collective\n                   political culture of a community. This thesis does not\n                   make the morality of freedom depend on people striving\n                   for perfection: individuals may not always, or ever, think\n                   about the moral consequences of their decisions, or may\n                   consciously make decisions which do not make for self-\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_440\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 215 of 2005                                  Page 72 of 112</span>\n\f                   improvement.       Instead, it looks only for a social\n                   commitment to the idea of the moral significance of\n                   individual choice. Raz marries the idea of the individual\n                   to that of society by recognizing that individual freedom\n                   of choice is contingent on social arrangements.”\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_440\">97) In his Article, Life’s Dominion, Ronald Dworkin, while building the\n\n        hypothesis on dignity concept, exhorts that people must decide\n\n        about their own death, or someone else’s in three main kind of\n\n        situations, namely, (i) conscious and competent: it is a situation\n\n        where a person is suffering from some serious illness because of\n\n        which he is incapacitated but he is still conscious and also\n\n        competent to decide about his fate, he should be given a choice\n\n        to decide as to whether he wants to continue to get the treatment;\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_441\">        (ii) unconscious: where the patient is unconscious and dying,\n\n        doctors are often forced to decide whether to continue life support\n\n        for him or not under certain circumstances relatives have to take\n\n        a decision.

Ward draws on the health economics\n\n        literature (for example, Mooney67) to suggest that a positive\n\n        answer to this question ins implicit in many health-rationing\n\n        decisions and is applicable to the euthanasia decision.

Their counter argument, therefore, is that to be able\n\n        to make an economic assessment of euthanasia, we would have\n\n        to be able to evaluate the cost and benefits of this act of killing.\n\n        However, even they accept that if the act of killing by euthanasia\n\n        is ethically acceptable in some circumstances, it would be\n\n        appropriate to consider the net benefits of the act to the individual\n\n67 Mooney, G.

If so,\n            under what circumstances and what precautions are\n            required while permitting it?\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_327\">123) In this writ petition, the petitioner has sought a direction to the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_460\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 215 of 2005                               Page 89 of 112</span>\n\f        respondents to adopt suitable procedures to ensure that persons\n\n        of deteriorated health or terminally ill should be able to execute a\n\n        document titled ‘living will and/or advance authorisation’ which\n\n        can be presented to the hospital for appropriate action in the\n\n        event of the executant being admitted to the hospital with serious\n\n        illness which may threaten termination of life of the executant. In\n\n        nutshell, the petitioner wants that citizens should have right to\n\n        decide in advance not to accept any kind of treatment at a stage\n\n        when they are terminally ill.   Expressing this in advance in a\n\n        document is known as ‘living will’ or ‘advance directive’, whereby\n\n        the aforesaid self-determination of the person is to be acted upon\n\n        when he reaches PVS or his brain dead/clinically dead.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_328\">124) It is an undisputed that Doctors’ primary duty is to provide\n\n        treatment and save life but not in the case when a person has\n\n        already expressed his desire of not being subjected to any kind of\n\n        treatment. It is a common law right of people, of any civilized\n\n        country, to refuse unwanted medical treatment and no person can\n\n        force him/her to take any medical treatment which the person\n\n        does not desire to continue with.

Passive euthanasia is usually defined as\n                    withdrawing medical treatment with a deliberate\n                    intention of causing the patient&#x27;s death. For example, if\n                    a patient requires kidney dialysis to survive, not giving\n                    dialysis although the machine is available, is passive\n                    euthanasia. Similarly, if a patient is in coma or on a\n                    heart-lung machine, withdrawing of the machine will\n                    ordinarily result in passive euthanasia. Similarly not\n                    giving life-saving medicines like antibiotics in certain\n                    situations may result in passive euthanasia. Denying\n                    food to a person in coma or PVS may also amount to\n                    passive euthanasia.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_330\">                    67. As already stated above, euthanasia can be both\n                    voluntary or non-voluntary. In voluntary passive\n                    euthanasia a person who is capable of deciding for\n                    himself decides that he would prefer to die (which may\n                    be for various reasons e.g. that he is in great pain or\n                    that the money being spent on his treatment should\n                    instead be given to his family who are in greater need,\n                    etc.), and for this purpose he consciously and of his\n                    own free will refuses to take life-saving medicines. In\n                    India, if a person consciously and voluntarily refuses\n                    to take life-saving medical treatment it is not a crime...\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_331\">                                   xxx           xxx           xxx\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_332\">                    78. ...

The patient’s life is at the brink of\n                    extinction. There is no slightest hope of recovery. The\n                    patient undergoing terrible suffering and worst mental\n                    agony does not want his life to be prolonged by\n                    artificial means.

This is not a situation comparable to\n                    suicide, keeping aside the view point in favour of\n                    decriminalizing the attempt to suicide. The doctor or\n                    relatives cannot compel him to have invasive medical\n                    treatment by artificial means or treatment. If there is\n                    forced medical intervention on his body, according to\n                    the decisions cited supra (especially the remarks of\n                    Lord Brown Wilkinson in Airdale’s case), the doctor /\n                    surgeon is guilty of ‘assault’ or ‘battery’. In the words\n                    of Justice Cardozo, “every human being of adult years\n                    and sound mind has a right to determine what shall be\n                    done with his own body and a surgeon who performs\n                    an operation without his patient’s consent commits an\n                    assault for which he is liable in damages.” Lord Goff in\n                    Airedale’s case places the right to self determination\n                    on a high pedestal. He observed that “in the\n                    circumstances such as this, the principle of sanctity of\n                    human life must yield to the principle of self\n                    determination and the doctor’s duty to act in the best\n                    interests of the patient must likewise be qualified by\n                    the wish of the patient.” The following observations of\n                    Lord Goff deserve particular notice:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_340\">                       “I wish to add that, in cases of this kind, there is\n                       no question of the patient having committed\n                       suicide, nor therefore of the doctor having aided\n                       or abetted him in doing so. It is simply that the\n                       patient has, as he is entitled to do, declined to\n                       consent to treatment which might or would have\n                       the effect of prolonging his life, and the doctor\n                       has, in accordance with his duty, complied with\n                       his patient&#x27;s wishes.”\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_341\">127) And finally, the Law Commission in its 241 st Report gave\n\n        Summary of Recommendations as under:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_342\">                    “14.

An individual&#x27;s rights\n                    to refuse life prolonging medical treatment or\n                    terminate his life is another freedom which falls within\n                    the zone of the right to privacy. I am conscious of the\n                    fact that the issue is pending before this Court. But in\n                    various other jurisdictions, there is a huge debate on\n                    those issues though it is still a grey area. [ For the\n                    legal debate in this area in US, See Chapter 15.11 of\n                    American Constitutional Law by Laurence H.

Similarly, the freedom to\n                    choose either to work or not and the freedom to\n                    choose the nature of the work are areas of private\n                    decision-making process. The right to travel freely\n                    within the country or go abroad is an area falling within\n                    the right to privacy.

Clause 11 of the draft Treatment of\n\n        Terminally-III Patients (Protection of Patients and Medical\n\n        Practitioners) Bill, 2016 states that advance directives or medical\n\n        power of attorney shall be void and of no effect and shall not be\n\n        binding on any medical practitioner. This blanket ban, including\n\n        the failure even to give some weight to advance directives while\n\n        making a decision about the withholding or withdrawal of life-\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_507\">        sustaining treatment is disproportionate. It does not constitute a\n\n        fair, just or reasonable procedure, which is a requirement for the\n\n        imposition of a restriction on the right to life (in this case,\n\n        expressed as the right to die with dignity) under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_298\">Article 21.</a>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_508\">131) At this juncture, we may again reiterate that on the one hand\n\n        autonomy of an individual gives him right to choose his destiny\n\n        and, therefore, he may decide before hand, in the form of\n\n        advance directive, at what stage of his physical condition he\n\n        would not like to have medical treatment, and on the other hand,\n\n        there are dangers of misuse thereof as well.               David Feldman\n\n        explained the same in the following manner:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_349\">                   “...However, while it is undoubtedly a criminal act to do\n                   anything intending to hasten another person’s death,\n                   there is no absolute duty on a doctor to try to save the life\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_477\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 215 of 2005                                  Page 102 of 112</span>\n\f                   of a patient, for two reasons.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_350\">                   The first is that any treatment is prima facie a trespass to\n                   the person, and if the patient is adult and competent to\n                   consent it will be unlawful without that consent. A doctor\n                   therefore acts lawfully – indeed, could not lawfully act\n                   otherwise – when he withholds treatment at the request\n                   of a terminally ill patient. This has been called passive,\n                   as distinct from active, euthanasia. To ensure that\n                   medical staff know of their wishes, some people have\n                   executed what are sometimes called ‘living wills’, giving\n                   directions to medical staff to withhold treatment in\n                   specified circumstances, and making their wishes known\n                   to anyone who might be appointed as their\n                   representative in the event that they become in capable\n                   for any reason. The efficacy of such prior indications was\n                   accepted, obiter, by Lord Goff in Airedale NHS Trust v.\n                   Bland, above.        In such circumstances, the patient\n                   voluntarily accepts non-treatment while in a state to do\n                   so rationally. However, where there is the slightest doubt\n                   about the wishes of a patient, that patient should be\n                   treated, because the paternalism which decides for\n                   someone else when it is best to die is effectively denying\n                   them the opportunity to make the most of their lives as\n                   autonomous individuals. Furthermore, it would seem to\n                   be wrong in principle to put pressure to bear on a patient\n                   to elect to die. In those states of the USA where\n                   voluntary euthanasia is lawful, the ethical problems for\n                   patients, doctors, next of kin, and nursing staff are\n                   immense. Where the patient is not mentally competent\n                   to confirm the choice to die at the time when the choice is\n                   about to be given effect, it will also be impossible to know\n                   whether the choice expressed earlier was truly voluntary,\n                   whether the consent was informed, and whether or not\n                   the patients would want to reconsider were he able to do\n                   so. In the Netherlands, where it is lawful to practice\n                   voluntary euthanasia, it seems that the procedural\n                   safeguards designed to protect people against\n                   involuntary euthanasia are very hard to enforce and are\n                   regularly flouted.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_351\">                   Secondly, the doctrine of double effect allows the doctor\n                   to take steps which carry a substantial risk to life in order\n                   to treat, in good faith and with the patient’s consent,\n                   some disease or symptom. This is essential, because\n                   virtually any treatment carries some risk to the patient. It\n                   is particularly relevant to the euthanasia issue in cases\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_478\">Writ Petition (Civil) No. 215 of 2005                                  Page 103 of 112</span>\n\f                   where the primary object (e.g. pain control in terminal\n                   cancer treatment) can only be achieved by administering\n                   drugs at a level which is likely to shorten life, but\n                   enhances the quality of life while it lasts. A trade-off\n                   between length of life and quality of life is permissible.”\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_352\">132) At the same time, possibility of misuse cannot be held to be a\n\n        valid ground for rejecting advance directive, as opined by the Law\n\n        Commission of India as well in its 196 th and 241st Report.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_509\">        Instead, attempt can be made to provide safeguards for exercise\n\n        of such advance directive. For example, <a href=\"/doc/117923983/\" id=\"a_299\">Section 5</a> of the Mental\n\n        Healthcare Act, 2017 recognises the validity of advance directives\n\n        for the treatment of mental illness under the <a href=\"/doc/14507371/\" id=\"a_300\">Mental Healthcare\n\n        Act, 2017</a>.          The draft Mental Healthcare Regulations have\n\n        recently been made available for public comment by the Ministry\n\n        of Health and Family Welfare. These prescribe the form in which\n\n        advance directives may be made.              Part II, Chapter 1 of the\n\n        Regulations allow a Nominated Representative to be named in\n\n        the Advance Directive. An advance directive is to be in writing\n\n        and signed by two witnesses attesting to the fact that the\n\n        Directive was executed in their presence.             A Directive to be\n\n        registered with the Mental Health Review Board.

The form in which this authorisation is to be made is\n\n        prescribed in Form 7 of the Transplantation of Human Organs\n\n        and Tissues Rules, 2014. This is also to be in writing and in the\n\n        presence of two witnesses. A copy of the pledge is to be retained\n\n        at the institution where the pledge is made and the person\n\n        making the pledge has the option to withdraw the pledge at any\n\n        time.     Where such authorisation had been made, the person\n\n        lawfully in charge of the donor’s body after his death is required\n\n        to grant the concerned medical practitioner all reasonable\n\n        facilities for the removal of human organs or tissues, unless such\n\n        person has reason to believe that the donor had substantially\n\n        revoked his authority.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_510\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_511\">133) Mr. Datar, learned counsel appearing for the intervenor, has also\n\n        brought to our notice various safeguards for advance directive\n\n        provided in other jurisdiction in many ways i.e. by prescribing the\n\n        form that the directive must take, by specifying who may act as\n\n        witnesses, by allowing the possibility of amendment and by\n\n        allowing the validity of the directive to be challenged.

Every moment of our lives, our bodies\n\nare involved in a process of continuous change. Millions of our cells perish as\n\nnature regenerates new ones. Our minds are rarely, if ever, constant. Our\n\nthoughts are fleeting. In a physiological sense, our being is in a state of flux,\n\nchange being the norm. Life is not disconnected from death. To be, is to die.\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_488\">                                        1</span>\n\f                                                                                 PART A\n\n\nFrom a philosophical perspective, there is no antithesis between life and\n\ndeath. Both constitute essential elements in the inexorable cycle of existence.\n\n\n\n\n2     Living in the present, we are conscious of our own mortality. Biblical\n\nteaching reminds us that:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_368\">             “There is a time for everything, and a season for every activity\n             under the heavens : a time to be born and a time to die, a\n             time to plant, and a time to uproot, a time to kill and a time to\n             heal, a time to wear down and a time to build, a time to weep\n             and a time to laugh, a time to mourn and a time to dance.”\n             (Ecclesiastes 3)\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_520\">3     The quest of each individual to find meaning in life reflects a human\n\nurge to find fulfilment in the pursuit of happiness. The pursuit of happiness is\n\nnurtured in creative pleasures and is grounded in things as fundamental as\n\nthe freedom to think, express and believe, the right to self-determination, the\n\nliberty to follow a distinctive way of life, the ability to decide whether or not to\n\nconform and the expression of identity.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_521\">\n\n4     Human beings through the ages have been concerned with death as\n\nmuch as with dying. Death represents a culmination, the terminal point of life.\n\nDying is part of a process: the process of living, which eventually leads to\n\ndeath. The fear of death is a universal feature of human existence. The fear is\n\nassociated as much with the uncertainty of when death will occur as it is, with\n\nthe suffering that may precede it. The fear lies in the uncertainty of when an\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_489\">                                               2</span>\n\f                                                                                 PART A\n\n\nevent which is certain will occur. Our fears are enhanced by the experience of\n\ndying that we share with those who were a part of our lives but have gone\n\nbefore us. As human beings, we are concerned with the dignity of our\n\nexistence. The process through which we die bears upon that dignity. A\n\ndignified existence requires that the days of our lives which lead up to death\n\nmust be lived in dignity; that the stages through which life leads to death\n\nshould be free of suffering; and that the integrity of our minds and bodies\n\nshould survive so long as life subsists. The fear of an uncertain future\n\nconfronts these aspirations of a dignified life. The fear is compounded by the\n\nfact that as we age, we lose control over our faculties and over our ability to\n\ntake decisions on the course of our future. Our autonomy as persons is\n\nfounded on the ability to decide: on what to wear and how to dress, on what to\n\neat and on the food that we share, on when to speak and what we speak, on\n\nthe right to believe or not to believe, on whom to love and whom to partner,\n\nand to freely decide on innumerable matters of consequence and detail to our\n\ndaily lives. Ageing leaves individuals with a dilution of the ability to decide. The\n\nfear of that loss is ultimately, a fear of the loss of freedom. Freedom and\n\nliberty are the core of a meaningful life. Ageing brings dependency and a loss\n\nof control over our ability to shape what we wish to happen to us.\n\n\n\n5     The progression of life takes its toll on the human body and the mind.\n\nAs we age, simple tasks become less simple and what seemed to be a matter\n\nof course may become less so. Human beings then turn ever more to the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_490\">                                         3</span>\n\f                                                                                                               PART A\n\n\nsubstance that matters. As events, relationships, associations and even\n\nmemories fall by the way, we are left with a lonesome remnant of the person,\n\nwhich defines the core of our existence. The quest of finding meaning in that\n\ncore is often a matter of confronting our fears and tragedies.\n\n\n\n6          The fear of pain and suffering is perhaps even greater than the\n\napprehension of death. To be free of suffering is a liberation in itself. Hence\n\nthe liberty to decide how one should be treated when the end of life is near is\n\npart of an essential attribute of personhood. Our expectations define how we\n\nshould be treated in progressing towards the end, even when an individual is\n\nleft with little or no comprehension near the end of life.\n\n\n\n7          Dilemmas relating to the end of life have been on the frontline of debate\n\nacross the world in recent decades. The debate has presented “a complex\n\nmaze of dilemmas for all - the doctor, the lawyer, the patient and the patient’s\n\nrelatives”1 and straddles issues of religion, morality, bio-medical ethics and\n\nconstitutional law. It has involved “issues ranging from the nature and\n\nmeaning of human life itself, to the most fundamental principles on which our\n\nsocieties are and should be based”2.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_522\">\n\n\n1   “The Dilemmas of Euthanasia”, Bio-Science (August 1973), Vol. 23, No. 8, at page 459\n2    Margaret A.

Diseases once considered fatal have\n\nnow become treatable. Medical research has redefined our knowledge of\n\nailments – common and uncommon; of their links with bodily functions and the\n\ncomplex relationship between mental processes and physical well-being.\n\nScience which affects the length of life also has an impact on the quality of the\n\nyears in our lives. Prolonging life should, but does not necessarily result in, a\n\nreduction of suffering. Suffering has a bearing on the quality of life. The quality\n\nof life depends upon the life in our years. Adding to the length of life must bear\n\na functional nexus with the quality of life. Human suffering must have\n\nsignificance not only in terms of how long we live but also in terms of how well\n\nwe live.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_523\">\n\n9       Modern medicine has advanced human knowledge about the body and\n\nthe mind. Equipped with the tools of knowledge, science has shown the ability\n\nto reduce human suffering.

While medical science has extended longevity, it has come\n\nwith associated costs of medical care and the agony which accompanies an\n\nartificially sustained life. Medical ethics must grapple with the need to bring\n\nabout a balance between the ability of science to extend life with the need for\n\nscience to recognise that all knowledge must enhance a meaningful\n\nexistence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_524\">\n\n\n10      There is “no consensus as to the rights and wrongs of helping someone\n\nto die”4, as the legal status of euthanasia has been subjected to social, ethical\n\nand moral norms that have been handed down to us. Decisions regarding the\n\nend of life can be ethically more problematic when the individual is no longer\n\nmentally competent to make his or her own decisions.5 The existential and\n\nmetaphysical issues involved in this debate, include the fear of the unknown,\n\nthe uncertainty of when death will occur, the scarcity of health care, freedom\n\nor coercion in choosing to receive or not to receive medical treatment, the\n\ndignity and degradation of ageing and being able to care for oneself\n\nindependently.6\n\n\n\n\n11      Does the law have a role in these complex questions of life and death?\n\nIf it does, what are the boundaries which judges – as interpreters of law –\n4 Alan Norrie, “Legal Form and Moral Judgement: Euthanasia and Assisted Suicide” in R.A.

Among the issues which we confront are:\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_369\">(i)     Does an individual have a constitutionally recognized right to refuse\n\n        medical treatment or to reject a particular form of medical treatment;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_370\">(ii)    If an individual does possess such a right, does a right inhere in the\n\n        individual to determine what course of action should be followed in the\n\n        future if she or he were to lose control over the faculties which enable\n\n        them to accept or refuse medical treatment;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_371\">(iii)   Does the existence of a right in the individual impose a corresponding\n\n        duty on a medical professional who attends to the individual, to respect\n\n        the right and what, if any, are the qualifications of that duty;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_372\">(iv)    Does the law permit a medical practitioner to withhold or refuse medical\n\n        treatment towards the end of life to an individual who is no longer in\n\n        control of his or her faculties in deference to a desire expressed while in\n\n        a fit state of mind; and\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_496\">                                           7</span>\n\f                                                                                       PART A\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_373\">(v)        Would a withholding or refusal of medical treatment be permissible so\n\n           as to allow life to take its natural course, bereft of an artificial\n\n           intervention, when there is no realistic hope of return to a normal life.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_525\">12         This Court has to consider euthanasia and its impact “not only at an\n\nindividual level”, but also at the “institutional, governmental and societal\n\nlevels”.7 The impact has to be analyzed not only in the context of the present\n\nera, but has to be contemplated for the future as well. The judge is not a\n\nsoothsayer. Nor does the law have predictive tools at its command which can\n\napproximate those available to a scientist. Constitutional principle must have\n\nan abiding value. It can have that value if it is firmly grounded in the distilled\n\nexperience of the past, is flexible to accommodate the concerns of the present\n\nand allows room for the unforeseeable future. The possibility of the abuse of\n\neuthanasia and the effect that legalising euthanasia would have on intangible\n\nsocietal fabrics and institutions is of utmost concern.\n\n\n\n13         Contemporary writing on the subject reminds us about how serious\n\nthese issues are and of how often they pose real dilemmas in medicine.

At the\n\nheart of the proceeding, is a declaration which Common Cause seeks that the\n\nright to die with dignity is a fundamental right which arises from the right to live\n\n\n10   Henry Marsh, Admissions: A Life in Brain Surgery, (Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, 2017), at page 265-266\n11   Randy Pausch and Jeffrey Zaslow, The Last Lecture, (Hodder &amp; Stoughton, 2008), at page 17\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_499\">                                                        10</span>\n\f                                                                                 PART B\n\n\nwith dignity. <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_310\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution is a guarantee against the\n\ndeprivation of life or personal liberty except according to the procedure\n\nestablished by law. As our law has evolved, the right against the violation of\n\nlife and personal liberty has acquired much more than a formal content. It can\n\nhave true meaning, if only it includes the right to live with dignity. It is on this\n\npremise that the court is urged to hold that death with dignity is an essential\n\npart of a life of dignity. A direction is sought to the Union Government to adopt\n\nsuitable procedures to ensure that persons with “deteriorated health” or those\n\nwho are terminally ill should be able to execute a document in the form of “a\n\nliving will and attorney authorization” which can be presented to a hospital for\n\nappropriate action if the person who has made it, is hospitalized with a serious\n\nillness which may cause the end of life. The petitioner also seeks, in the\n\nalternative, that this Court should issue guidelines and appoint an expert\n\ncommittee consisting of doctors, social scientists and lawyers who will govern\n\nthe making of ‘living wills’.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_532\">\n\n17     Individuals who suffer from chronic disease or approach the end of the\n\nspan of natural life often lapse into terminal illness or a permanent vegetative\n\nstate. When a medical emergency leads to hospitalization, individuals in that\n\ncondition are sometimes deprived of their right to refuse unwanted medical\n\ntreatment such as feeding through hydration tubes or being kept on a\n\nventilator and other life support equipment. Life is prolonged artificially\n\nresulting in human suffering. The petition is founded on the right of each\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_500\">                                         11</span>\n\f                                                                                 PART B\n\n\nindividual to make an informed choice. Documenting a wish in advance, not to\n\nbe subjected to artificial means of prolonging life, should the individual not be\n\nin a position later to comprehend or decline treatment, is a manifestation of\n\nindividual choice and autonomy. The process of ageing is marked by a sense\n\nof helplessness. Human faculties decline as we grow older. Social aspects of\n\nageing, such as the loss of friendships and associations combine with the\n\npersonal and intimate to enhance a sense of isolation. The boundaries and\n\neven the limits of constitutional law will be tested as the needs of the ageing\n\nand their concerns confront issues of ethics, morality and of dignity in death.\n\n\n\n18         In support of its contention, the petitioner relies upon two decisions: a\n\ndecision rendered in 1996 by a Constitution Bench in Gian Kaur v State of\n\nPunjab12 (“Gian Kaur”) and a decision of 2011 rendered by two judges in\n\nAruna Ramachandra Shanbaug v Union of India13 (“Aruna Shanbaug”).\n\nThe decision in Gian Kaur arose from a conviction for the abetment of\n\nsuicide. In an earlier decision rendered by two judges in 1994 - P Rathinam v\n\nUnion of India14 (“Rathinam”), penalising an attempt to commit suicide was\n\nheld to violate <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_311\">Article 21</a> on the foundation that the right to life includes the\n\nright to die. The decision in Rathinam was held not to have laid down the\n\ncorrect principle, in Gian Kaur. Hence the decision in Aruna Shanbaug noted\n\nthat <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_312\">Article 21</a> does not protect the right to die and an attempt to commit\n\nsuicide is a crime. However, in Aruna Shanbaug, the court held that since\n\n12(1996) 2 SCC 648\n13 (2011) 15 SCC 480\n14 (1994) 3 SCC 394\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_501\">                                           12</span>\n\f                                                                                               PART B\n\n\nGian Kaur rules that the right to life includes living with human dignity, “in the\n\ncase of a dying person who is terminally ill or in a permanent vegetative state,\n\nhe may be permitted to terminate by a premature extinction of his life”, and\n\nthis would not be a crime. The Bench which decided Aruna Shanbaug was of\n\nthe view that Gian Kaur had “quoted with approval” the view of the House of\n\nLords in the UK in Airedale NHS Trust v Bland15 (“Airedale”).\n\n\n\n19         When these judgments were placed before a Bench of three judges in\n\nthe    present         case,    the     court    observed       that    there     were   “inherent\n\ninconsistencies” in the judgment in Aruna Shanbaug.

The Constitution Bench held thus:\n\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_385\">            “When a man commits suicide he has to undertake certain\n            positive overt acts and the genesis of those acts cannot be\n            traced to, or be included within the protection of the &#x27;right to\n            life&#x27; under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_324\">Article 21.</a> The significant aspect of &#x27;sanctity of life&#x27;\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_511\">                                              15</span>\n\f                                                                                   PART C\n\n\n             is also not to be overlooked. <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_325\">Article 21</a> is a provision\n             guaranteeing protection of life and personal liberty and by no\n             stretch of imagination can &#x27;extinction of life&#x27; be read to be\n             included in &#x27;protection of life&#x27;. Whatever may be the\n             philosophy of permitting a person to extinguish his life by\n             committing suicide, we find it difficult to construe <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_326\">Article 21</a> to\n             include within it the &#x27;right to die&#x27; as a part of the fundamental\n             right guaranteed therein. &#x27;Right to life&#x27; is a natural right\n             embodied in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_327\">Article 21</a> but suicide is an unnatural termination\n             or extinction of life, and therefore, incompatible and\n             inconsistent with the concept of &#x27;right to life&#x27;. With respect and\n             in all humility, we find no similarity in the nature of the other\n             rights, such as the right to &#x27;freedom of speech&#x27; etc. to provide\n             a comparable basis to hold that the &#x27;right to life&#x27; also includes\n             the &#x27;right to die&#x27;. With respect, the comparison is inapposite,\n             for the reason indicated in the context of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_328\">Article 21.</a> The\n             decisions relating to other fundamental rights wherein the\n             absence of compulsion to exercise a right was held to be\n             included within the exercise of that right, are not available to\n             support the view taken in P. Rathinam qua Article 21.”\n\n\nThe Court further held that:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_386\">             “To give meaning and content to the word &#x27;life&#x27; in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_329\">Article 21</a>, it\n             has been construed as life with human dignity. Any aspect of\n             life which makes it dignified may be read into it but not that\n             which extinguishes it and is, therefore, inconsistent with the\n             continued existence of life resulting in effacing the right itself.\n             The &#x27;right to die&#x27;, if any, is inherently inconsistent with the\n             &#x27;right to life&#x27; as is &#x27;death&#x27; with &#x27;life&#x27;.”\n\n\nGian Kaur holds that life within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_330\">Article 21</a> means a life of\n\ndignity. Extinguishment of life is (in that view) inconsistent with its continued\n\nexistence. Hence, as a matter of textual construction, the right to life has been\n\nheld not to include the right to die. In coming to that conclusion, it appears that\n\nGian Kaur emphasises two strands (which the present judgment will revisit at\n\na later stage). The first strand is the sanctity of life, which <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_331\">Article 21</a>\n\nrecognises. Extinction of life, would in this view, in the manner which\n\nRathinam allowed, violate the sanctity of life. The second strand that emerges\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_512\">                                               16</span>\n\f                                                                                                 PART C\n\n\nfrom Gian Kaur is that the right to life is a natural right. Suicide as an\n\nunnatural extinction of life is incompatible with it. The court distinguishes the\n\nright to life under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_332\">Article 21</a> from other rights which are guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_333\">Article\n\n19</a> such as the freedom of speech and expression. While free speech may\n\ninvolve the absence of a compulsion to exercise the right (the right not to\n\nspeak) this could not be said about the right to life. The Constitution Bench\n\nnoticed the debate on euthanasia in the context of individuals in a permanent\n\nvegetative state. A scholarly article on the decision notes that the Constitution\n\nBench “seemed amenable to an exception being made for euthanasia in\n\ncases of patients in a condition of PVS16. This view of the decision in Gian\n\nKaur does find support in the following observations of the Constitution\n\nBench:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_387\">                “Protagonism of euthanasia on the view that existence in\n                persistent vegetative state (PVS) is not a benefit to the patient\n                of a terminal illness being unrelated to the principle of ‘Sanctity\n                of life&#x27; or the &#x27;right to live with dignity&#x27; is of no assistance to\n                determine the scope of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_334\">Article 21</a> for deciding whether the\n                guarantee of &#x27;right to life&#x27; therein includes the &#x27;right to die&#x27;. The\n                &#x27;right to life&#x27; including the right to live with human dignity would\n                mean the existence of such a right up to the end of natural life.\n                This also includes the right to a dignified life up to the point of\n                death including a dignified procedure of death. In other words,\n                this may include the right of a dying man to also die with\n                dignity when his life is ebbing out. But the &#x27;right to die&#x27; with\n                dignity at the end of life is not to be confused or equated with\n                the &#x27;right to die&#x27; an unnatural death curtailing the natural span\n                of life.” (Para 24)\n\n\n\n\n16SushilaRao, “India and Euthanasia: The Poignant Case of Aruna Shanbaug”, Oxford Medical Law Review,\n Volume 19, Issue 4 (1 December 2011), at pages 646–656\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_513\">                                                  17</span>\n\f                                                                                                                PART C\n\n\n However, in the paragraph which followed, the Constitution Bench\n\n distinguished between cases where a premature end to life may be\n\n permissible, when death is imminent, from the right to commit suicide:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_388\">                     “A question may arise, in the context of a dying man, who is,\n                     terminally ill or in a persistent vegetative state that he may be\n                     permitted to terminate it by a premature extinction of his life in\n                     those circumstances. This category of cases may fall within\n                     the ambit of the &#x27;right to die&#x27; with dignity as a part of right to\n                     live with dignity, when death due to termination of natural life\n                     is certain and imminent and the process of natural death has\n                     commenced. These are not cases of extinguishing life but\n                     only of accelerating conclusion of the process of natural death\n                     which has already commenced. The debate even in such\n                     cases to permit physician assisted termination of life is\n                     inconclusive. It is sufficient to reiterate that the argument to\n                     support the view of permitting termination of life in such cases\n                     to reduce the period of suffering during the process of certain\n                     natural death is not available to interpret <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_335\">Article 21</a> to include\n                     therein the right to curtail the natural span of life.” (Para 25)\n\n\n\n On this foundation, the Constitution Bench held that <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_336\">Article 21</a> does not\n\n include the right to die. The right to live with human dignity, in this view, could\n\n not be construed to include the right to terminate natural life “at least before\n\n commencement of the natural process of certain death”.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_389\"> This Court’s holding in Gian Kaur that the right to life does not include the\n\n right to die in the context of suicide may require to be revisited in future in view\n\n of        domestic         and        international           developments17           pointing        towards\n\n decriminalisation of suicide. <a href=\"/doc/14507371/\" id=\"a_337\">In India, the Mental Healthcare Act</a> 2017 has\n\n\n\n\n17   “Humanization and Decriminalization of Attempt to Suicide”, Law Commission of India (Report No. 210, 2008);\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_536\">      Rajeev Ranjan, et al, “(De-) Criminalization of Attempted Suicide in India: A Review”, Industrial Psychiatry\n      Journal (2014), Vol. 23, issue 1, at page 4–9\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_514\">                                                          18</span>\n\f                                                                           PART C\n\n\ncreated a “presumption of severe stress in cases of attempt to commit\n\nsuicide”. <a href=\"/doc/20529713/\" id=\"a_338\">Section 115(1)</a> provides thus:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_390\">             “Notwithstanding anything contained in <a href=\"/doc/1501595/\" id=\"a_339\">section 309</a> of the\n             Indian Penal Code any person who attempts to commit\n             suicide shall be presumed, unless proved otherwise, to have\n             severe stress and shall not be tried and punished under the\n             said Code.”\n\n\n\nUnder <a href=\"/doc/191199928/\" id=\"a_340\">Section 115(2)</a>, the Act also mandates the Government to provide care,\n\ntreatment and rehabilitation to a person, having severe stress and who\n\nattempted to commit suicide, to reduce the risk of recurrence. <a href=\"/doc/53099207/\" id=\"a_341\">Section 115</a>\n\nbegins with a non-obstante provision, specifically with reference to Section\n\n309 of the Penal Code.

The\n\nemphasis on life as a right and not as a duty or obligation has also been\n\nexpressed by several other legal scholars:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_538\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_391\">                    “When, by electing euthanasia, the individual has expressly\n                    renounced his right to life, the state cannot reasonably assert\n                    an interest in protecting that right as a basis for overriding the\n                    individual&#x27;s private decision to die.

Euthanasia\n             is not lawful at common law. It is of course well known\n             that there are many responsible members of our society\n             who believe that euthanasia should be made lawful; but\n             that result could, I believe, only be achieved by\n             legislation which expresses the democratic will\n              that so fundamental a change should be made in our\n             law, and can, if enacted, ensure that such legalised\n             killing can only be carried out subject to appropriate\n             supervision and control....

This may consist of\n\nwithholding antibiotics without which the patient may die or the removing of\n\nthe patient from artificial heart/lung support. According to the court, a\n\ncomparative context of the position prevailing in other countries would indicate\n\nthat:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_395\">            “39…The general legal position all over the world seems to\n            be that while active euthanasia is illegal unless there is\n            legislation permitting it, passive euthanasia is legal even\n            without legislation provided certain conditions and\n            safeguards are maintained.”              (Id at page 491)\n\n\n\nVoluntary euthanasia envisages the consent of the patient being taken\n\nwhereas non-voluntary euthanasia deals with a situation where the patient is\n\nin a condition where he or she is unable to give consent. The Court noted that\n\na distinction is drawn between euthanasia and physician assisted death in the\n\nform of a physician or third party who administers it. Physician assisted\n\nsuicide involves a situation where the patient carries out the procedure,\n\nthough on the advice of the doctor.

An important\n            idea behind this distinction is that in “passive euthanasia” the\n            doctors are not actively killing anyone; they are simply not\n            saving him.”                                   (Id at page 492)\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_523\">                                            23</span>\n\f                                                                               PART D\n\n\nThe above extract indicates that the decision is premised on the performance\n\nof an act (in active euthanasia) and an omission (in passive euthanasia).\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_397\">Active euthanasia, in the view of the court, would be an offence under Section\n\n302 or at least under Section 304 while physician assisted suicide would be\n\nan offence under Section 306 of the Penal Code.

On the facts of the case, the court held that the petitioner who had\n\nvisited Aruna Shanbaug only on a few occasions and had written a book on\n\nher could not be recognised as her next friend. It was only the hospital staff\n\nwhich had cared for her for long years which would be recognised.

This hypothesis is incorrect. There\n\nwas only a passing reference to the decision of the House of Lords. In fact,\n\nGian Kaur prefaces its reference to Airedale with the following observation:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_403\">                    “40…Even though it is not necessary to deal with physician-\n                    assisted suicide or euthanasia cases, a brief reference to this\n                    decision cited at the Bar may be made.”   (Id at page 665)\n\n\n\nThe decision in Gian Kaur referred to the distinction made in Airedale\n\nbetween cases in which a physician decides not to provide or to continue to\n\nprovide treatment which would prolong life and cases in which a physician\n\ndecides to actively bring an end to the life of the patient by administering a\n\nlethal drug. The court in Airedale observed that actively causing the death of\n\nthe patient could be made lawful only by legislation. It was this aspect which\n\nwas emphasised by the judgment in Gian Kaur. Hence, the position adopted\n\nin Aruna Shanbaug, that the Constitution Bench in Gian Kaur quoted\n\nAiredale with approval (as the basis of allowing passive euthanasia) is\n\nseriously problematic. In fact, the extract from Airedale which was cited in\n\nGian Kaur indicates the emphasis placed on the need to bring in legislation to\n\nallow active euthanasia.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_545\">29         In an incisive analysis20, Ratna Kapur argues that while focussing on\n\neuthanasia,           discussions        on     Aruna        Shanbaug          have       ignored   other\n\nconsiderations regarding gender, sexual assault, what constitutes “caring”, the\n\n20   Ratna Kapur, “The Spectre of Aruna Shanbaug”, The Wire (18 May 2015), available at\n     https://thewire.in/2005/the-spectre-of-aruna-shanbaug/\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_527\">                                                       26</span>\n\f                                                                               PART D\n\n\nright to bodily integrity and workplace protection. A central issue is, according\n\nto Kapur, the “politics of caring”, - who can care, has the capacity to care and\n\nwho is less caring or less capable of caring. The Supreme Court did not\n\naccept Pinki Virani as the “next friend” but awarded guardianship to KEM\n\nhospital staff on the ground that they had “an emotional bonding and\n\nattachment” to Aruna Shanbaug and were her “real family.”        Kapur observes\n\nthat an emotional bond is not a valid criterion for a “next friend” and the\n\nexpression “real family” has dangerous implications for those who may not fall\n\nwithin the normative remit of that phrase though they have a relationship with\n\nthe concerned person. She asks if the concept of “next friend” will cover only\n\n“biological familial ties” and “render all other non-familial, non-marital, non-\n\nheterosexual relationships as ineligible?” She argues that decisions about life\n\nand death should “rest on the anvil of dignity, and dignity is not a family value,\n\nor linked to some essential gendered trait. It is a societal value and hence\n\nneeds to be delinked from the traditional frameworks of family and gender\n\nstereotypes.” Kapur expresses concerns about how the focus on “care”\n\nseemed to obscure a deeper and more important consideration regarding\n\nwomen’s safety in the workplace. The attack on Aruna Shanbaug in KEM\n\nhospital was indicative of how the workplace was unsafe for women, and yet\n\nthe staff of the same hospital were given her guardianship. This is especially\n\nconcerning given the fact that the dean of the hospital at the time refused to\n\nallow a complaint of sodomy to go forward as he was more concerned about\n\nthe reputation of the institution. Kapur laments the fact that Aruna’s case was\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_528\">                                       27</span>\n\f                                                                               PART D\n\n\nnot used to bring out the reform that it should have - stating that it should\n\n‘have been a leading case on women’s rights where “caring” extended beyond\n\nthe physical support for the individual who was harmed, to taking active steps\n\nto improve the working conditions for women, including addressing pervasive\n\nand systemic sex discrimination and sexism.’ Lastly, Kapur compels us to\n\nthink about the choices Aruna Shanbaug may have made - “Had Shanbaug\n\nnot been reduced to a PVS, would she have chosen to remain in KEM for her\n\ntreatment after the violent and brutal sexual assault that she experienced in\n\nher work place? Or would she have chosen to be treated elsewhere? Would\n\nshe have sued the hospital for failing to provide her a safe working\n\nenvironment?” Thus, Kapur questions the very basis of making the hospital\n\nthe guardians by questioning why the hospital did not “care” when it mattered\n\nthe most - when the case of sexual assault and sodomy should have been\n\npursued by the hospital on behalf of its employee. By denying Aruna\n\nShanbaug the right to bodily integrity in life and the right to self-determination\n\nin death, and by viewing her life from all lenses but from her own, ranging from\n\nthe “carers”, to the medical and legal profession and their views on\n\neuthanasia, she “became nothing more than a spectre in her own story.”\n\n\n\n30    Aruna Shanbaug also presents another problem- one of inconsistency.\n\nGian Kaur is construed as laying down only that the right to life does not\n\ninclude the right to die and that the decision in Rathinam was incorrect. In that\n\ncontext, it has been noticed that the Constitution Bench observed that the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_529\">                                       28</span>\n\f                                                                                PART D\n\n\ndebate overseas even in physician assisted termination of life is inconclusive.\n\nAruna Shanbaug finds, on the one hand, that “no final view was expressed”\n\nin Gian Kaur beyond stating that the right to life does not include the right to\n\ndie. Yet, on the other hand, having inferred the absence of a final view on\n\neuthanasia in Gian Kaur, that decision is subsequently construed as having\n\nallowed the termination of life by a premature extinction in the case of a “dying\n\nperson who is terminally ill or in a permanent vegetative state”. Both lines of\n\nreasoning cannot survive together.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_546\">\n\n31    The procedure which was followed by this Court in Aruna Shanbaug of\n\narranging for a screening of a CD submitted by the team of doctors pertaining\n\nto her examination in a live court proceeding open to the public has been\n\ncriticised as being fundamentally violative of privacy. What transpired in the\n\ncourt is set out in the following observations from the decision:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_404\">             “11. On 2-3-2011, the matter was listed again before us and we\n             first saw the screening of the CD submitted by the team of\n             doctors along with their report. We had arranged for the\n             screening of the CD in the courtroom, so that all present in the\n             Court could see the condition of Aruna Shanbaug. For doing so,\n             we have relied on the precedent of the Nuremburg trials in which\n             a screening was done in the courtroom of some of the Nazi\n             atrocities during the Second World War.”      (Id at page 476)\n\n\n\nThis aspect of the case is indeed disquieting. To equate a patient in PVS for\n\nthirty-seven years following a sexual assault, with the trials of Nazi war\n\ncriminals is seriously disturbing.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_530\">                                            29</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_405\">\f                                                                                PART D\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_547\">32    Aruna Shanbaug rests on the distinction between an act and an\n\nomission. The court seems to accept that the withdrawal of life support or a\n\ndecision not to provide artificial support to prolong life is an omission. In the\n\nview of the court, an omission is what is “not done”. On the other hand, what is\n\nactively done to end life is held to stand on a separate foundation. At this\n\nstage, it would be necessary to note that the validity of the distinction between\n\nwhat is passive and what is active has been the subject of a considerable\n\ndegree of debate. This would be dealt with in a subsequent part of this\n\njudgment.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_548\">\n\n33    The issue before the Constitution Bench in Gian Kaur related to the\n\nconstitutionality of Section 306 of the Penal Code which penalises the\n\nabetment of suicide. The challenge proceeded on the foundation that\n\npenalising an attempt to commit suicide had been held to be unconstitutional\n\nsince the right to live included the right to die. The Constitution Bench\n\nemphasised the value ascribed to the sanctity of life and came to the\n\nconclusion that the right to die does not emanate from the right to life under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_350\">Article 21.</a> Having held that the right to die is “inherently inconsistent” with the\n\nright to life “as is death with life”, the Constitution Bench opined that the\n\ndebate on euthanasia was “of no assistance to determine the scope of Article\n\n21” and to decide whether the right to life includes the right to die. The court\n\nnoted that the right to life embodies the right to live with human dignity which\n\npostulates the existence of such a right “up to the end of natural life”. This, the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_531\">                                        30</span>\n\f                                                                                PART D\n\n\ncourt observed included the right to lead a dignified life up to the point of death\n\nand included a dignified procedure of death. Thus, in the context of the debate\n\non euthanasia, the Constitution Bench was careful in observing that the right\n\nto a dignified life “may include” the right of an individual to die with dignity. A\n\npremature termination of life of a person facing imminent death in a terminal\n\nillness or in a permanent vegetative state was in the view of the court a\n\nsituation which “may fall” within the ambit of the right to die with dignity. The\n\ndebate on physician assisted termination of life was noted to be\n\n“inconclusive”. The court observed that the argument to support the\n\ntermination of life in such cases to reduce the period of suffering during the\n\nprocess of “certain natural death” was not available to interpret <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_351\">Article 21</a> as\n\nembodying the right to curtail the natural span of life. These observations in\n\nGian Kaur would indicate that the Constitution Bench has not made a final or\n\nconclusive determination on euthanasia. Indeed, the scope of the controversy\n\nbefore the court did not directly involve that question. Aruna Shanbaug\n\nevidently proceeds on a construction of the decision in Gian Kaur which does\n\nnot emerge from it. Aruna Shanbaug has inherent internal inconsistencies.\n\nHence, the controversy which has been referred to the Constitution Bench\n\nwould have to be resolved without regarding Aruna Shanbaug as having laid\n\ndown an authoritative principle of constitutional law.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_532\">                                        31</span>\n\f                                                                                PART E\n\n\nE      The distinction between the legality of active and passive euthanasia\n\n34     In examining the legality of euthanasia, clarification of terminology is\n\nessential. The discourse on euthanasia is rendered complex by the problems\n\nof shifting and uncertain descriptions of key concepts. Central to the debate\n\nare notions such as “involuntary”, “non-voluntary” and “voluntary”. Also\n\n“active” and “passive” are used, particularly in combination with “voluntary”\n\neuthanasia. In general, the following might be said: ·\n\n\n     • involuntary euthanasia refers to the termination of life against the will of\n\n        the person killed;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_549\">     • non-voluntary euthanasia refers to the termination of life without the\n\n        consent or opposition of the person killed; ·\n\n     • voluntary euthanasia refers to the termination of life at the request of\n\n        the person killed; ·\n\n     • active euthanasia refers to a positive contribution to the acceleration of\n\n        death;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_550\">     • passive euthanasia refers to the omission of steps which might\n\n        otherwise sustain life.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_551\">\nWhat is relatively straightforward is that involuntary euthanasia is illegal and\n\namounts to murder. However, the boundaries between active and passive\n\neuthanasia are blurred since it is quite possible to argue that an omission\n\namounts to a positive act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_552\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_533\">                                         32</span>\n\f                                                                                                     PART E\n\n\n35         The expression ‘passive’ has been used to denote the withdrawal or\n\nwithholding of medical treatment. Implicit in this definition is the assumption\n\nthat both the withdrawal of or withholding treatment stand on the same ethical\n\nor moral platform. This assumption, as we shall see in a later part of this\n\nsection, is not free of logical difficulty. The voluntary or non-voluntary\n\ncharacter of the euthanasia is determined by the presence or absence of\n\nconsent. Consent postulates that the individual is in a mental condition which\n\nenables her to choose and to decide on a course of action and convey this\n\ndecision. Its voluntary nature is premised on its consensual character.\n\nEuthanasia becomes non-voluntary where the individual has lost those\n\nfaculties of mind which enable her to freely decide on the course of action or\n\nlost the ability to communicate the chosen course of action.\n\n\n\n\n36         The distinctions between active and passive euthanasia are based on\n\nthe manner in which death is brought about. They closely relate (in the words\n\nof Hazel Biggs in a seminal work on the subject) to the understanding and\n\nconsequences of the legal concepts of act and omission.21\n\n\n\n\n37         As early as 1975, American philosopher and medical ethicist James\n\nRachels offered a radical critique of a distinction that was widely accepted by\n\nmedical ethicists at that time, that passive euthanasia or “letting die” was\n\n\n\n\n21   Hazel Biggs, “Euthanasia, Death with Dignity and the Law”, Hart Publishing (2001), at page 12\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_534\">                                                         33</span>\n\f                                                                                                         PART E\n\n\nmorally acceptable while active euthanasia or “killing” was not.22 Even though\n\nhis paper did not change the prevalence of this distinction at the time it was\n\npublished, it paved the way by providing credibility for arguments to legalise\n\nassisted suicide in the 1990s. In what he calls the ‘Equivalence Thesis’,\n\nRachels states “there is no morally important difference between killing and\n\nletting die; if one is permissible (or objectionable), then so is the other and to\n\nthe same degree.”23 He does not offer a view on whether the practice of\n\neuthanasia is acceptable or not. His central thesis is that both active and\n\npassive euthanasia are morally equivalent- either both are acceptable or both\n\nare not. Reichenbach for instance, asks: Supposing all else is equal, can a\n\nmoral judgment about euthanasia be made on the basis of it being active or\n\npassive alone?24. The ‘Equivalence thesis’ postulates that if a doctor lets a\n\npatient die (commonly understood as passive euthanasia) for humane\n\nreasons, he is in the same moral position as if he decided to kill the patient by\n\ngiving a lethal injection (commonly understood as active euthanasia) for\n\nhumane reasons.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_553\">\n\n38      The correctness of this precept may be questioned by pointing out that\n\nthere is a qualitative difference between a positive medical intervention (such\n\nas a lethal injection) which terminates life and a decision to not put a patient\n\non artificial life support, which will not artificially prolong life. The former brings\n\n22 James Rachels, “Active and Passive Euthanasia”, New England Journal of Medicine (January 9, 1975), at\n page 78-80\n23 James Rachels, End of Life: Euthanasia and Morality (Oxford University Press, 1986)\n24 Bruce R.

The latter does not delay the end of life beyond\n\nits natural end point. But, if the decision to proceed with euthanasia is the right\n\none based on compassion and the humanitarian impulse to reduce pain and\n\nsuffering, then the method used is not in itself important. Moreover, it is\n\nargued that passive euthanasia often involves more suffering since simply\n\nwithholding treatment means that the patient may take longer to die and thus\n\nsuffer more. Passive euthanasia may become questionable where the\n\nwithholding or withdrawal of medical intervention may lead to a condition of\n\npain and suffering, often a lingering and cruel death. The avoidance of\n\nsuffering, which is the object and purpose of euthanasia, may hence not be\n\nthe result of passive euthanasia and the converse may result. Besides raising\n\ntroubling moral questions – especially where it is non-voluntary, it questions\n\nthe efficacy of passive euthanasia. Moreover, it raises a troubling issue of the\n\nvalidity of the active-passive divide.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_554\">\n\n39         The moral and legal validity of the active-passive distinction based on\n\nthe exculpation of omissions has been criticised. One of the reasons for the\n\nexculpation of omissions is based on the idea that our duty not to harm people\n\nis generally stricter than our duty to help them.25 James Rachels offers a\n\ncompelling counter-argument to the argument that killing someone is a\n\nviolation of our duty not to do harm, whereas letting someone die is merely a\n\nfailure to help. He argues that our duty to help people is less stringent than the\n\n\n25   James Rachels (Supra note 23), at pages 101-120\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_536\">                                                       35</span>\n\f                                                                                                               PART E\n\n\nduty not to harm them only in cases where it would be very difficult to help\n\nthem or require a great amount of effort or sacrifice. However, when we think\n\nof cases where it would be relatively simple to help someone and there would\n\nbe no great personal sacrifice required, the morally justifiable response would\n\nbe different. He provides a hypothetical example of a child drowning in a\n\nbathtub, anyone standing next to the tub would have a strict moral duty to help\n\nthe child.26 Due to the equation between the child and the person standing\n\nnext to the bathtub (the proximity may be in terms of spatial distance or\n\nrelationship) the “alleged asymmetry” between the duty to help and the duty\n\nnot to do harm vanishes. A person standing next to bathtub would have no\n\ndefence to say that this was merely a failure to help and did not violate the\n\nduty to do no harm. In cases of euthanasia since the patient is close at hand\n\nand it is within the professional skills of the medical practitioner to keep him\n\nalive, the alleged asymmetry has little relevance. The distinction is rendered\n\nirrelevant even in light of the duty of care that doctors owe to their patients.\n\nAgainst the background of the duty to care, the moral and legal status of not\n\nsaving a life due to failure to provide treatment, can be the same as actively\n\ntaking that life.27 A doctor who knowingly allows a patient who could be saved\n\nto bleed to death might be accused of murder and medical negligence. The\n\nnature of the doctor-patient relationship which is founded on the doctor’s duty\n\nof care towards the patient necessitates that omissions on the doctor’s part\n\nwill also be penalised. When doctors take off life support, they can foresee\n26   Ibid\n27   Len Doyal and Lesley Doyal, “Why Active Euthanasia and Physician Assisted Suicide Should Be Legalised  If\n     Death Is in a Patient’s Best Interest Then Death Constitutes a Moral Good”, British Medical Journal (2001), at\n     pages 1079–1080.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_555\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_537\">                                                         36</span>\n\f                                                                                                            PART E\n\n\nthat death will be the outcome even though the timing of the death cannot be\n\ndetermined. Thus, what must be deemed to be morally and legally important\n\nmust not be the emotionally appealing distinction between omission and\n\ncommission but the justifiability or otherwise of the clinical outcome. Indeed,\n\nthe distinction between omission and commission may be of little value in\n\nsome healthcare settings.28\n\n\n\n40      This distinction leads to the result that even though euthanasia is\n\ngrounded in compassion and to relieve the patient of suffering, only certain\n\ntypes of deaths can be lawful. If active euthanasia amounts to “killing”, the\n\noperation of criminal law can lead to medical practitioners being exposed to\n\nthe indignity of criminal prosecutions and punishments.29 While passive\n\neuthanasia can appear to save the dignity of medical practitioners, it is\n\nperhaps at the expense of the patient’s dignity.30\n\n\n\n41      A recent article by Rohini Shukla in the Indian Journal of Medical Ethics\n\n(2016) points out two major flaws in Aruna Shanbaug regarding the\n\ndistinction between active and passive euthanasia.31 First, it fails to prioritise\n\nthe interest of the patient and is preoccupied with the effect of euthanasia on\n\neveryone but the patient, and second, that it does not distinguish between the\n\nterms “withholding and withdrawing and uses them interchangeably.”\n\n28 Ibid\n29 Hazel Biggs (Supra note 21), at Page 162\n30 Ibid\n31 Rohini Shukla, “Passive Euthanasia in India: a critique”, Indian Journal of Medical Ethics (Jan-Mar 2016), at\n\n   pages 35-38\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_538\">                                                      37</span>\n\f                                                                                PART E\n\n\nThroughout the above judgment, the words “withholding” and “withdrawing”\n\nare used interchangeably. However, the difference between the two is\n\nrelevant to the distinction between what is ‘active’ and ‘passive’ as act and\n\nomission. Withholding life support implies that crucial medical intervention is\n\nrestrained or is not provided – an act of omission on the part of the doctor.\n\nWithdrawing life support implies suspending medical intervention that was\n\nalready in use to sustain the patient’s life- an act of commission. If the basis of\n\ndistinction between active and passive euthanasia is that in passive\n\neuthanasia the doctor only passively commits acts of omission, while in active\n\neuthanasia the doctor commits acts of commission then withdrawing medical\n\ntreatment is an act of commission and therefore amounts to active euthanasia.\n\n\n\nIn both these cases, the doctor is aware that his/her commissions or\n\nomissions will in all likelihood lead to the patient’s death. However, in passive\n\neuthanasia death may not be the only consequence and the suffering that\n\npassive euthanasia often entails such as suffocation to death or starvation till\n\ndeath, raises the question of whether passive euthanasia, in such\n\ncircumstances, militates against the idea of death with dignity – the very basis\n\nof legalising euthanasia.32 Shukla’s criticism needs careful attention since it\n\nraises profound questions about the doctor-patient relationship and the\n\nefficacy of the distinction in the context of death with dignity. If the divide\n\nbetween active-passive is questioned, should both forms be disallowed or, in\n\n\n32   Ibid\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_539\">                                        38</span>\n\f                                                                                PART E\n\n\nconverse should both be allowed?

Instead the court made an analogy (perhaps\n\nincorrect) between a doctor conducting passive euthanasia and a person who\n\nwatches a building burning:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_406\">            “An important idea behind this distinction is that in passive\n            euthanasia, the doctors are not actively killing anyone; they\n            are simply not saving him.

If one rushes into a\n            burning building and carries someone out to safety, he will\n            probably be called a hero. But, if someone sees a burning\n            building and people screaming for help, and he stands on the\n            sidelines – whether out of fear for his own safety, or the belief\n            that an inexperienced and ill-equipped person like himself\n            would only get in the way of the professional firefighters, or\n            whatever – if one does nothing, few would judge him for his\n            action. One would surely not be prosecuted for homicide\n            (Atleast, not unless one started the fire in the first place)…[T]\n            here can be no debate about passive euthanasia: You cannot\n            persecute someone for failing to save a life.

The\n\nvalue of human life “resides in meeting a particular “quality” threshold”, above\n\nwhich the dignity of life would be “worthwhile”.

The separation of religion from morality and ethics does not\n\nnecessarily mean a rejection of religion, but that the doctrine of “sanctity of\n\nlife” must be accepted or rejected on its merits, by religious and non-religious\n\npeople alike. The value of life is not the value that it has for God or the value\n\nthat it may have from any religious perspective. The truth of moral judgments\n\nand exercising reason to decide what is right and wrong does not depend on\n\nthe truth of theological claims. The value of life is the value that it has for the\n\nhuman beings who are subjects of lives. Thus, the value of life must be\n\nunderstood from the perspective of the person who will be harmed by the loss,\n\nthe subject of life.

If the point of the rule\n\nagainst killing is the protection of lives, then we must acknowledge that in\n\nsome cases killing does not involve the destruction of “life” in the sense that\n\nlife is sought to be protected by law. For example, a person in an irreversible\n\ncoma or suffering a serious terminal illness is alive in a strictly biological sense\n\nbut is no longer able to live life in a way that may give meaning to this\n\nbiological existence. The rule against killing protects individuals that have lives\n\nand not merely individuals who are alive. When an individual is alive only to\n\nthe extent of being conscious in the most rudimentary sense, the capacity to\n\nexperience pleasure and pain (if any) does not necessarily have value if that is\n\nthe only capacity one has.

The second position represents the\n                 view of some fundamentalists, namely, that to uphold the\n                 sanctity of life value requires prohibition of euthanasia, but\n                 capital punishment is justified on the grounds that this\n                 punishment is deserved and just according to God&#x27;s law. The\n                 third position is that of some conservatives, who see capital\n                 punishment as a fit penalty on the basis that one can forfeit\n                 one&#x27;s life through a very serious crime, but that one can also\n                 consent to the taking of one&#x27;s own life in the form of\n                 euthanasia. The fourth view is that of some civil libertarians,\n                 that one can consent to the taking of one&#x27;s own life but cannot\n                 take that of others. Through such analyses, one can see\n                 where the various groups agree with each other and\n                 disagree. For example, the true pro-life persons and the\n                 fundamentalists agree with each other in being against\n                 euthanasia, and some conservatives and civil libertarians\n                 agree with each other in arguing for the availability of\n                 euthanasia. On the other hand, the true pro-life and civil\n                 libertarians join in their views in being against capital\n                 punishment, whereas the fundamentalists and some\n                 conservatives agree that this is acceptable.”77\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_579\">74 Margaret A.

The latter stem\n                  from a quality of life view and, linked to that, the possibility of\n                  choosing the time and place of one’s own death. The\n                  possibility of agency as a central element in what it means to\n                  be human is premised on the notion of human freedom, and\n                  freedom implies a number of different elements. These\n                  include a simple freedom to be left alone with one’s life, as\n                  well as a positive freedom to become what we have it within\n                  ourselves to be. Such freedom then entails further\n                  conceptions of autonomy, emancipation, and flourishing,\n                  insofar as human life reflects the potentialities in human\n                  being. The ability to choose one’s own death reflects many of\n                  these aspects of human freedom, from the simple sense that\n                  one should be left alone to do what one likes with one’s life to\n                  the more complex sense that an autonomous life would\n                  include amongst its components control over one’s death,\n                  and then on to the sense—that is surely there in the term\n                  ‘euthanasia’ (a ‘good death’)—that a flourishing life is one in\n                  which one is genuinely able to register the time to go.

His parents wanted him\n\nto undergo experimental treatment known as nucleoside which was available\n\nin the USA and raised a large amount of money to enable him to travel there.\n\nHowever, the doctors at the hospital in London who were treating him did not\n\nthink it was in his caregiver to have this treatment as instead they believed his\n\ncaregiver demanded that his life-support be withdrawn as they considered the\n\ntreatment to be futile. Due to the conflicting views between the parents and\n\nthe doctors, the core issue to be decided i.e. whether it was in the best\n\ninterest of the child to received further treatment had to be answered by the\n\nCourt. The case went through the judicial system- including the High Court,\n\nthe Supreme Court, the ECHR and finally back to the High Court, which on the\n\nbasis of medical reports concluded that it was not in the child’s caregiver to\n\nhave further treatment and passed an order permitting the doctors to allow\n\nCharlie to die.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_594\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_564\">102</span>\n  Great Ormond Street Hospital v.

That is, they\n                 possess dignity, or excellence, in virtue of the kind of being\n                 they are; and this essential dignity can be used summarily to\n                 express why it is impermissible, for example, intentionally to\n                 kill human beings: to do so is to act against their dignity.”111\n\n\n\nThe other interpretation of dignity is by the supporters of euthanasia. 112 For\n\nthem, right to lead a healthy life also includes leaving the world in a peaceful\n\nand dignified manner. Living with dignity, in this view, means the right to live a\n\nmeaningful life having certain quality.

In some\n                    cases, this overlaps with the incurability of the disease. In\n                    others, it may not. Costly medication and intervention is often\n                    withdrawn as the first step of this passive euthanasia process.\n                    Sometimes patients are &#x27;transferred&#x27; to smaller (read\n                    cheaper) institutions or even their homes, with the tacit\n                    understanding that this will hasten the inevitable. If a third\n                    party is funding the patient&#x27;s treatment, chances are that the\n                    intervention and support will continue. Shocking and arbitrary\n                    as this may sound, this is the reality that needs flagging\n                    because it is relevant to the proposed legitimization of\n                    passive euthanasia. In a system where out-of pocket payment\n                    is the norm and healthcare costs are booming, there has to\n                    be a way of differentiating a plea made on genuine medical\n                    grounds from one that might be an attempt to avoid financial\n                    ruin.”141\n\n\n\nRao (2011) has observed:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_453\">                    “In the absence of adequate medical insurance, specialised\n                    treatments like ventilator support, kidney dialysis, and\n                    expensive lifesaving drugs administered in private hospitals\n                    can turn middle-class families into virtual paupers.

The criticism is that as a matter of substance, there is no valid\n\ndistinguishing basis between active and passive euthanasia. The criticism takes\n\none of two forms: either both should be recognised or neither should be\n\nallowed. The view that passive euthanasia involves an omission while active\n\neuthanasia involves a positive act is questioned on the ground that the\n\nwithdrawal of artificial life support (as an incident of passive euthanasia)\n\nrequires a positive act. While noticing this criticism, it is necessary to distinguish\n\nbetween active and passive euthanasia in terms of the underlying constitutional\n\nprinciples as well as in relation to the exercise of judicial power. Passive\n\neuthanasia – whether in the form of withholding or withdrawing treatment – has\n\nthe effect of removing, or as the case may be, not providing supportive\n\ntreatment.

Hence, it is only Parliament which can in its\n\nlegislative wisdom decide whether active euthanasia should be permitted.\n\nPassive euthanasia on the other hand would not implicate a criminal offence\n\nsince the decision to withhold or withdraw artificial life support after taking into\n\naccount the best interest of the patient would not constitute an illegal omission\n\nprohibited by law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_617\">\n\n94        Moreover, it is necessary to make a distinction between active and\n\npassive euthanasia in terms of the incidents of judicial power.

This is\n\nbrought out in the application of the doctrine of ‘double effect’. The Stanford\n\nEncyclopedia of Philosophy elucidates the position thus:\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_597\">                                              88</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_483\">\f                                                                                                  PART I\n\n\n                  “The doctrine (or principle) of double effect is often invoked to\n                  explain the permissibility of an action that causes a serious\n                  harm, such as the death of a human being, as a side effect of\n                  promoting some good end. According to the principle of\n                  double effect, sometimes it is permissible to cause a harm as\n                  a side effect (or “double effect”) of bringing about a good\n                  result even though it would not be permissible to cause such\n                  a harm as a means to bringing about the same good end.”147\n\n\n\n\nIt has been observed further:\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_484\">                  “A doctor who intends to hasten the death of a terminally ill\n                  patient by injecting a large dose of morphine would act\n                  impermissibly because he intends to bring about the patient&#x27;s\n                  death. However, a doctor who intended to relieve the patient&#x27;s\n                  pain with that same dose and merely foresaw the hastening\n                  of the patient&#x27;s death would act permissibly.”148\n\n\n\n98        A distinction arises between active and passive euthanasia from the\n\nprovisions of the Penal Code. Active euthanasia involves an intention to cause\n\nthe death of the patient. Mens rea requires a guilty mind; essentially an intent\n\nto cause harm or injury. Passive euthanasia does not embody an intent to\n\ncause death. A doctor may withhold life support to ensure that the life of a\n\npatient who is in the terminal stage of an incurable illness or in a permanent\n\nvegetative state, is not prolonged artificially. The decision to do so is not\n\nfounded upon an intent to cause death but to allow the life of the patient to\n\ncontinue till and cease at the end of its natural term. Placing such a person on\n\nlife support would have been an intervention in the natural process of death. A\n\ndecision not to prolong life by artificial means does not carry an intention to\n\ncause death. The crucial element in Section 299 is provided by the expression\n147    “Doctrine of Double Effect”, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (July 28, 2004), available at\n       https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/double-effect/\n148   Ibid\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_598\">                                                   89</span>\n\f                                                                                    PART I\n\n\n“causes death”. In a case involving passive euthanasia, the affliction of the\n\npatient is not brought about either by an act or omission of the doctor. There is\n\nneither an animus nor an intent to cause death. The creation of the condition\n\nof the patient is outside the volition of the doctor and has come about without\n\na covert or overt act by the doctor. The decision to withhold medical\n\nintervention is not intended to cause death but to prevent pain, suffering and\n\nindignity to a human being who is in the end stage of a terminal illness or of a\n\nvegetative state with no reasonable prospect of cure. Placing a patient on\n\nartificial life support would, in such a situation, merely prolong the agony of the\n\npatient. Hence, a decision by the doctor based on what is in the best interest\n\nof the patient precludes an intent to cause death. Similarly, withdrawal of\n\nartificial life support is not motivated by an intent to cause death. What a\n\nwithdrawal of life support does is not to artificially prolong life. The end of life is\n\nbrought about by the inherent condition of the patient. Thus, both in a case of\n\na withdrawal of life supporting intervention and withholding it, the law protects\n\na bona fide assessment of a medical professional. There being no intent to\n\ncause death, the act does not constitute either culpable homicide or murder.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_620\">Moreover, the doctor does not inflict a bodily injury. The condition of a patient\n\nis on account of a factor independent of the doctor and is not an outcome of\n\nhis or her actions. Death emanates from the pre-existing medical condition of\n\nthe patient which enables life to chart a natural course to its inexorable end.\n\nThe law protects a decision which has been made in good faith by a medical\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_599\">                                          90</span>\n\f                                                                                   PART I\n\n\nprofessional not to prolong the indignity of a life placed on artificial support in a\n\nsituation where medical knowledge indicates a point of no return. Neither the\n\nact nor the omission is done with the knowledge that it is likely to cause death.\n\nThis is for the reason that the likelihood of death is not occasioned by the act\n\nor omission but by the medical condition of the patient. When a doctor takes a\n\nconsidered decision in the case of a patient in a terminal stage of illness or in\n\na permanently vegetative state, not to provide artificial life support, the law\n\ndoes not attribute to the doctor the knowledge that it is likely to cause death.\n\n\n\n99    <a href=\"/doc/159118666/\" id=\"a_389\">Section 43</a> of the Penal Code defines the expression illegal to mean\n\n“…everything which is an offence or which is prohibited by law, or which\n\nfurnishes ground in a civil action”. Withdrawing life support to a person in a\n\npermanently vegetative state or in a terminal stage of illness is not ‘prohibited\n\nby law’. Such an act would also not fall outside the purview of <a href=\"/doc/112618053/\" id=\"a_390\">Section 92</a> for\n\nthe reason that there is no intentional causing of death or attempt to cause\n\ndeath. Where a decision to withdraw artificial life support is made in the\n\ncaregiver of the patient, it fulfils the duty of care required from a doctor\n\ntowards the patient. Where a doctor has acted in fulfilment of a duty of care\n\nowed to the patient, the medical judgment underlying the decision protects it\n\nfrom a charge of illegality. Such a decision is not founded on an intention to\n\ncause death or on the knowledge that it is likely to cause death. An act done\n\nin pursuance of the duty of care owed by the doctor to a patient is not\n\nprohibited by law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_621\">\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_600\">                                         91</span>\n\f                                                                              PART I\n\n\n100   In a situation where passive euthanasia is non-voluntary, there is an\n\nadditional protection which is also available in circumstances which give rise\n\nto the application of <a href=\"/doc/112618053/\" id=\"a_391\">Section 92</a>.

The intent in passive euthanasia\n\nis not to cause death. A decision not to prolong life beyond its natural span by\n\nwithholding or withdrawing artificial life support or medical intervention cannot\n\nbe equated with an intent to cause death. The element of good faith, coupled\n\nwith an objective assessment of the caregiver of the patient would protect the\n\nmedical professional in a situation where a bona fide decision has been taken\n\nnot to prolong the agony of a human being in a terminal or vegetative state by\n\na futile medical intervention.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_622\">\n\n101   In 2006, the Law Commission of India submitted its 196th Report titled\n\n“Medical Treatment to Terminally Ill Patients (Protection of Patients and\n\nMedical Practitioners)”.

It can presumably apply to both the situation in\n                 which a person with a terminal disease lapses into the final\n                 stage of his illness and also the situation in which a victim of a\n                 serious accident deteriorates into a state of indefinite\n                 vegetated animation…”\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_630\">107     The principles of patient autonomy and consent are the foundation of\n\nadvance medical directives.

Common law\n                 holds that patients with the capacity to give consent are also\n                 competent to refuse or withhold consent, “even if a refusal\n                 may risk personal injury to health or even lead to premature\n                 death”.

They\n\ncover three conditions: (i) a terminal condition; (ii) a persistently unconscious\n\ncondition; and (iii) an end-stage condition.\n\n\n\n\n109   A terminal condition is an incurable or irreversible condition which\n\neven with the administration of life-sustaining treatment will result in death in\n\nthe foreseeable future. A persistently unconscious condition is an\n\nirreversible condition, in which thought and awareness of self and environment\n\nare absent. An end-stage condition is a condition caused by injury, disease\n\nor illness which results in severe and permanent deterioration indicated by\n\nincompetency and complete physical dependency for which treatment of the\n\nirreversible condition would be medically ineffective.\n\n\n\n\n110   The reason for recognising an advance directive is based on individual\n\nautonomy. As an autonomous person, every individual has a constitutionally\n\nrecognised right to refuse medical treatment. The right not to accept medical\n\ntreatment is essential to liberty. Medical treatment cannot be thrust upon an\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_609\">                                             100</span>\n\f                                                                              PART J\n\n\nindividual, however, it may have been conceived in the interest of the individual.\n\nThe reasons which may lead a person in a sound state of mind to refuse\n\nmedical treatment are inscrutable. Those decisions are not subject to scrutiny\n\nand have to be respected by the law as an essential attribute of the right of the\n\nindividual to have control over the body. The state cannot compel an unwilling\n\nindividual to receive medical treatment. While an individual cannot compel a\n\nmedical professional to provide a particular treatment (this being in the realm of\n\nprofessional medical judgment), it is equally true that the individual cannot be\n\ncompelled to undergo medical intervention. The principle of sanctity of life thus\n\nrecognises the fundamental liberty of every person to control his or her body\n\nand as its incident, to decline medical treatment. The ability to take such a\n\ndecision is an essential element of the privacy of the being. Privacy also\n\nensures that a decision as personal as whether or not to accept medical\n\ntreatment lies exclusively with the individual as an autonomous being. The\n\nreasons which impel an individual to do so are part of the privacy of the\n\nindividual. The mental processes which lead to decision making are equally\n\npart of the constitutionally protected right to privacy.\n\n\n\n111   Advance directives are founded on the principle that an individual whose\n\nstate of mind is not clouded by an affliction which prevents him or her from\n\ntaking decisions is entitled to decide whether to accept or not accept medical\n\nintervention. If a decision can be made for the present, when the individual is in\n\na sound state of mind, such a person should be allowed to decide the course of\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_610\">                                         101</span>\n\f                                                                                PART J\n\n\naction which should be followed in the future if he or she were to be in a\n\nsituation which affects the ability to take decisions. If a decision on whether or\n\nnot to receive medical treatment is valid for the present such a decision must be\n\nequally valid when it is intended to operate in the future. Advance directives are,\n\nin other words, grounded in a recognition by the law of the importance of\n\nconsent as an essential attribute of personal liberty. It is the consensual nature\n\nof the act underlying the advance directive which imparts sanctity to it in future\n\nin the same manner as a decision in the present on whether or not to accept\n\nmedical treatment.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_632\">\n\n\n112   When a patient is brought for medical treatment in a state of mind in\n\nwhich he or she is deprived of the mental capacity to make informed choices,\n\nthe medical professional needs to determine the line of treatment. One line of\n\nenquiry, which seeks to protect patient autonomy is how the individual would\n\nhave made a decision if he or she had decision-making capacity. This is\n\ncalled the substituted judgment standard. An advance medical directive is\n\nconstrued as a facilitative mechanism in the application of the substituted\n\njudgment standard, if it provides to the physician a communication by the\n\npatient (when she or he was in a fit state of mind) of the desire for or restraint\n\non being provided medical treatment in future.\n\n\n\n113   Conceptually, there is a second standard, which is the caregiver\n\nstandard.

In a subset of\n            cases, a substituted judgment can implement an actual earlier\n            decision of the patient, made in anticipation of the current\n            circumstances; this is known as precedent autonomy.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_501\">            The Caregiver standard:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_502\">            The surrogate is to decide based on what, in general, would\n            be good for the patient.

This legal standard\n            has traditionally assumed a quite generic view of interests,\n            asking what a “reasonable” person would want under the\n            circumstances and focusing on general goods such as\n            freedom from pain, comfort, restoration and/or development\n            of the patient’s physical and mental capacities. This is\n            because the Caregiver standard has mainly been employed\n            when there is little or no information about the patient’s\n            specific values and preferences. However, the concept of\n            caregiver is simply the concept of what is best for the person.\n            There is no reason why, in principle, the Caregiver judgment\n            could not be as nuanced and individual as the best theory of\n            well-being dictates.”\n\n\nThe difference between these two standards is that the first seeks to\n\nreconstruct the subjective point of view of the patient. The second allows for\n\n“a more generic view of interests”, without having to rely on the “idiosyncratic\n\nvalues and preference of the patient in question”.\n</blockquote>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_612\">                                           103</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_503\">\f                                                                                 PART J\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_633\">114   The Encyclopaedia explains that the “orthodox view” contained the\n\nfollowing ordering of priorities:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_504\">            “1.

Absent an advance directive, apply the Substituted\n                Judgment standard based on available information about\n                the patient’s past decisions and values.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_506\">             3. If you cannot apply the Substituted Judgment standard –\n                either because the patient has never been competent or\n                because information about the patient’s former wishes and\n                values is unavailable – use the Caregiver standard.”\n\n\n\nThe above ordering of priorities in the orthodox view has been questioned. In\n\nprioritising advance directives and substituted judgments, the orthodox view\n\n“overlooks the possibility that the earlier competent self and the current\n\nincompetent self may have conflicting interests”. Advance directives and the\n\nsubstituted judgment standard were propounded to deal with afflictions such\n\nas a persistent vegetative state where the interests of the patient in such a\n\nstate are not potentially different from what they used to be. The Stanford\n\nEncyclopaedia, however, notes that a loss of decision-making capacity may\n\ngive rise to less drastic conditions in which the presently incompetent patient\n\nmay have developed “powerful new interests” in a new phase of life. Patients\n\nfacing Alzheimer’s or dementia face progressive mental deterioration. When\n\nsuch a patient was still in a competent state of mind, she may have regarded\n\na state of dementia to be degrading. However, as the disease progresses,\n\nthe interests of the patient change and her life may be enriched by the simple\n\nactivities of life. The patient may cease to identify with his or her intellect and\n\nrevisit an earlier desire not to prolong life. The Stanford Encyclopaedia states\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_613\">                                            104</span>\n\f                                                                                 PART J\n\n\nthat in such an eventuality, “the conflict is between the autonomy of the earlier\n\nself and the well-being of the current self”.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_634\">115   One way of seeking a philosophical resolution is to postulate that the\n\nformer self and its interests will have priority, or a “special authority” over the\n\ncurrent self. Such an approach prioritises autonomy over beneficence. This\n\nline of approach is, however, not free of difficulty. A patient may have lost the\n\nability to take complex decisions. Yet the treating physician may not have “a\n\nlicense to discount the current well-being of the individual in favour of what\n\nmattered to him earlier”. This illustration emphasises the potential conflict\n\nbetween a pure application of the substituted judgment standard and the\n\ncaregiver standard. The former seeks to preserve individual autonomy at all\n\ncosts. The latter juxtaposes the role of the medical professional in determining\n\nwhat is in the best interest of the patient. The best interest standard is hence\n\nfounded on the principle that a patient who has progressed from a competent\n\nmental state to an increasing lack of mental capacity faces a change of\n\npersonal identity. An autonomous decision suited to an earlier identity may\n\nnot always be a valid rationale for determining the course of action in respect\n\nof a new identity which a patient acquires in the course of illness:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_507\">             “According to the threshold views, the earlier self has\n             authority to determine the overall interests of the patient\n             because the current self has lost crucial abilities that would\n             allow it to ground these overall interests anew. This picture\n             assumes that the earlier and current self are stages in the life\n             of one entity, so that, despite the talk of local interests\n             associated with each life-stage, there is an underlying\n             continuity of interests between the two.

The lack of identity between\n             the earlier and current self undercuts the authority of the\n             former over the latter.”\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_635\">116   In such a situation the doctor’s duty to care assumes significance. The\n\nrelationship between a doctor and her patient with an evolving mental\n\ncondition needs a balance between the desires of the patient in a different\n\nmental state and the needs of the patient in the present condition. Neither can\n\nbe ignored in preference to the other. The first recognises the patient as an\n\nautonomous individual whose desires and choices must be respected by law\n\nand medicine. The desire not to be subject to endless medical intervention,\n\nwhen one’s condition of mind or body have reached an irreversible state is a\n\nprofound reflection of the value to be left alone. Constitutional jurisprudence\n\nprotects it as part of the right to privacy. On the other hand, the need to\n\nprocure the dignity of the individual in a deteriorating and irreversible state of\n\nbody or mind is as crucial to the value of existence. The doctor must respect\n\nthe former while being committed as a professional to protect the latter.\n\n\n\n117   Human experience suggests that there is a chasm of imponderables\n\nwhich divide the present from the future. Such a divide may have a bearing on\n\nwhether and if so, the extent to which an advance directive should bind in the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_615\">                                           106</span>\n\f                                                                             PART J\n\n\nfuture. As stated above, the sanctity of an advance directive is founded upon\n\nthe expression of the will of an individual who is in a sound state of mind when\n\nthe directive is executed. Underlying the consensual character of the\n\ndeclaration is the notion of the consent being informed. Undoubtedly, the\n\nreasons which have weighed with an individual in executing the advance\n\ndirective cannot be scrutinized (in the absence of situations such as fraud or\n\ncoercion which implicate the very basis of the consent). However, an individual\n\nwho expresses the desire not to be subjected to a particular line of treatment in\n\nthe future, should she or he be ailing in the future, does so on an assessment of\n\ntreatment options available when the directive is executed. For instance, a\n\ndecision not to accept chemotherapy in the event that the individual is detected\n\nwith cancer in the future, is based on today’s perception of the trauma that may\n\nbe suffered by the patient through that treatment. Advances in medical\n\nknowledge between the date of the execution of the document and an uncertain\n\nfuture date when the individual may possibly confront treatment for the disease\n\nmay have led to a re-evaluation by the person of the basis on which a desire\n\nwas expressed several years earlier. Another fundamental issue is whether the\n\nindividual can by means of an advance directive compel the withholding of basic\n\ncare such as hydration and nourishment in the future. Protecting the individual\n\nfrom pain and suffering as well as the indignity of debility may similarly raise\n\nimportant issues. Advance directives may hence conceivably raise ethical\n\nissues of the extent to which the perception of the individual who executes it\n\nmust prevail in priority to the best interest of the patient.\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_616\">                                         107</span>\n\f                                                                                PART J\n\n\n118   The substituted judgment standard basically seeks to determine what the\n\nindividual would have decided. This gives primacy to the autonomy of the\n\nindividual. On the other hand, as seen earlier, the best interest standard is\n\nbased on the principle of beneficence. There is an evident tension between\n\nthese two standards. What an individual would decide as an autonomous entity\n\nis a matter of subjective perception. What is in the best interest of the patient is\n\nan objective standard: objective, with the limitation that even experts differ. The\n\nimportance of an advance directive lies in bringing to the fore the primacy of\n\nindividual choice. Such a directive ensures that the individual retains control\n\nover the manner in which the body is treated. It allows the individual to decide\n\nnot to accept artificial treatment which would prolong life in the terminal stage of\n\nan ailment or in a vegetative state. In doing so, recognition is granted to the\n\neffect of the advance directive upon the happening of a contingency in the\n\nfuture, just as the individual would in the present have a right to refuse medical\n\ntreatment. The advance directive is an indicator to medical professionals of the\n\nunderlying desire of the person executing it.\n\n\n\n119   In a society such as ours where family ties have an important place in\n\nsocial existence, advance directives also provide a sense of solace to the\n\nfamily. Decisions such as whether to withhold or withdraw artificial life saving\n\ntreatment are difficult for families to take. Advance directives provide moral\n\nauthority for the family of the patient that the decision which has been taken to\n\nwithdraw or withhold artificial life support is in accord with the stated desire of\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_617\">                                       108</span>\n\f                                                                                PART J\n\n\nthe patient expressed earlier. But the ethical concerns which have been referred\n\nto earlier may warrant a nuanced application of the principle. The circumstances\n\nwhich have been adverted to earlier indicate that the decision on whether to\n\nwithhold or withdraw medical treatment should be left to a competent body\n\ncomprising of, but not restricted to medical professionals. Assigning a\n\nsupervisory role to such a body is also necessary in order to protect against the\n\npossibility of abuse and the dangers surrounding the misuse of an advance\n\ndirective. One cannot be unmindful of prevailing social reality in the country.\n\nHence, it is necessary to ensure that an advance directive is not utilized as a\n\nsubterfuge to fulfil unlawful or unethical purposes such as facilitating a\n\nsuccession to property.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_636\">\n\n120   The view which this judgment puts forth is that the recognition of advance\n\ndirectives as part of a regime of constitutional jurisprudence is an essential\n\nattribute of the right to life and personal liberty under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_398\">Article 21.</a> That right\n\ncomprehends dignity as its essential foundation. Quality of life is integral to\n\ndignity.

Such a choice expressed at a point in time\n\nwhen the individual is in a sound and competent state of mind should have\n\nsanctity in the future if the individual were to cease to have the mental capability\n\nto take decisions and make choices. Yet, a balance between the application of\n\nthe substituted judgment standard and the best interest standard is necessary\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_618\">                                       109</span>\n\f                                                                                                         PART J\n\n\nas a matter of public interest.

English Law has\n\nrecognised the entitlement of an individual possessed of the ability to take\n\ndecisions to refuse medical treatment163. The law has had to confront\n\nproblems in applying this standard in difficult, practical situations. For\n\ninstance, in a judgment in Re B (Adult: Refusal of Medical Treatment)164, a\n\npatient who was suffering from tetraplegia declined to consent to artificial\n\nventilation. Though the patient was found initially to suffer from depression\n\nand to lack decision making capacity, subsequent evaluation found that she\n\nwas mentally competent. For a period of nine months, the hospital refused to\n\nrespect the wishes of the patient not to place her on artificial ventilation,\n\nnecessitating judicial intervention. When the case travelled to court, the\n\nPresident of the Family Division, Dame Butler-Sloss emphasised that “the\n\nright of the patient to demand cessation of treatment must prevail “over the\n\nnatural desire of the medical and nursing professions to try to keep her alive”.\n\nThe Judge recognised the serious danger of “a benevolent paternalism which\n\n\n\n\n162 “Are advance directives legally binding or simply the starting point for discussion on patients’ best interests?”,\n      BMJ (28 November 2009), Volume 339, page 1231\n163 Re T (Adult: Refusal of Treatment) [1942] 4 All ER 649; Re C (Adult: Refusal of Medical Treatment)[1994] 1\n\n    All ER 819; St George’s Healthcare NHS Trust v S [1998] 3 WLR 936\n164 [2002] 2 All ER 449\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_620\">                                                        111</span>\n\f                                                                                                             PART J\n\n\ndoes not embrace recognition of the personal autonomy of the severely\n\ndisabled patient”.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_639\">\n\n124        Commenting on the above decision, Elizabeth Wicks in her recently\n\npublished book titled “The State and The Body – Legal Regulation of\n\nBodily Autonomy”165 observes that:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_509\">                    “… the desire to preserve life is strong and choices to end life,\n                    especially in circumstances where the life is not without an\n                    element of quality, are often seen as swimming against a\n                    strong tide of the value of life.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_640\">125        In Re AK (Adult Patient) (Medical Treatment: Consent)166, Justice\n\nHughes (as he then was) in the High Court of Justice, reviewed the\n\nauthorities, and summarised the common law position thus:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_510\">                    “Accordingly, the first principle of law which I am satisfied is\n                    completely clear, is that in the case of an adult patient of full\n                    capacity his refusal to consent to treatment or care must in\n                    law be observed.

Individuals may not fully\n\nunderstand treatment options or recognize the consequences of certain\n\nchoices in the future. Sometimes, people change their minds after\n\nexpressing advance directives and forget to inform others. Another issue with\n\nadvance directives is that vague statements can make it difficult to understand\n\nthe course of action when a situation arises. For example, general statements\n\nrejecting &quot;heroic treatments&quot; are vague and do not indicate whether you want\n\na   particular   treatment   for   a   specific   situation   (such   as   antibiotics\n\nfor pneumonia after a severe stroke).          On the other hand, very specific\n\ndirectives for future care may not be useful when situations change in\n\nunexpected ways. New medical therapies may also have become available\n\nsince an advance directive was given. Thus, advance directives should be\n\nreviewed and revised regularly if feelings about certain issues change, so that\n\ncurrent wishes and decisions are always legally documented.\n\n\n\n139   An important facet which a regime of advanced care directives must\n\nfactor in, is the existence of variables which affect the process.             These\n\ninclude, in our society, institutional aspects such as the paucity of access to\n\npublicly funded Medicare, declining standards of professional ethics and the\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_638\">                                         126</span>\n\f                                                                                                           PART J\n\n\ninadequacy of institutional responses to the lack of professional accountability\n\nin the medical profession.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_662\">\n\n140     A report submitted in October 2017 by the American Bar Association’s\n\nCommission on Law and Ageing to the US Department of Health Services,\n\ndwelt on several variables which bear upon advance directives. The following\n\nobservations provide an insight:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_532\">                 “A good starting point in understanding this landscape is a\n                 realization that law and regulation are but one slice of the\n                 universe of variables that profoundly affect the experience of\n                 dying…\n\n                 …other key variables include institutional innovation, the role\n                 of financing systems, professional and public education and\n                 professional standards and guidelines.

Thus, the isolation of law and\n                 regulation as a strategy for behaviour change requires a\n                 sense of humility in establishing expectations, lest we\n                 overstate the influence of law in the human experience of\n                 dying…”203\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_663\">141     There are variables which “profoundly affect the experience of dying”\n\neven in a developed society. They provide a sobering reflection of the gulf\n\nwhich separates the needs of patients and the availability of services to the\n\npoor, in a society like ours with large impoverished strata. Patient autonomy\n\nmay mean little to the impoverished citizen. For marginalised groups in urban\n\nand rural India, even basic medical care is a distant reality. Advance directives\n\npostulate the availability of medical care. For, it is on the hypothesis of such\n\n\n  “Advance Directives And Advance Care Planning: Legal And Policy Issues”, U.S. Department of Health and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_639\">203</span>\n\nHuman Services (October 2007), available at https://aspe.hhs.gov/system/files/pdf/75366/adacplpi.pdf, at page 1\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_640\">                                                     127</span>\n\f                                                                                  PART J\n\n\ncare being available that the right to choose or refuse treatment is based. The\n\nstark reality in our society is that medical facilities are woefully inadequate.\n\nPrimary medical care is a luxury in many places. Public hospitals are\n\noverwhelmed by the gap between the demand for medical care and its supply.\n\nAdvance directives may have little significance to large segments of Indian\n\nsociety which are denied access to basic care. Advance directives also\n\nrequire an awareness of rights. The stark reality is that the average Indian is\n\ndeprived of even basic medical facilities in an environment where absence of\n\nrudimentary care is the norm. Moreover, absolute notions of patient autonomy\n\nneed to be evaluated in the context of the Indian social structure where bonds\n\nof family, religion and caste predominate. The immediate family and in many\n\nsituations, the larger unit of the extended family are caregivers. In the absence\n\nof a social security net, universal medical coverage and compulsory\n\ninsurance, it is the family to which a patient turns to in distress. Families\n\nbecome the caregivers, willingly or as a result of social conditioning, especially\n\nin the absence of resources and alternative institutional facilities. The views of\n\nthe family which are drawn by close bonds of kinship have to be factored into\n\nthe process. At the other end of the spectrum, rising costs of medical care in\n\nthe urban areas threaten to ruin the finances of a family when a member is\n\nstruck by a serious illness. To them, advance directives may provide a\n\nmeasure of assurance when a crucial decision as to whether to prolong\n\nartificial support in an irreversible medical situation is to be taken. The fact that\n\nthe patient had expressed a desire in the form of an advance directive\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_641\">                                        128</span>\n\f                                                                            PART K\n\n\nobviates a sense of moral guilt on the part of the caregivers, when the family\n\naccepts the doctors’ wisdom to withdraw or withhold artificial support. Another\n\nimportant variable which a regime of advance directives must bear in mind is\n\nthe danger of misuse. The regime of advance directives which is intended to\n\nsecure patient autonomy must contain safeguards against the greed of\n\navaricious relatives colluding with willing medical professionals. The\n\nsafeguards must be robust to obviate the dangers. The complexities of culture\n\nand of the social strata adverted to above only emphasise the wide diversity\n\nthat prevails within the country. Our solution must take into account the\n\ndiversity across the country.

Gian Kaur\n\n   does not conclusively rule on the validity of passive euthanasia. The two\n\n   Judge Bench decision in Aruna Shanbaug proceeds on an incorrect\n\n   perception of Gian Kaur. Moreover, Aruna Shanbaug has proceeded on\n\n   the basis of the act – omission distinction which suffers from incongruities\n\n   of a jurisprudential nature. Aruna Shanbaug has also not dwelt on the\n\n   intersection between criminal law and passive euthanasia, beyond\n\n   adverting to Sections 306 and 309 of the Penal Code. Aruna Shanbaug\n\n   has subordinated the interest of the patient to the interest of others\n\n   including the treating doctors and supporting caregivers. The underlying\n\n   basis of the decision in Aruna Shanbaug is flawed. Hence, it has become\n\n   necessary for this Court in the present reference to revisit the issues\n\n   raised and to independently arrive at a conclusion based on the\n\n   constitutional position;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_679\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_680\">(ix) While upholding the legality of passive euthanasia (voluntary and non-\n\n   voluntary) and in recognising the importance of advance directives, the\n\n   present judgment draws sustenance from the constitutional values of\n\n   liberty, dignity, autonomy and privacy. In order to lend assurance to a\n\n   decision taken by the treating doctor in good faith, this judgment has\n\n   mandated the setting up of committees to exercise a supervisory role and\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_646\">                                     133</span>\n\f                                                                                               PART K\n\n\n      function. Besides lending assurance to the decision of the treating doctors,\n\n      the setting up of such committees and the processing of a proposed\n\n      decision through the committee will protect the ultimate decision that is\n\n      taken from an imputation of a lack of bona fides;

In the ancient India, on &#x27;life&#x27; and &#x27;death&#x27; there is\n\nconsiderable   literature.   According   to   Hinduism,   life\n\nnever comes to an end. The soul never die although body\n\nmay decay. The soul is continuous and perpetual which is\n\nnot merely a biological identity, death is not the end\n\nof   life   but   only   a   transformation   of   a   body.   In\n\n“Bhagavad­gita”   Chapter   II   Verse   22   (as   translated   in\n\nEnglish), it is stated by Lord Krishna:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_713\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_548\">     &quot;22.As   a   man   shedding   worn­out   garments,\n     takes other new ones, likewise the embodied\n     soul,   casting   off   worn­out   bodies,   enters\n     into others that are new.”\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_714\">15. The death was never feared in ancient Indian culture\n\nand   mythology.   Death   was   treated   sometimes   a   means   to\n\nobtain liberation that is &#x27;moksha&#x27;. Every life is a gift\n\nof   God   and   sacred   and   it   has   to   be   protected   at   all\n\ncost. No person is bestowed with the right to end his or\n\nher   life.   However,   an   individual&#x27;s   act   of   discarding\n\nmortal   body   may   be   permissible   under   certain\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_663\">\f                                                                    13</span>\n\ncircumstances. In ancient Indian religion, sanctity was\n\nattached to a Yogi (a person who has mastered the art of\n\nregulating   his   involuntary   physical   and   mental\n\nfunctions,   at   will)   can   discard   his/her   mortal\n\ncoil(body)   through   the   process   of   higher   spiritual\n\npractices   called   yoga.     Such   state   was   known   as\n\n&#x27;Samadhi&#x27;.   But   there   was   no   concept   in   ancient\n\nIndia/mythology   of   putting   an   end   to   life   of   another\n\nhuman   being   which   was   always   regarded   as   crime   and\n\nagainst &#x27;dharma&#x27;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_715\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_716\">16.

The   concept   of   advance   medical   directive   is   also\n\ncalled   living   will   is   of   recent   origin,   which   gained\n\nrecognition in  latter part  of 20th  century. The advance\n\nmedical   directive   has   been   recognised   first   by   Statute\n\nin United States of America when in the year 1976, State\n\nof California passed “Natural Death Act”.  It is claimed\n\nthat 48 states out of 50 in the United States of America\n\nhave   enacted   their   own   laws   regarding   Patient’s   Rights\n\nand   advance   medical   directives.     Advance   medical\n\ndirective   is   a   mechanism   through   which   individual\n\nautonomy can be safeguarded in order to provide dignity\n\nin   dying.     As   noted   above,   the   Constitution   Bench   of\n\nthis   Court   in   the   case   of  <a href=\"/doc/217501/\" id=\"a_514\">Gian   Kaur</a>   (supra)  has   laid\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_752\">\f                                                                     82</span>\n\ndown   that   right   to   die   with   dignity   is   enshrined   in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_515\">Article   21</a>   of   the   Constitution.     It   is   to   be   noticed\n\nthat   advance   medical   directives   are   not   exclusively\n\nassociated with end of life decisions.   However, it is\n\nvital   to   ensure   that   form   of   an   advance   medical\n\ndirective   reflects   the   needs   of   its   author   and   is\n\nsufficiently   authoritative   and   practical   to   enable   its\n\nprovisions   to   be   upheld.     In   most   of   the   western\n\ncountries   advance   medical   directives   have   taken   a\n\nlegalistic form incorporating a formal declaration to be\n\nsigned   by   competent   witnesses.     The   laws   also   make\n\nprovisions   for   updating   confirmation   of   its\n\napplicability and revocation.  Protecting the individual\n\nautonomy is obviously the primary purpose of an advance\n\nmedical directive.   The right to decide one’s own fate\n\npre­supposes a capacity to do so.  The answer as to when\n\na particular advance medical directive becomes operative\n\nusually depends upon an assent of when its author is no\n\nlonger   competent   to   participate   in   medical   decision\n\nmaking.   The Black’s Law Dictionary defines the Advance\n\nMedical Directive as “a legal document explaining one’s\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_753\">\f                                                                  83</span>\n\nwishes   about   medical   treatment   if   one   becomes\n\nincompetent   or   unable   to   communicate”.     An   advance\n\nmedical directive is an individual’s advance exercise of\n\nhis   autonomy   on   the   subject   of   extent   of   medical\n\nintervention that he wishes to allow upon his own body\n\nat a future date, when he may not be in a position to\n\nspecify his wishes.   The purpose and object of advance\n\nmedical directive is to express the choice of a person\n\nregarding  medical  treatment   in   an  event   when   he   looses\n\ncapacity   to   take   a   decision.   Use   and   operation   of\n\nadvance medical directive is to confine only to a case\n\nwhen   person   becomes   incapacitated   to   take   an   informed\n\ndecision regarding his medical treatment.  So long as an\n\nindividual   can   take   an   informed   decision   regarding   his\n\nmedical   treatment,   there   is   no   occasion   to   look   into\n\nadvance   medical   directives.   A   person   has   unfettered\n\nright to change or cancel his advance medical directives\n\nlooking to the need of time and advancement in medical\n\nscience.  Hence, a person cannot be tied up or bound by\n\nhis instructions given at an earlier point of time.</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_824\">88.

84</span>\n\nlargely as a response to development in medicines.  Many\n\npeople   living   depending   on   machines   cause   great\n\nfinancial distress to the family with the cost of long\n\nterm   medical   treatment.    Advance   medical   directive   was\n\ndeveloped   as   a   means   to   restrict   the   kinds   of   medical\n\nintervention in event when one become incapacitated. The\n\nfoundation   for   seeking   direction   regarding   advance\n\nmedical   directive   is   extension   of   the   right   to   refuse\n\nmedical   treatment   and   the   right   to   die   with   dignity.\n\nWhen   a   competent   patient   has   right   to   take   a   decision\n\nregarding   medical   treatment,   with   regard   to   medical\n\nprocedure entailing right to die with dignity, the said\n\nright   cannot   be   denied   to   those   patients,   who   have\n\nbecome   incompetent   to  take   an  informed   decision   at   the\n\nrelevant time. The concept of advance medical directive\n\nhas gained ground to give effect to the rights of those\n\npatients, who at a  particular time are not able to take\n\nan   informed
