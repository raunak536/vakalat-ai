However, the petitioner alleges that the 1st\n\n                         respondent has now filed a maintenance case with false information.\n\n                         Under such circumstances, the petitioner has filed a petition in\n\n                         Cr.M.P.No.504 of 2025 requesting to appoint a Commissioner to\n\n                         collect blood samples from the petitioner and the respondents and send\n\n                         them to a Government Laboratory for a paternity test.
