On 13.06.2000 at 9.00 p.m., there was a quarrel in the political party and his name was falsely implicated as an accused in respect of Crime No.423 of 2000, which, after trial, subsequently ended in conviction for life imprisonment. Thereafter, the appeal preferred against the said conviction before this Court in Crl.A.No.1753 of 2002 was allowed, thereby acquitting him from the case. In the meanwhile, the 3rd respondent opened a history sheet in the name of the petitioner in the year 2000 in H.S.No.422, Salem after his acquittal. Though he made several representations to the respondents for removal of his name from the history sheet, no steps have been taken so far. Therefore, the petitioner has filed this writ petition seeking for the above direction.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">\t5.\tThe 3rd respondent has filed a counter by stating that the petitioner and his friends joined together and murdered one Ravi, resulting in registration of an FIR in Crime No.423 of 2000 for the offences under <a href=\"/doc/1258372/\" id=\"a_2\">Sections 147</a>, <a href=\"/doc/763672/\" id=\"a_3\">148</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1599401/\" id=\"a_4\">341</a>, <a href=\"/doc/724142/\" id=\"a_5\">324</a>, <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_6\">307</a> IPC and altered to <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 302</a> IPC. Though he was convicted in the Sessions case, pursuant to his appeal, he was acquitted by this Court from the said case. On a careful watch over his activities after his acquittal, it came to light that he subsequently involved in offences such as land grabbing and threatening of public, which necessitated the 3rd respondent to open a History Sheet in H.S.No.422. It is stated in the counter that due to his frequent attempt to disturb the public peace and tranquillity, he comes within the ambit of Police Standing Orders 749(2)(a), which cannot be said to be in violation of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_8\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India. Therefore, it is prayed that the writ petition is liable to be dismissed.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_6\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"971635\" id=\"span_1\">6.\tLearned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that the petitioner is aged about 60 years. Though initially there was a case booked against him under <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 307</a> IPC altered into <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 302</a> IPC, he was subsequently exonerated from the said offence by this Court in appeal. Therefore, at any stretch of imagination, he cannot be termed as a habitual offender and there is also no likelihood of the petitioner in indulging the same in future. Moreover, there is no justification or material whatsoever with the 3rd respondent to open a history sheet against the petitioner so as to keep him under watch. Learned counsel for the petitioner, in support of his submission has relied on a judgment of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/971635/\" id=\"a_11\">Malak Singh and others vs. State of Punjab and Haryana and others</a>, reported in (1981) 1 SCC 420 He has further submitted that the issue in question is covered by the decisions rendered in the aforesaid judgments and therefore, it is prayed that the writ petition be allowed.</span> \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_7\">\t7.\tPer contra, learned Additional Government Pleader has vehemently contended that the petitioner had involved in a murder case, which itself is sufficient for the State to open a History Sheet against him and no other material is required for the said purpose. Therefore, the decision of the authority in this regard cannot be fault with.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_8\">\t8.\tHeard the learned counsel on either side and perused the material documents available on record.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_9\">\t9.\tA factual matrix would reveal that consequent to the petitioner&#x27;s involvement in a murder case, a case in Crime No.423 of 2000 under <a href=\"/doc/1258372/\" id=\"a_12\">Sections 147</a>, <a href=\"/doc/763672/\" id=\"a_13\">148</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1599401/\" id=\"a_14\">341</a>, <a href=\"/doc/724142/\" id=\"a_15\">324</a> and <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_16\">307</a> IPC altered to <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 302</a> IPC came to be registered against him. In the said case, he was sentenced to undergo life imprisonment by an order dated 19.11.2002 passed by the learned Additional District and Sessions Judge, Salem. Aggrieved by the same, the petitioner preferred an appeal in Crl.A.No.1753 of 2002 before this Court, which ultimately ended in acquittal of the petitioner. Thereafter, a History Sheet in H.S.No.422 was opened by the 3rd respondent against him for the purpose of keeping him under discreet surveillance.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_10\">\t10.\tFor the purpose of consideration, it is worthwhile to refer to the Police Standing Orders 746 &amp; 749, which empower the authority concerned to open history sheets, which read as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">\t\u0013746. Part-IV \u0016 History Sheets.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">\t(1) Part V (Form No.111) shall contain the History Sheets of the persons resident permanently or temporarily in their Station limits who are known or believed to be addicted to or to aid and abet the commission of crime, whether convicted or not, or who are believed to be habitual receivers.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_11\">\t749. The following persons shall be classed as suspects and history sheets shall be opened for them under orders of the Superintendent or Divisional Officer, if so empowered by the Superintendent:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">\t(a) Persons once convicted under any section of the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_18\">Indian Penal Code</a> are considered to be likely to commit crime;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">\t(b) Persons, not convicted, but believed to be addicted to crimes.\u0014\t\n\t\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">\t11.\tIn order to form an opinion to arrive at a firm decision in this case, it is necessary for this Court to consider as to whether Police Standing Orders affirm any special discretion on the authorities to open and retain history sheet, or whether the orders contain any inner restrictions. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"476799\" id=\"span_2\">In this regard, the aforesaid question has to be dealt with in the light of the decisions, rendered by the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/476799/\" id=\"a_19\">Sant Raj and another v. O.P.Singla and others</a> reported in (1985)2 SCC 349, wherein it has been held as under:</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">\t\u0013Whenever, it is said that something has to be done, within the discretion of the authority, then that something has to be done, according to the rules of reason and justice and not according to private opinion, according to law and not humour. It is to be not arbitrary, vague and fanciful but legal and regular and it must be exercised within the limit to which an honest man to the discharge of his office ought to find himself. Discretion means sound discretion guided by law. It must be governed by rule, not by humour, it must not be arbitrary, vague and fanciful.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1747748\" id=\"span_3\">12. The Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in a case arising out of the similar issue in <a href=\"/doc/1747748/\" id=\"a_20\">Fasih Chaudhary v. Director General, Doordarshan and others</a>, reported in 1989 1 SCC 89, was pleased to hold thus:</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">\t\u0013Exercise of discretion should be legitimate, fair and without any aversion, malice or affection. Nothing should be done which may give the impression of favouritism or nepotism. While fair play in action in such matters is an essential requirement, &#x27;free play in the joints&#x27; is also a necessary concomitant for an administrative body functioning in an administrative sphere or quasi- administrative sphere as the present one.\u0014\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">\t13.\tOn perusal of the above ratio of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court, one aspect is very clear that the Police Standing Orders do not provide any special license to the Police to enter the names of their choice in the history sheet / rowdy list and according to their own whims and fancies. It is also impermissible for the authorities to intrude into the residence of a citizen and the knocking at his door with the disturbance to his sleep and ordinary comfort, which action is certainly a violation of deprivation of the personal liberty guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_21\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India. Surveillance is also confined to the limited class of citizens, who are determined to lead a criminal life or whose antecedents would reasonably lead to the conclusion that they will lead such a life. Normally, the names of persons with previous criminal record alone are entered in the surveillance register, who must be proclaimed offenders, previous convicts, or persons who have already been placed on security for good behaviour. Apart from the above, as per the provisions of the Police Standing Orders, the names of persons, who are reasonably believed to be habitual offenders or receivers of stolen property, whether they have been convicted or not, may be entered. It is only in the case of this category of persons that there may be occasion for abuse of the power of the police officer to make entries in the surveillance register.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">\t14.\tIt is pertinent to emphasize here that in order to prevent false entries in the surveillance register, Rule 23.5 has been enacted, which empowers the Superintendent of Police alone to make such entry in the register and he is also prohibited from delegating his authority to others. Further it is necessary that the Superintendent of Police must entertain a reasonable belief that persons whose names are to be entered in Part II are habitual offenders of receivers of stolen property. While it may not be necessary to supply the grounds of belief to the persons whose names are entered in the surveillance register, it may become necessary in some cases to satisfy the Court when an entry is challenged that there are grounds to entertain such reasonable belief.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">\t15.\tBearing in mind the above, if the present case is perused, what transpires me is that though the petitioner was convicted in the murder case, subsequently, he was acquitted from the said case by this Court and nowhere in the counter, it is stated that any appeal has been preferred by the State against the said order of acquittal before the higher forum. Police Standing Order 749 (a) clearly stipulates that persons once convicted under any section of the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_22\">Indian Penal Code</a> are considered to be likely to commit crime, whereas at the time of opening the History Sheet, no conviction was pending against the petitioner. Moreover, there is not even an iota of material that there is likelihood of the petitioner indulging in further activities and commission of any crime. Therefore, entering the name of a person in the History Sheet under the Tamil Nadu Police Standing Orders, PSO 746 Part IV in a mechanical, arbitrary, unreasonable or whimsical manner, is against the settled principle of law and also would amount to denial of right to privacy as provided under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_23\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India. \n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"124114412\" id=\"span_4\">16.\tThe Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/124114412/\" id=\"a_24\">Malak Singh and Others vs. State of P&amp;H and Others</a>, reported in (1981) 1 SCC 420),  has been pleased to hold as under:</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">\t\u00139. &quot;But all this does not mean that the police have a licence to enter the names of whoever they like (dislike?) in the surveillance register; nor can the surveillance be such as to squeeze the fundamental freedoms guaranteed to all citizens or to obstruct the free exercise and enjoyment of those freedoms; nor can the surveillance so intrude as to offend the dignity of the individual.  Surveillance of persons who do not fall within the categories mentioned in Rule 23.4 or for reasons unconnected with the prevention of crime, or excessive surveillance falling beyond the limits prescribed by the rules, will entitle a citizen to the Court&#x27;s protection which the Court will not hesitate to give. The very Rules which prescribe the conditions for making entries in the surveillance register and the mode of surveillance appear to recognise the caution and care with which the police officers are required to proceed.  The note following Rule 23.4 is instructive. It enjoins a duty upon the police officer to construe the rule strictly and confine the entries in the surveillance register to the class of persons mentioned in the rule.  Similarly Rule 23.7 demands that there should be no illegal interference in the guise of surveillance.  Surveillance, therefore, has to be unobtrusive and within bounds.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">\t10. &quot;Ordinarily the names of persons with previous criminal record alone are entered in the surveillance register. They must be proclaimed offenders, previous convicts, or persons who have already been placed on security for good behaviour. In addition, names of persons who are reasonably believed to be habitual offenders or receivers of stolen property whether they have been convicted or not may be entered.  It is only in the case of this category of persons that there may be occasion for abuse of the power of the police officer to make entries in the surveillance register.  But, here, the entry can only be made by the order of the Superintendent of Police who is prohibited from delegating his authority under Rule 23.5.  Further it is necessary that the Superintendent of Police must entertain a reasonable belief that persons whose names are to be entered in Part II are habitual offenders of receivers of stolen property. While it may not be necessary to supply the grounds of belief to the persons whose names are entered in the surveillance register it may become necessary in some cases to satisfy the Court when an entry is challenged that there are grounds to entertain such reasonable belief.  In fact in the present case we sent for the relevant records and we have satisfied ourselves that there were sufficient grounds for the Superintendent of Police to entertain a reasonable belief.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"70954506\" id=\"span_5\">17.\tThis Court also in the case of <a href=\"/doc/70954506/\" id=\"a_25\">S.Vani vs. Superintendent of Police, Sivagangai District and others</a>, reported in (2008) 3 MLJ (Crl) 1525, has held as under:</span> \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">\t\t\u001320. Therefore, in the light of the facts narrated and the legal precedents, it must be held that the actions of the respondents in all the three Writ Petitions are condemnable.
