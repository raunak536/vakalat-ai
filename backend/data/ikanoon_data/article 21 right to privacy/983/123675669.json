The case set out by the petitioner is that soon after independence,\n                          the Government of the nation had started indulging in crimes affecting\n                          the entire economy and one such crime had been committed in\n                          connivance with Tata Companies and Trusts i.e. respondent nos. 5 to 7.\n                          It is stated that these respondents commit humongous crimes in top\n                          public organisations in collusion with the Indian Government, which\n                          include crimes such as sedition and suspension of rights of its\n                          employees. It is alleged by the petitioner that the criminal economy\n                          supported by respondent nos. 5 to 7 is worth lakhs of crores of rupees.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_20\">                          8.     In the petition, the petitioner has described his educational and\n                          professional background. It is stated that he is an alumni of IIT, Kanpur\n                          and IIT, Bombay and has also pursued his education in USA, post which\n                          he had joined IIT, Delhi from 2005-07 and thereafter, Tata Institute of\n                          Fundamental Research (TIFR) in 2007, before resigning in 2016. It is\n                          stated that in May, 2023, he had come to know that TIFR had criminally\n                          accepted his protest resignation as it was not investigating possible\n                          cheating by a student during the Ph.D qualifying exam in which he was\n                          the examiner.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_21\">                          9.

To elaborate his claims, petitioner has mentioned about a snare\n                          trap, which is used by Tatas, its Companies and Trusts to establish and\n                          grow its organisations. It is stated that respondent no. 5 and 6 have been\n                          committing extreme crimes against this country in collusion with the\n                          Governments for decades, in public organisations which cater to highest\n                          public aspirations such as academics and research. It is stated that certain\n                          Forms are filled by respondent no. 7 to get various permissions in the\n                          form of licences, contracts, approvals from the Government and the\n                          Government never asks any uncomfortable questions to Tatas about the\n                          crimes that they have been committing in this country for years. It is\n                          stated that this is a layered trap on public aspirations.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_23\">                          11.    The petitioner further states that respondent no. 5 and 6 commit\n                          institutionalised crimes in many public institutions including TIFR, Tata\n                          Memorial Centre (TMC), Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS), etc.,\n                          and these crimes include the government giving seditious guarantees to\n                          respondent no. 5 and 6 that it would not make a change in the structure\n                          of the said institutions without their consent, allowing suspension of\n                          fundamental rights guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_6\">Article 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_7\">19</a>, and allowing\n                          criminal audits in the said institutions.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_24\">                          12.    Petitioner further states that the story of crimes committed by\n                          Tatas starts from signing the criminal TIFR Tripartite Agreement dated\n                          18.02.1956 between the trustees of respondent no. 5, Government of\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">                          W.P.(CRL) 1797/2023 &amp; connected matters                      Page 7 of 50</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">Signed By:ZEENAT</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">PRAVEEN</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">Signing Date:20.07.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">18:15:37</span>\n                           India and the Government of Bombay. It is further claimed in the\n                          petition that Tatas and the Government of India including DoPT have\n                          been stealing the rights of the employees and essentially have been\n                          trafficking the people of this country for decades and, thus, they must be\n                          prosecuted for such crimes.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_25\">                          13.    Moving further, the petitioner has also claimed that during the\n                          India-Pakistan War starting from August, 1965 to the Tashkent\n                          Declaration in 1966, huge crimes were committed in this country by the\n                          people from within the Government which had directly or indirectly\n                          benefited Tatas. Petitioner has also stated that there are some basic\n                          conceptual problems in the structure of this country and there has been a\n                          regular supply of public money into criminal institutions like TIFR,\n                          TMC, TISS, etc.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_26\">                          14.    The petitioner also claims that in a police complaint dated\n                          26.01.2022, he had produced the entire evidence of fraud committed by\n                          Tatas including the contract awarded by Central Public Works\n                          Department to Tata Projects Limited for the Central Vista Project\n                          including the new Parliament building and in this regard, the petitioner\n                          has prayed that whatever has been built by them in the said project, be\n                          demolished from the very foundation so that criminals have nothing to\n                          do with the highest seat of democracy in the country.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_27\">                          15.    Another grievance of the petitioner is that the modus operandi of\n                          the criminals within the government is to make statements that do not\n                          follow the scope or practice of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_8\">Right to Information Act, 2005</a> which\n                          amounts to sedition as they excite disaffection towards this Act, within\n                          the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/1641007/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 124A</a> of IPC.\n</p>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">                          W.P.(CRL) 1797/2023 &amp; connected matters                    Page 8 of 50</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">Signed By:ZEENAT</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">PRAVEEN</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">Signing Date:20.07.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">18:15:37</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_28\">                           16.

It is stated that this humongous crime even\n                          spreads to many private organisations.

It is stated that contradictions arose when a Society under the\n                          <a href=\"/doc/1700055/\" id=\"a_16\">Societies Registration Act, 1860</a> or an equivalent Act was brought under\n                          an arrangement where it was supposed to follow Government orders. It\n                          is stated that this creates legal problems because the Society operates as\n                          per its objects, which could be aligned with that of the Government as\n                          per the arrangement, but the Society could (re-)interpret its existing\n                          objects, make changes in such objects, and also affect other big changes\n                          including amalgamation of Societies using its internal democracy as per\n                          <a href=\"/doc/1301809/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 12</a> of the Act. Hence, on one hand, the arrangement dictates that\n                          it must follow the Government orders and on the other hand, its structure\n                          gives the freedom to make changes affecting its decisions, which include\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_67\">                          W.P.(CRL) 1797/2023 &amp; connected matters                        Page 13 of 50</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_68\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_69\">Signed By:ZEENAT</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_70\">PRAVEEN</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_71\">Signing Date:20.07.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_72\">18:15:37</span>\n                           going against the Government orders because such orders could be\n                          deemed to be against its (new) objects. Hence, the situation provides for\n                          the Society bound to follow and to legally disobey the Government at\n                          the same time, which excites disaffection towards the Government\n                          within the meaning of Section 124A as well as 405 of <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_18\">IPC</a>.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_32\">                          20.    The petitioner states that a mere reading of the law applicable to\n                          the situation implies that the Institutions of National Importance of this\n                          country were stolen from this country directly or indirectly by the\n                          lawmakers of this country. He further states that he had approached the\n                          organisations mentioned among the respondent nos. 22-47 by filing RTI\n                          applications and appeals to know their legal status including whether\n                          they were Societies, but they did not respond properly to such a query,\n                          which invites invocation of <a href=\"/doc/131084311/\" id=\"a_19\">Sections 166A(b)</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1815602/\" id=\"a_20\">167</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1249173/\" id=\"a_21\">405</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1326844/\" id=\"a_22\">409</a> of IPC.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_33\">                          21.

It is stated that some of these criminal organisations\n                          affect even children such as the Central Board of Secondary Education\n                          (CBSE), National Council of Educational Research and Training\n                          (NCERT), Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan, Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti,\n                          and National Institute of Open Schooling.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_34\">                          22.

While also claiming that the &#x27;criminal economy&#x27; supported by\n                          respondent no. 7 is worth more than hundreds of lakhs of crores of\n                          rupees, for which petitioner has given some self-created charts and\n                          diagrams, the petitioner has not brought on record any evidence to\n                          disclose commission of any cognizable offence committed by any of the\n                          respondents arraigned in the present petition.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_67\">                          50.    In this background, it is also important to note that on the basis of\n                          such baseless allegations, the petitioner has sought initiation of\n                          criminal prosecution, including giving punishments such as death\n                          penalty through firing squads and/or rigorous imprisonment to\n                          respondent no. 5-7, all the governing bodies of respondent no. 8 as well\n                          as officials of the government in the Ministry of Defence. Another\n                          astonishing relief sought by the petitioner relates to stay on the\n                          construction of new Parliament building and directing destruction of\n                          the same, merely because the contract for development/construction of\n                          the same was awarded to one of the companies of respondent no. 7.\n</p>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_149\">                          W.P.(CRL) 1797/2023 &amp; connected matters                      Page 26 of 50</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_150\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_151\">Signed By:ZEENAT</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_152\">PRAVEEN</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_153\">Signing Date:20.07.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_154\">18:15:37</span>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_68\">                           51.     Another relief sought in the present petition is with regard to\n                          taking appropriate action against respondent no. 3-5 and other police\n                          organisations for not acting on the various complaints filed by petitioner\n                          as well as against police in Punjab and Tamil Nadu. Needless to say,\n                          such a prayer is devoid of any merit as this Court cannot exercise its\n                          jurisdiction over police organisations of the State of Punjab or of Tamil\n                          Nadu.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_69\">                          52.     Moreover, the petitioner has merely averred, once or twice in the\n                          petition, that the rights of employees, working in the companies or\n                          organisation of respondent no. 7-8, are regularly violated. However,\n                          nothing has been placed on record to even substantiate such claims or to\n                          show to this Court as to how the petitioner is aggrieved by the same. The\n                          petitioner has not shown to this Court as to what fundamental right or\n                          legal right of his is being violated by the respondents so as to persuade\n                          this Court to give its indulgence to the present petition.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_70\">                          (II)    W.P.(CRL) 1798/2023\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_71\">                          53.     This petition essentially seeks to enforce the rights of citizens to\n                          have public organisations which are not criminally established. It was\n                          stated that hundreds of organisations and institutes of national\n                          importance such as IITs, IIMs, AIIMS, etc. are all criminally\n                          established organisations since they are societies under the Societies\n                          Registration Act, 1860, and there is a legal option for these organisations\n                          to disobey the Government and even join forces against it.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_72\">                          54.     An examination of this petition also reveals that the petitioner has\n                          narrated facts, pertaining to the year 1951 onwards, and then has gone\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_155\">                          W.P.(CRL) 1797/2023 &amp; connected matters                      Page 27 of 50</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_156\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_157\">Signed By:ZEENAT</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_158\">PRAVEEN</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_159\">Signing Date:20.07.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_160\">18:15:37</span>\n                           ahead to level allegations against the then Government of India\n                          which had allegedly criminally established Viswa Bharati, after\n                          which the aforesaid problem had started to arise. In this regard, the\n                          petitioner prays that this Court directs respondent no. 2 to register an\n                          FIR on the basis of complaint filed by him with police on 18.03.2021.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_73\">                          55.    To appreciate this argument, this Court has gone through the\n                          contents of the said complaint which the petitioner had lodged with the\n                          SHO, Police Station Sansad Marg. In this complaint, the petitioner has\n                          requested the police to initiate action against the Government of India,\n                          all the societies registered under <a href=\"/doc/1700055/\" id=\"a_41\">Societies Registration Act</a>, and\n                          Registrar of Societies where such societies are registered either in States\n                          or in Union Territories. In the complaint, the petitioner has merely stated\n                          about establishment of several institutions of national importance\n                          through different laws passed by the Indian Parliament, which in the\n                          opinion of petitioner, had been established criminally and since such a\n                          crime as per petitioner is so widespread, the petitioner deems it fit to call\n                          the same as a &#x27;pandemic&#x27;. Rest of the contents of the complaint are\n                          totally confusing and this Court has failed to gather any intelligible\n                          information from it.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_74\">                          56.    The petitioner by way of this petition also seeks registration of\n                          FIR on the basis of complaint filed by him on 17.12.2021 against\n                          respondent no. 11 i.e. some judges of the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court who\n                          had delivered the judgment in case bearing number Civil Appeal No.\n                          6394/2010. A perusal of the said complaint reveals that the grievance of\n                          the petitioner is that the Hon‟ble Apex Court had upheld the autonomy\n                          of a society registered under <a href=\"/doc/1700055/\" id=\"a_42\">Societies Registration Act</a> by selectively\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_161\">                          W.P.(CRL) 1797/2023 &amp; connected matters                       Page 28 of 50</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_162\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_163\">Signed By:ZEENAT</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_164\">PRAVEEN</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_165\">Signing Date:20.07.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_166\">18:15:37</span>\n                           quoting the provisions of the Act to arrive at a conclusion that a part of\n                          Tata Memorial Centre under the authority of Government should be\n                          transferred to the authority of TMC Society. As per petitioner, this is an\n                          example of disaffection towards the Government of the nation and\n                          attracts <a href=\"/doc/1641007/\" id=\"a_43\">Sections 124A</a>, <a href=\"/doc/570574/\" id=\"a_44\">166</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1815602/\" id=\"a_45\">167</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1441158/\" id=\"a_46\">217</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1280620/\" id=\"a_47\">378</a>, and <a href=\"/doc/1101188/\" id=\"a_48\">379</a> of IPC as well\n                          <a href=\"/doc/178303/\" id=\"a_49\">Section 13(d)</a> of Prevention of Corruption Act. Having gone through the\n                          contents of this complaint, suffice it to say, such allegations are not only\n                          scandalous but contemptuous in nature.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_75\">                          57.    This Court notes that the petitioner has claimed a right which he\n                          terms as „right to have public organisations that are not criminally\n                          established‟ within the ambit of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_50\">Article 21</a> of Indian Constitution. In\n                          this regard, the petitioner was expressly requested to substantiate how\n                          his individual fundamental right had been infringed. Despite the\n                          petitioner presenting extensive arguments, he failed to convince this\n                          Court of the adequacy of facts or reasons to establish even the slightest\n                          violation of his rights.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_76\">                          58.    It is noted that petitioner‟s affidavit filed along with the petition\n                          clarifies that &quot;the facts and circumstances stated therein are true and\n                          correct to the best of my own knowledge and belief&quot;. Though the\n                          petitioner was informing by way of filing the affidavit that his\n                          reasonable belief and pleadings are based on true facts and existing law,\n                          this Court is constrained to pay attention to the fact that he was born in\n                          the year 1972 and he states that his fundamental right was infringed\n                          by those events which happened one century earlier.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_77\">                          59.

In the said application, the\n                          petitioner had claimed that he had been filing police complaints with\n                          Delhi Police on matters of extreme public interest and complaints which\n                          are against Government of India and crimes committed by the\n                          corporates, and since he has been doing so, he apprehends that false\n                          cases may have been lodged against him. He also stated that even Delhi\n                          Police may have something against him personally since they have not\n                          acted on his complaints, although he states he has no reasons as such to\n                          make this assumption, but nevertheless, he was curious. In reply to the\n                          said RTI application, the concerned public information officer of Central\n                          District, Delhi Police had informed the petitioner that as per reports, no\n                          such complaint or FIR has been registered against the RTI applicant i.e.\n                          petitioner herein.

Upon perusal of records, as also observed in preceding paragraph,\n                          it is evident that the petitioner had filed an application under <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_58\">RTI Act</a>\n                          requesting for his criminal records, and the authorities had duly\n                          responded to the application as well as all other appeals, etc. In this\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_179\">                          W.P.(CRL) 1797/2023 &amp; connected matters                      Page 31 of 50</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_180\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_181\">Signed By:ZEENAT</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_182\">PRAVEEN</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_183\">Signing Date:20.07.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_184\">18:15:37</span>\n                           regard, this Court does not find any merit in the argument of the\n                          petitioner that the replies given to him by the authorities were\n                          insufficient or in improper format. Upon careful examination of the\n                          replies given by the concerned authorities to the petitioner, it is evident\n                          that the concerned authorities through their replies have adequately\n                          addressed the issues raised by the petitioner in a fair and appropriate\n                          manner.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_84\">                          65.    It is also strange that the petitioner is aggrieved that there was no\n                          criminal record of him, available with police.

Rather the authorities\n                          have shown patience and replied over 150 times as admitted by\n                          petitioner himself.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_85\">                          66.

They have a duty to critically assess the merits\n                          of their claims and consider whether there is a reasonable legal basis for\n                          their case. Since frivolous litigation burdens the Court system, wastes\n                          judicial resources, and hinders the administration of justice, it is the\n                          responsibility of the self-represented litigants to ensure that their case\n                          has a genuine legal basis, supported by relevant facts and legal\n                          principles.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_116\">                          90.

A substantial amount of judicial time is consumed to hear such\n                          litigant, as the litigant has a right to come to the Court and file a case\n                          seeking remedy for his grievance, even if the petition needs to be heard\n                          on its maintainability or merit, the judge is occupied with a substantial\n                          amount of judicial time disposing of the case after going through the file\n                          which may run into thousands of pages.

The Hon‟ble Apex Court has not only emphasised the significance\n                          of imposing costs but has also shed light on the underlying intention\n                          behind this provision. One of the primary rationales for incorporating the\n                          provision of cost is to serve as a deterrent against vexatious, frivolous,\n                          and speculative litigations or defences. The rationale behind imposing\n                          costs is rooted in the need to discourage parties from engaging in\n                          unnecessary or baseless legal actions. Frivolous litigations and defences\n                          place a burden on the judicial system, waste valuable court resources,\n                          and delay the resolution of genuine disputes. By deterring such conduct\n                          through the imposition of costs, the court aims to maintain the integrity\n                          and efficiency of the legal process. The potential liability for costs acts\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_255\">                          W.P.(CRL) 1797/2023 &amp; connected matters                               Page 43 of 50</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_256\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_257\">Signed By:ZEENAT</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_258\">PRAVEEN</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_259\">Signing Date:20.07.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_260\">18:15:37</span>\n                           as an incentive for parties to carefully evaluate the merits of their case,\n                          undertake reasonable research, and approach the court in good faith.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_127\">                          99.    Furthermore, the provision of cost acts as a safeguard to protect\n                          the interests of genuine litigants. It ensures that those who genuinely\n                          require access to justice are not impeded or burdened by the unwarranted\n                          actions of others. By discouraging the filing of frivolous litigations or\n                          defences, the court allocates its limited resources to matters that are\n                          genuine and bona fide.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_128\">                          100. Even in a case of self-representation, it cannot be only the ground\n                          for protection. There can be no fixed rule to test frivolous litigation, the\n                          docket space cannot be allowed to be encroached upon by such litigation\n                          and financial sanction, and cost can serve as a retributive function\n                          leading to effective deterrents. Furthermore, encouraging judicial\n                          discretion in determining costs for frivolous litigations can act as a\n                          deterrent against abuse. This discretion should be exercised judiciously,\n                          taking into account the facts, circumstances, and intentions of the parties\n                          involved.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_129\">                          101. In cases such as the present one where notices are yet to be issued\n                          and the case was not found even fit to issue notice being frivolous, the\n                          respondents have appeared on advance notice. The sheer magnanimity of\n                          the absurdness and irrational pleading have been found to be an abuse of\n                          process of law by this Court. Our country itself has been degraded; the\n                          judicial education institutes that have found their place in the first\n                          hundred in the world have been maligned.

While the Courts have consistently demonstrated patience in\n                          dealing with such meritless litigations, instances of costs being imposed\n                          in proportion to the volume of frivolous cases filed in our country have\n                          been limited. The reluctance of the Courts to impose costs on frivolous\n                          litigants, particularly those representing themselves, remains evident,\n                          despite the few and infrequent instances where costs have been imposed.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_131\">                          103. One cannot prescribe any mechanism efficient enough to\n                          eliminate nuisance claims, as the citizens in India have a fundamental\n                          right to free access to justice. This however, does not deter the Courts to\n                          strike the pleadings at the threshold and impose penalty on patently\n                          meritless claims.

The petitioner could not set out any facts or material on which he\n                                  raises his claim to seek relief and, thus, the petition did not\n                                  disclose either a reasonable cause or ground to invoke writ\n                                  jurisdiction of this Court.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_51\">                             3.   This Court found the petitions to be frivolous and vexatious as it\n                                  challenged, demeaned, criticised and used language which is\n                                  undeniably embarrassing and scandalous.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_52\">                             4.   It was also devoid of any real issue being set out in intelligible\n                                  form.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_53\">                             5.   The pleadings, reliefs and declarations sought from this Court\n                                  were impossible to respond to for the sheer magnanimity of their\n                                  absurdness.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_138\">                          109. Due to the above reasons, this Court finds that filing of these writ\n                          petitions is certainly an abuse of process of law.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_139\">                          110. While the Courts are trying to do their best by reforming and\n                          modernising access to justice, it is time to also explore ways of dealing\n                          with frivolous litigation-related issues and find appropriate responses\n                          through new policies while the law reforms are taking place in our\n                          country. Frivolous litigation should also be one of the focal points in the\n                          journey of judicial reforms as it will go a long way in achieving the\n                          major goal of ensuring a speedy and effective justice system.\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_279\">                          W.P.(CRL) 1797/2023 &amp; connected matters                     Page 47 of 50</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_280\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_281\">Signed By:ZEENAT</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_282\">PRAVEEN</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_283\">Signing Date:20.07.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_284\">18:15:37</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_140\">                           111. The general public may just get glimpses of the data of a large\n                          number of pendency of cases before the Courts and, at times, may\n                          express their anguish about such pendency. But the phenomenon of\n                          litigation explosion, which includes the large number of frivolous and\n                          vexatious litigation, may not come to the notice in the public domain.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_141\">                          112. What one needs to focus on is also the fact that it cannot only be\n                          the responding party in the litigation but it is the public at large also who\n                          is affected by such abuse of the system. While a judge will be in a\n                          dilemma as the frivolous litigant will have to be heard as the Court has\n                          inherent jurisdiction and duty to hear a person who files a writ petition\n                          arguing that he is aggrieved, and though the self-represented vexatious\n                          litigant are a minute minority, their cases cannot be summarily rejected\n                          as they have a right to be heard. In any case, judicial orders in such cases\n                          are required to prevent future abusive proceedings. While imposing costs\n                          may be one way to tackle such litigation, there may be cases where the\n                          unpaid cost orders become another ground for seeking further\n                          indulgence from the Court.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_142\">                          113. While there can be no assumption that petitioner‟s claim in the\n                          writ petition is malicious prosecution, it is only after hearing the parties\n                          and going through its contents, which involves spending judicial time\n                          which is more often than not beyond court hours since judges spend time\n                          reading the files before they start the hearings the next date, can be better\n                          invested for a better cause.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_143\">                          114. The petitioner in the present case is an alumni of IIT, Delhi and\n                          Bombay and has rather remained associated with IIT, Delhi, for long.

Moreover, he\n                          demonstrated a sound understanding of the purpose and legal basis upon\n                          which he approached the court, assuming full responsibility for the\n                          contents of the petition and possessing relevant and substantiated\n                          materials within his possession and control. He was given a choice of\n                          being assisted by a counsel, but he refused to be assisted.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_144\">                          115. In this Court‟s opinion, reasonable sanctions and imposing the\n                          cost would go a long way in deterring such litigants before pursuing\n                          frivolous litigation.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_145\">                          116. It is made clear that this Court, by way of the present judgment,\n                          should not be taken to be laying down the law putting any restriction on\n                          the right of a citizen to access the Court or to curb noble and creative\n                          advocacy which may stunt the growth of jurisprudence or contributing\n                          meaningfully to the growth of law and ensuring implementation of\n                          fundamental rights in case of such violation but deter and de-clog the\n                          legal system of such frivolous litigation by fear of financial sanction and\n                          deter them from filing unfounded litigation.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_146\">                          117. While judicial restraint is a virtue, it has its limits and this\n                          Court can observe that these petitions have tested the said virtue. Still\n                          the present case tries to initiate a meaningful debate to balance the\n                          competing rules of protecting the right of a person to freely access and\n                          pursue legal remedies in the Court and also redress the abusive process\n                          of frivolous litigation.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_147\">                          118. Given the volume of frivolous litigation staring hard at the\n                          overburdened judiciary, it is the right time for taking action against such\n                          litigants.
