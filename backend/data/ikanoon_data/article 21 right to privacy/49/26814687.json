The\n\npetitioner denied those allegations. According to him, a false case\n\nhas been foisted against him.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">       4.   The   petitioner   was   arrested   on   12/10/2021   and\n\nremanded to judicial custody. He moved an application for regular\n\nbail at the Sessions Court, Ernakulam. The learned Additional\n\nSessions Judge II dismissed the bail application on 29/10/2021 as\n\nper Ext. P3 order. Thereafter, an application for bail was moved\n\nbefore this court, which was allowed on 19/11/2021 as per Ext. P1\n\norder. The petitioner    was released from custody on the same\n\nday.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">       5.   During the investigation, respondent No.3 (The New\n\nIndian Express) published an online write-up about the case of\n\nthe petitioner titled &quot;Man in Jail for &#x27;rape&#x27; after Friends&#x27; Reunion&quot;.\n\nIts printout is marked as Ext. P2. The write-up, which identifies\n\nthe petitioner by his name, provides the details of the alleged act,\n\nincluding the version of the police, victim, and defence, and the\n\nfact that the Sessions Court dismissed the bail application with its\n\nreasons.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\"> WP(Crl) No.318/2022</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_6\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                              -:5:-</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">     6.

P4.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">     7.    It is alleged that Ext. P2 is a prejudicial publication\n\ncontaining sensitising, distorted and misleading facts which\n\nimplicitly pronounce that the petitioner is guilty of rape, with a\n\nview to grab the attention of the people and Ext. P4 publication\n\nwhich exhibits his name, father&#x27;s name and address is highly\n\nprejudicial to him especially since the case is in its preliminary\n\ninvestigation stage. It is further alleged that those publications\n\nviolate the principles of presumption of innocence inasmuch as\n\nthey tantamount to the pre-trial pronouncement of guilt of the\n\npetitioner that makes him and his family identifiable and thereby\n\nvulnerable. It is also alleged that apart from hampering the right\n\nto fair trial, Exts.P2 and P4 have also impacted his dignity,\n\nreputation, and privacy. According to the petitioner, as a direct\n\nresult of the publishing of Exts. P2 and P4 online, he was\n\nterminated from his employment and is now jobless, and his wife,\n\ntwo minor daughters and aged parents are severely affected in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\"> WP(Crl) No.318/2022</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                    -:6:-</span>\n\nvarious manners due to the publications.

For a country like ours, which is a parliamentary\n\ndemocracy, freedom of speech and expression is an essential\n\nright. The freedom of speech and expression, as envisaged under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_60\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution, means the right to free\n\nspeech and to express opinions through various media. The right\n\nincludes the freedom of the press. The freedom of the press is the\n\nfundamental tenet of the constitutional democracy in India. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"456839\" id=\"span_29\">In\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\"> WP(Crl) No.318/2022</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">                              -:15:-</span>\n\n<a href=\"/doc/456839/\" id=\"a_61\">Romesh Thappar v. State of Madras</a> (AIR 1950 SC 124), while\n\nhighlighting that freedom of speech is the foundation of all\n\ndemocratic organisations, the Apex Court held that said freedom\n\nwould also include freedom of the press. Freedom of the press\n\ntakes within its fold a number of rights; one such right is the\n\nfreedom of publication. However, the expansive and sweeping\n\nambit of such freedom notwithstanding, the right to freedom of\n\nspeech and expression, like all other rights in the Constitution, is\n\nalso not absolute; it is subject to the imposition of reasonable\n\nrestrictions.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\">      17.   Reporting   of   the   court   proceedings    increases\n\ntransparency and faith of the public in the judiciary. The role of\n\nthe media is that of a watchdog to disseminate truth to the\n\nknowledge of the public. A free and healthy press is indispensable\n\nto the functioning of a true democracy. Public has a right to know\n\nwhat is happening in courts. The right to know is a basic right\n\nwhich the citizen of a free country aspires. The concept of open\n\njustice permits fair and accurate reports of court proceedings to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\"> WP(Crl) No.318/2022</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">                              -:16:-</span>\n\nbe published. As adjudication is not a private activity, the open\n\ncourt is the norm for legal proceedings. Indian law recognises\n\nopen court justice. The language of<a href=\"/doc/1134316/\" id=\"a_62\"> S.327</a> of Cr.P.C indicates that\n\nthe place where the Criminal Court is held for inquiry and trial of\n\nany offence shall be deemed an open court. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"195974816\" id=\"span_34\">Sub-section (2) of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/520270/\" id=\"a_63\">S.327</a> only creates an exception to the general rule and states\n\nthat cases relating to sexual offences, i.e. <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_64\">Sections 376</a>, <a href=\"/doc/668689/\" id=\"a_65\">376A</a>,\n\n<a href=\"/doc/396/\" id=\"a_66\">376B</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1553346/\" id=\"a_67\">376C</a>, <a href=\"/doc/9545/\" id=\"a_68\">376D</a> or 376E of <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_69\">IPC</a> shall be conducted in camera.\n\nIt is one of the salutary principles of the administration of justice\n\nthat justice must not only be done but must also be seen to be\n\ndone, and an &#x27;open trial&#x27; reaffirms the said principle. If those who\n\nare present in the open court can hear it, the entire world is\n\nentitled to hear it through media. Recently, a Division Bench of\n\nthis Court in <a href=\"/doc/195974816/\" id=\"a_70\">Vysakh v.

We may now summarise the broad principles flowing from\n     the above discussion:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">     (1) The right to privacy is implicit in the right to life and liberty\n     guaranteed to the citizens of this country by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_88\">Article 21.</a> It is a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\"> WP(Crl) No.318/2022</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">                                     -:20:-</span>\n\n     &quot;right to be let alone&quot;. A citizen has a right to safeguard the\n     privacy   of   his   own,   his    family,   marriage,   procreation,\n     motherhood,     child-bearing      and   education   among     other\n     matters. None can publish anything concerning the above\n     matters without his consent -- whether truthful or otherwise\n     and whether laudatory or critical. If he does so, he would be\n     violating the right to privacy of the person concerned and\n     would be liable in an action for damages. Position may,\n     however, be different, if a person voluntarily thrusts himself\n     into controversy or voluntarily invites or raises a controversy.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">     (2) The rule aforesaid is subject to the exception, that any\n     publication    concerning    the     aforesaid   aspects    becomes\n     unobjectionable if such publication is based upon public\n     records including court records. This is for the reason that once\n     a matter becomes a matter of public record, the right to\n     privacy no longer subsists and it becomes a legitimate subject\n     for comment by press and media among others. We are,\n     however, of the opinion that in the interests of decency [<a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_89\">Article\n     19(2)]</a> an exception must be carved out to this rule, viz., a\n     female who is the victim of a sexual assault, kidnap, abduction\n     or a like offence should not further be subjected to the\n     indignity of her name and the incident being publicised in\n     press/media.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_29\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"13950000\" id=\"span_48\">23.

The Law Commission of India, in its 84 th report on\n\n&#x27;Rape and Allied Offences&#x27; in the year 1980, expressed the\n\nopinion that there is a need for legislation to preserve the\n\nanonymity of the victim and accused in the case of rape and\n\nallied offences. After that, the Parliament introduced sub-sections\n\n(2) and (3) to <a href=\"/doc/520270/\" id=\"a_110\">Section 327</a> of Cr.

Hence, the law as\n\nit stands now clearly provides that it shall not be lawful for a\n\nperson to print and publish any matter in relation to the inquiry or\n\ntrial of rape or an offence under <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_124\">Sections 376</a>, <a href=\"/doc/668689/\" id=\"a_125\">376A</a>, <a href=\"/doc/396/\" id=\"a_126\">376B</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1553346/\" id=\"a_127\">376C</a>,\n\n<a href=\"/doc/9545/\" id=\"a_128\">376D</a> or 376E of <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_129\">IPC</a> except with the previous permission of the\n\nCourt, that too subject to maintaining confidentiality of name and\n\naddress of the parties, both the victim and the accused.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_35\">     29.     The next question is whether the said prohibition\n\nextends to the proceedings where the bail application is heard\n\nand decided by the Magistrate or the Court.

The definition of &quot;inquiry&quot; in <a href=\"/doc/915147/\" id=\"a_137\">Section 2(g)</a> in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_138\">Cr.P.C</a> is not exhaustive. The term &quot;inquiry&quot; under <a href=\"/doc/132965/\" id=\"a_139\">Section 2(g)</a> of\n\nCr.P.C has a very wide connotation and includes every step taken\n\nby the Magistrate other than the trial conducted under <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_140\">Cr.P.C</a>. The\n\nproceedings by which the Magistrate or Court considers a bail\n\napplication is judicial one and the Magistrate or Court acts in a\n\njudicial capacity. It is part of inquiry. Thus, the embargo under\n\nsub-section (3) of <a href=\"/doc/1134316/\" id=\"a_141\">Section 327</a> of Cr.P.C against publication of any\n\nmatter concerning the court proceedings also applies to bail\n\nproceedings. The protection accorded to the parties under sub-\n\nsection (3) of <a href=\"/doc/1134316/\" id=\"a_142\">Section 327</a> of Cr.P.C during trial or inquiry cannot\n\nbe denied at the stage of consideration of bail application by the\n\nMagistrate or the Court. Respondent No.3 has no case that they\n\nhave obtained any permission from the Court which passed\n\nExt.P3 before publishing Ext.P2. Ext.P2 discloses the name of the\n\npetitioner. Thus, it violates sub-section (3) of <a href=\"/doc/1134316/\" id=\"a_143\">Section 327</a> of\n\nCr.P.C. As per the oral direction of this court, respondent No.3 has\n\nalready removed the news content in Ext.P2 from their website.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_72\"> WP(Crl) No.318/2022</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_73\">                              -:29:-</span>\n\nHence, no further order is necessary.

Ext.P4 published by respondent No.4 is nothing but an\n\nonline copy of Ext.P1 bail order indexed on online search engines.\n\nIn today&#x27;s hyper-connected world, court judgments and orders in\n\nelectronic forms are almost perpetually available. In open court\n\nproceedings, nobody, much less the petitioner, can have a\n\ngrievance in uploading and publishing the judgments online. The\n\ngrievance of the petitioner is against allowing his personal\n\ninformation to remain permanently in the digital public place,\n\ninvading his right to privacy. The learned counsel for the\n\npetitioner submits that the digital immortality or perpetuity of the\n\npetitioner&#x27;s sensitive personal information available online with\n\nExt.P4 violates his right to privacy, reputation, dignity, and the\n\nprinciples of presumption of innocence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_37\">     31.

The\n\nBench was dealing with a batch of petitions seeking the removal\n\nof identifiable information from judgments or orders published in\n\nvarious online portals and the High Court website, alleging that it\n\nis a violation of the right to privacy and right to be forgotten. It\n\nwas contended that the publishers of judgments like Indian Kanoon\n\nand other law journals have no right to publish the details of the\n\nparties and allow them to be indexed, ignoring the privacy rights\n\nof the parties. After adverting to several issues, such as the right\n\nto privacy, the right to anonymity and the right to forget the past\n\nof parties in lis, the right of the public to know the details of the\n\ncourt proceedings, the right of the publishers and law journals to\n\nreport and publish judgments, the need to maintain transparency\n\nin judicial records and the absence of a judicial policy regulating\n\nuploading judgments containing name and details of the parties,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_80\"> WP(Crl) No.318/2022</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_81\">                              -:32:-</span>\n\nthe Division Bench held that the claim for the protection of\n\npersonal information based on the right to privacy could not\n\ncoexist in an open court justice system, and a mere extension of\n\nan open court system in digital space cannot itself be called\n\nviolative of privacy rights, in the absence of any law <a href=\"/doc/195974816/\" id=\"a_147\">laid down in</a>\n\nthis regard by the Parliament. It was further held that the court\n\ncannot prevent the dissemination of case details in the public\n\ndomain, citing the privacy of individual litigants and the Individual\n\nprivacy rights must yield to the larger public interest of the court,\n\nmaking judicial function open to all to ensure public confidence.

Ultimately, it was concluded that the right\n\nto be forgotten (a facet of the right to privacy) cannot be claimed\n\nin pending or concluded court proceedings. The Bench, however,\n\npermitted the masking of personal identities in matrimonial cases\n\nand in cases where the law does not recognize the open court\n\nsystem on the High Court website.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_82\"> WP(Crl) No.318/2022</span><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_41\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_83\">                              -:33:-</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_42\">     33.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"195974816\" id=\"span_84\">In view of the dictum <a href=\"/doc/195974816/\" id=\"a_149\">laid down in</a> <a href=\"/doc/195974816/\" id=\"a_150\">Vysakh</a> (supra), the\n\npetitioner is not entitled to the relief sought to remove Ext.P4\n\nfrom the website of respondent No.4 based on the right to\n\nprivacy.
