On 4 th April, 2020 he had written to the Officer-in-\n     Charge of New Capital Complex Police Station, making certain\n     allegations against the Chief Minister. It appears that he had typed the\n     said letter on a paper carrying State emblem. On 5th April, 2020 one\n     Advocate Arabinda Deb wrote to the Officer-in-Charge of New Capital\n     Complex Police Station, Agartala, alleging that the petitioner by use of\n     the said emblem unauthorizedly committed offence of forgery with a\n     view to harm and injure the reputation of the Chief Minister. He\n     requested that necessary legal action against the petitioner be initiated.\n     On 5th April 2020 itself, the police authorities approached the Judicial\n     Magistrate, First Class, Agartala, for issuance of a search warrant\n     against the petitioner. On 5 th April, 2020 the Judicial Magistrate passed\n     an order recording that without further hearing search warrant cannot\n     be issued and, therefore, he reserved the prayer and ordered further\n     hearing on 6 th April, 2020. On 6 th April, 2020 the Judicial Magistrate\n     passed a detailed speaking order rejecting the request for search\n     warrant.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">                       The case of the petitioner is that the police authorities\n     on 5 th April 2020, despite the Judicial Magistrate refusing to grant the\n     prayer for search warrant, raided the residential premise of the\n     petitioner. The petitioner has made detailed allegations about the\n     manner and method of which the said search was carried out. According\n     to him, on the said date nearly 200 armed police personnel under the\n     command of Deputy Superintendent of Police, West Tripura, stormed\n     the residence of the petitioner at about 2.45 p.m. The petitioner was\n     residing alone at that time. The senior leaders of the political parties\n     upon learning of the ongoing search arrived at the site and tried to\n     intervene. However, the petitioner was locked up in the house and the\n     visitors were not allowed to enter the house. The petitioner was\n     physically and mentally harassed. The petitioner&#x27;s detention continued\n     for nearly 3 Â½ hours. This exposed the petitioner who is a 70 year old\n     person to grave risk of contacting Coronavirus since the raid was carried\n     out at a time when Coronavirus was spreading.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">                In brief, the case of the petitioner is that the entire action\n     was a result of political vendetta.

Then, subsequently vide Order dated 06.01.2021, passed\n\nby the Hon&#x27;ble Single Bench of this Court, the said WP(C) No.645\n\nof 2020 was converted into Writ Petition(Criminal) under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_4\">Section\n\n482</a> of Cr.P.C.

After hearing both sides on the said I.A., since the\n\nprayer was not opposed by the respondents, this Court by order\n\ndated 12.09.2023 allowed the said I.A. No.01 of 2023 and the Crl.\n\nPetn.

The case of the petitioner in a nutshell is that Sri\n\nBiplab   Kumar     Deb,    the   then    Chief    Minister   of   Tripura      on\n\n02.04.2020 visited the AGMC &amp; GBP Hospital and made a\n\nstatement to the press media persons on camera stating that high\n\nalertness is called for as in Karimganj, Assam and also in Manipur\n\n16/17 corona positive cases have been detected.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_19\">11.            Finding fault with the said statement, the petitioner\n\nlodged a written complaint on 04.04.2020 to the Superintendent of\n\nPolice, West Tripura District, alleging that fake information was\n\ngiven by the then Chief Minister of Tripura, Sri Biplab Kumar Deb.\n\nThe said written complaint was lodged under <a href=\"/doc/534484/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 182</a>,\n\n<a href=\"/doc/360749/\" id=\"a_12\">505(1)(b)</a> of the Indian Penal Code, before the NCC Police Station,\n\nAgartala. Thereafter, as a counterblast to the written complaint\n\nlodged by the petitioner, against the then Chief Minister of Tripura\n\non 04.04.2020, Sri Arabinda Deb, an Advocate, who is also an\n\nAssistant Public Prosecutor of learned Sessions Judge, West Tripura\n\nDistrict, lodged a counter compliant on 05.04.2020 to the O.C.\n\nNCC Police Station, alleging that the petitioner has unauthorizedly\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                               Page 7 of 27</span>\n\n\n\n\nused Ashok Chakra, National Emblem while making malicious and\n\nfalse complaint against the then Chief Minister of Tripura.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_20\">12.          On 05.04.2020, a group of armed police personnel\n\nunder the command of the DSP West Tripura, respondent No.4\n\nherein, and 11 other police officers including the O.C. East\n\nAgartala, Police Station, O.C. West Agartala Police Station, the\n\nO.C. NCC police station stormed into the residence of the\n\npetitioner. On 05.04.2020, the I.O. of NCC P.S. case No.52/2020\n\nmade a prayer to the concerned Court for issuance of search\n\nwarrant for the search of the house of the petitioner, but the\n\nlearned Judicial Magistrate, First Class Tripura (in-charge being a\n\nSunday) held that a detailed hearing is needed and posted the\n\nmatter on 06.04.2020, before the regular Court. Thereafter a\n\ndetailed hearing was done before the learned Addl. Chief Judicial\n\nMagistrate, West Tripura and, the learned Court rejected the\n\nprayer for search by order dated 06.04.2020. But in the meantime\n\nsearch has been done on 05.04.2020 itself.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_21\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_22\">13.          Now the petitioner by filing this petition agitated that\n\nthe police authorities on 5th April 2020, despite the Judicial\n\nMagistrate refusing to grant the prayer for the search warrant,\n\nraided the residential premise of the petitioner. According to him,\n\non the said date nearly 200 armed police personnel under the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                               Page 8 of 27</span>\n\n\n\n\ncommand of Deputy Superintendent of Police, West Tripura,\n\nstormed the residence of the petitioner at about 2.45 p.m. The\n\npetitioner was residing alone at that time. The senior leaders of the\n\npolitical parties upon learning of the ongoing search arrived at the\n\nsite and tried to intervene. However, the petitioner was locked up\n\nin the house and the visitors were not allowed to enter the house.\n\nIn brief, the case of the petitioner is that the entire action was a\n\nresult of political vendetta. An illegal search was carried out\n\ndespite the refusal to grant permission by the Judicial Magistrate.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_23\">14.          Now as such by filing this petition, the petitioner\n\nsought a direction upon the respondents to compensate him by\n\npaying Rs.10 lakhs as a public law remedy for violation of the\n\npetitioners&#x27; fundamental right to free movement &amp; expression,\n\nright to privacy, right to life and health and right to liberty\n\nguaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_13\">Article 19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/655638/\" id=\"a_14\">20</a> of the Constitution of India.\n\nThe Petitioner has also sought direction upon the respondents to\n\nensure the safety and security to the Petitioner.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_24\">15.          On the other hand, the case of the respondents is\n\nthat the petitioner has un-authorizedly used the Ashok Chakra, the\n\nNational Emblem while making malicious and false complaints\n\nagainst the then Chief Minister of Tripura. Even during the search\n\nof the premises of the petitioner by the search team, 10(ten) blank\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                Page 9 of 27</span>\n\n\n\n\npads having Letterhead with National Emblem symbol printed on it\n\nand scripted as:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">       &quot; Gopal Chandra Roy, Ex-MLA,\n         Advisor Tripura State Congress Committee,\n         President Tripura State Olympic Association,\n         Ex-President, Tripura Pradesh Congress Committee,\n         Ex-CLP Leader, Tripura,\n         Advocate, Tripura High Court,\n         Owner and Editor of Ganasambad Patrika&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_25\">16.           Mr. P. Roy Barman, learned Sr. counsel assisted by\n\nMr. K. Nath, Advocate appearing for the petitioner submits that on\n\n05.04.2020,    the   learned   Judicial   Magistrate   1st   Class   while\n\nconsidering the prayer for the issuing search warrant has recorded\n\nthat, no preliminary investigation has been conducted by the I.O.\n\nand the learned Court did not found any material based on which\n\nsearch warrant can be issued. Later Addl. Chief Judicial Magistrate\n\non 06.04.2020, rejected the prayer for the issuance of the search\n\nwarrant. But by conducting the illegal search on 05.04.2020, the\n\nrespondents showed utter contempt to the learned Magisterial\n\nCourt and showed disrespect to the Court. After perusing the case\n\nrecord and after hearing the learned Addl. P.P., the learned Judicial\n\nMagistrate 1st Class, did not find any material to issue the search\n\nwarrant, as no preliminary investigation was carried out by the I.O.\n\nThe respondents on that day itself caused an illegal search in the\n\nhouse of the petitioner ignoring the salutary observation of the\n\nlearned Court, that, issuance of the search warrant is not an empty\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                               Page 10 of 27</span>\n\n\n\n\nformality and as search causes loss of prestige and fame to the\n\nperson, whose premises is searched. Despite such observation of\n\nthe learned Court, the respondents were so desperate and\n\narrogant, that, on that day, the respondents conducted an illegal\n\nsearch, subjecting to petitioners&#x27; illegal detention, harassment, etc.\n\nThe respondents&#x27; defended the search by invoking <a href=\"/doc/996365/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 165</a> of\n\nthe Cr.P.C. But in the counter affidavit, there is no whisper as to\n\nwhether the conditions imposed in <a href=\"/doc/996365/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 165</a> were fulfilled. One\n\nof the basic precondition of invoking <a href=\"/doc/996365/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 165</a> of Cr.P.C. is that\n\nthe I.O. records in writing the grounds of his belief that search is\n\nimmediately called for and specify in writing as far as possible, the\n\nthings for which search is made. From the counter affidavit, it is\n\nclear that said preconditions have been given a complete goodbye.\n\nMoreover, Condition-(i) of <a href=\"/doc/996365/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 165</a> of Cr.P.C. as stated above,\n\nwas not also attracted as the I.O. could not have reasonable\n\nground, that investigation cannot be carried on otherwise than by\n\nmaking a search without undue delay because the learned Judicial\n\nMagistrate 1st class on 05.04.2020, itself after perusing the case\n\nrecord and prayer for issuing the search came to the specific\n\nfinding that no preliminary investigation has been conducted by\n\nthe I.O., and the learned Court below was of the view that, there is\n\nnothing on record which is brought out through investigation, that,\n\notherwise   than   by   making   a    search   without   undue   delay\n\ninvestigation cannot be carried out. The search of the house of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                  Page 11 of 27</span>\n\n\n\n\npetitioner was not called for, for the purpose of investigation and it\n\nwas not authorized by law. As such, the search is illegal &amp;\n\narbitrary. The illegal search and detention of the petitioner was an\n\ninfringement on the petitioner&#x27;s right to life &amp; liberty, including the\n\nright to privacy. For violation of fundamental rights, the petitioner\n\nis entitled to monetary compensation payable by the respondents\n\nunder public law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_26\">              <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"842696\" id=\"span_11\">To    support    his   argument,     learned    Sr.   counsel\n\nappearing for the petitioner pressed into service paras No.2 and\n\n7 of the Judgment of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court passed in case No\n\nCriminal Appeal No.39 of 1958 titled as <a href=\"/doc/842696/\" id=\"a_19\">The State of\n\nRajasthan Vs. Rehman</a>, which is reproduced here-in-under:-</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">               &quot;2. The material facts lie in a small compass. The Deputy\n   Superintendent of the Central Excise, having his head-quarters at\n   Bharatpur, received information that one Sulled and his son, Rehman,\n   the respondent herein, had cultivated tobacco but had not paid the\n   excise duty payable thereon. On September 9, 1953, the Deputy\n   Superintendent, accompanied by an Inspector of Central Excise, a\n   sepoy, a chowkidar and two motbirs went to the house of Rehman at 2\n   p.m., with a view to search his house to find out whether he had stored\n   tobacco there. When they declared their intention to do so, the\n   respondent and one Dhamman, it is alleged, obstructed the making of\n   the search; with the result that the Deputy Superintendent fell down\n   and received some injuries. The respondent and Dhamman were\n   prosecuted, and the Munsif-Magistrate, Hinduan, discharged Dhamman\n   but convicted the respondent under<a href=\"/doc/1208971/\" id=\"a_20\"> s. 353</a> of the Indian Penal Code and\n   sentenced him to undergo three months&#x27; rigorous imprisonment. On\n   appeal, the Additional Sessions Judge came to the conclusion that on\n   the material then available the search had not been conducted in\n   accordance with<a href=\"/doc/996365/\" id=\"a_21\"> s. 165</a> of the Criminal Procedure Code and remanded\n   the case for fresh enquiry. On remand, the Munsif-Magistrate found that\n   the search was made by the Deputy Superintendent without recording\n   the reasons as he should under<a href=\"/doc/996365/\" id=\"a_22\"> s. 165</a> of the Criminal Procedure Code\n   and that the respondent in obstructing him from making the illegal\n   search did not commit any offence, and, on that finding, the acquitted\n   the respondent. On appeal, the High Court agreed with the view\n   expressed by the Munsif-Magistrate and confirmed the order of\n   acquittal. The State of Rajasthan preferred the present appeal\n   questioning the correctness of the decision of the High Court.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                 Page 12 of 27</span>\n\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">            7. Now we shall look at the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_23\">Criminal\nProcedure Code</a> to ascertain which of its provisions regulating the mode\nof search are appropriate to the power conferred on the Deputy\nSuperintendent under r. 201 of the Rules. In the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_24\">Criminal Procedure\nCode</a>d there are four groups of sections regulating the searches\nauthorised under it. <a href=\"/doc/249603/\" id=\"a_25\">Sections 47</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1464344/\" id=\"a_26\">48</a>, <a href=\"/doc/379241/\" id=\"a_27\">51</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1601812/\" id=\"a_28\">52</a> appear in Ch. V of the\nCode which provides for the arrest, escape and retaking of persons.\n<a href=\"/doc/249603/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 47</a> provides for the search of a place entered by persons sought\nto be arrested; s. 48 for procedure where ingress is not obtainable; and<a href=\"/doc/379241/\" id=\"a_30\">\nss. 51</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1601812/\" id=\"a_31\">52</a> for the search of the arrested persons. The second group\nconsists of<a href=\"/doc/1137396/\" id=\"a_32\"> ss. 100</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1250824/\" id=\"a_33\">101</a>, <a href=\"/doc/648213/\" id=\"a_34\">102</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1134540/\" id=\"a_35\">103</a> of Ch. VII of the Code. <a href=\"/doc/1137396/\" id=\"a_36\">Section\n100</a> deals with the search for persons wrongfully confined, and the other\nsections are general provisions relating to search warrants, duties of\npersons in charge of closed places and the requisitioning of persons to\nwitness searches. <a href=\"/doc/1009986/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 153</a> forms the third group and it falls under\nCh. XIII of the Code which provides for the preventive action of the\npolice. Under<a href=\"/doc/1009986/\" id=\"a_38\"> s. 153</a>, a police officer can make a search without a\nwarrant for the purpose of inspecting or searching for any weights or\nmeasures or instruments for weighing used or kept within the limits of\nhis station, if he has reason to believe that the weights etc. are false.\nThe fourth group of sections appear in Ch. XIV which provides for\nsearches by a police officer during the investigation of a cognizable\noffence. The power of search given under this chapter is incidental to\nthe conduct of investigation the police officer is authorized by law to\nmake. Under<a href=\"/doc/996365/\" id=\"a_39\"> s. 165</a> four conditions are imposed : (i) the police officer\nmust have reasonable ground for believing that anything necessary for\nthe purposes of an investigation of an offence cannot, in his opinion, be\nobtained otherwise than by making a search, without undue delay; (ii)\nhe should record in writing the grounds of his belief and specify in such\nwriting as far as possible the things for which the search is to be made;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">(ii) he must conduct the search, if practicable, in person; and (iv) if it is\nnot practicable to make the search himself, he must record in writing\nthe reasons for not himself making the search and shall authorize a\nsubordinate officer to make the search after specifying in writing the\nplace to be searched, and, so far as possible, the thing for which search\nis to be made. As search is a process exceedingly arbitrary in character,\nstringent statutory conditions are imposed on the exercise of the power.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_27\">A comparative study of the aforesaid provisions with the provisions of r.\n201 of the Rules indicates that searches made by a police officer during\nthe course of an investigation of a cognizable offence can properly be\napproximated with the searches to be made by the authorized officer\nunder r. 201 of the rules; for, in the former case, the police officer\nmakes a search during the investigation of a cognizable office and in the\nlatter the authorized officer makes the search to ascertain whether a\nperson contravened the provisions of the Act or the Rules which is an\noffence. There is also no reason why conditions should be imposed in\nthe matter of a search by the police officer under<a href=\"/doc/996365/\" id=\"a_40\"> s. 165</a> of the code, but\nno such safe-guard need be provided in the case of a search by the\nexcises under the Rules. We think that the legislature, by stating in s.\n18 of the Act that the searches under the Act and the Rules shall be\ncarried out in accordance with the provisions of the Code relating to\nsearches, clearly indicated that the appropriate provisions of the Code\nshall govern searches authorized under the Act and the Rules. We\ntherefore hold that the provisions of<a href=\"/doc/996365/\" id=\"a_41\"> s. 165</a> of the Code must be\nfollowed in the matter of searches under<a href=\"/doc/454689/\" id=\"a_42\"> s. 201</a> of the Rules.&quot;\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                                  Page 13 of 27</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_28\">17.           On the other hand, Mr. S. Kar. Bhowmik, Spl. Public\n\nProsecutor appearing for the State-respondents contended that\n\nthis search was justified due to the finding of the letterhead with\n\nthe National Emblem printed in the left corner of it. According to\n\nTHE STATE EMBLEM OF INDIA (PROHIBITION OF IMPROPER USE)\n\nACT, 2005 and State Emblem of India(Regulation of Use) Rules\n\n2007, the petitioner cannot use the same as he was an ex-MLA at\n\nthe time of the incident and he is not allowed to use the National\n\nemblem. No wrong was committed by the investigating agency.\n\nFurther a criminal case that has been lodged against the petitioner\n\nfor improper use of the State Emblem is under investigation and\n\nthere   is   no   prayer   for   quashing        the   same.   As   such   no\n\ncompensation can be granted to petitioner until the unless the\n\ncriminal case is alive. In the grab of getting compensation, the\n\npetitioner is trying to put a death nail on the criminal proceeding\n\nbecause without quashing the criminal case, compensation cannot\n\nbe granted. The petitioner is a man of big stature and the\n\npetitioner himself submitted that when police went to his premises\n\nfor search, all the senior members of the political party went to his\n\nhouse. So naturally a large police force was needed to maintain the\n\nlaw and order and to conduct the search peacefully. Accordingly,\n\nsufficient police were present and conducted search without\n\ninfringing the rights of the petitioner.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                                  Page 14 of 27</span><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_29\">\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_30\">              He further argued that in the Case Dairy, on pages\n\nNo. 4, 17, 21, and especially on page- 38, a detailed reasoning has\n\nbeen given for making the search and they have not violated\n\n<a href=\"/doc/996365/\" id=\"a_43\">Section 165</a> of Cr.P.C. and other provisions of law. Also at the time\n\nof the search, the I.O. of the case seized 10(ten) blank pads\n\nhaving letterhead scripted as:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">        &quot; Gopal Chandra Roy, Ex-MLA,\n          Advisor Tripura State Congress Committee,\n          President Tripura State Olympic Association,\n          Ex-President, Tripura Pradesh Congress Committee,\n          Ex-CLP Leader, Tripura,\n          Advocate, Tripura High Court,\n          Owner and Editor of Ganasambad Patrika&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_31\">              With the symbol of the National Emblem printed on\n\nthe left corner of the letter pad.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_32\">              <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"151065156\" id=\"span_15\">To support his argument, Mr. S.

From the impugned common judgment and order\n    passed by the High Court, it appears that the High Court has dealt with\n    the proceedings before it, as if, the High Court was conducting a mini\n    trial and/or the High Court was considering the applications against the\n    judgment and order passed by the learned Trial Court on conclusion of\n    trial.

Therefore, the High Court has erred in\n      observing at this stage that the initiation of the criminal proceedings /\n      proceedings is malicious. Whether the criminal proceedings was/were\n      malicious or not, is not required to be considered at this stage. The\n      same is required to be considered at the conclusion of the trial. In any\n      case, at this stage, what is required to be considered is a prima facie\n      case and the material collected during the course of the investigation,\n      which warranted the accused to be tried.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">                       12. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"151065156\" id=\"span_17\">In view of the above and for the reasons stated\n      above, when the High Court has exceeded in its jurisdiction in\n      quashing the entire criminal proceedings and applying the law <a href=\"/doc/151065156/\" id=\"a_48\">laid\n      down by</a> this Court in catena of decisions on exercise of the powers at\n      the stage of discharge and/or quashing the criminal proceedings, the\n      impugned common judgment and order passed by the High Court\n      quashing the criminal proceedings against the accused is unsustainable\n      and the same deserves to be quashed and set aside. &quot;</span>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_33\">18.

The material facts lie in a small compass. The\n   Deputy Superintendent of the Central Excise, having his head-quarters\n   at Bharatpur, received information that one Sulled and his son,\n   Rehman, the respondent herein, had cultivated tobacco but had not paid\n   the excise duty payable thereon. On September 9, 1953, the Deputy\n   Superintendent, accompanied by an Inspector of Central Excise, a\n   sepoy, a chowkidar and two motbirs went to the house of Rehman at 2\n   p.m., with a view to search his house to find out whether he had stored\n   tobacco there. When they declared their intention to do so, the\n   respondent and one Dhamman, it is alleged, obstructed the making of\n   the search; with the result that the Deputy Superintendent fell down\n   and received some injuries. The respondent and Dhamman were\n   prosecuted, and the Munsif-Magistrate, Hinduan, discharged Dhamman\n   but convicted the respondent under<a href=\"/doc/1208971/\" id=\"a_58\"> s. 353</a> of the Indian Penal Code and\n   sentenced him to undergo three months&#x27; rigorous imprisonment. On\n   appeal, the Additional Sessions Judge came to the conclusion that on\n   the material then available the search had not been conducted in\n   accordance with<a href=\"/doc/996365/\" id=\"a_59\"> s. 165</a> of the Criminal Procedure Code and remanded\n   the case for fresh enquiry. On remand, the Munsif-Magistrate found that\n   the search was made by the Deputy Superintendent without recording\n   the reasons as he should under<a href=\"/doc/996365/\" id=\"a_60\"> s. 165</a> of the Criminal Procedure Code\n   and that the respondent in obstructing him from making the illegal\n   search did not commit any offence, and, on that finding, the acquitted\n   the respondent. On appeal, the High Court agreed with the view\n   expressed by the Munsif-Magistrate and confirmed the order of\n   acquittal. The State of Rajasthan preferred the present appeal\n   questioning the correctness of the decision of the High Court.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_49\">               7. Now we shall look at the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_61\">Criminal\n   Procedure Code</a> to ascertain which of its provisions regulating the mode\n   of search are appropriate to the power conferred on the Deputy\n   Superintendent under r. 201 of the Rules. In the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_62\">Criminal Procedure\n   Code</a>d there are four groups of sections regulating the searches\n   authorised under it. <a href=\"/doc/249603/\" id=\"a_63\">Sections 47</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1464344/\" id=\"a_64\">48</a>, <a href=\"/doc/379241/\" id=\"a_65\">51</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1601812/\" id=\"a_66\">52</a> appear in Ch. V of the\n   Code which provides for the arrest, escape and retaking of persons.\n   <a href=\"/doc/249603/\" id=\"a_67\">Section 47</a> provides for the search of a place entered by persons sought\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">                                   Page 20 of 27</span>\n\n\n\n\n  to be arrested; s. 48 for procedure where ingress is not obtainable; and\n  ss. 51 and 52 for the search of the arrested persons. The second group\n  consists of<a href=\"/doc/1137396/\" id=\"a_68\"> ss. 100</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1250824/\" id=\"a_69\">101</a>, <a href=\"/doc/648213/\" id=\"a_70\">102</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1134540/\" id=\"a_71\">103</a> of Ch. VII of the Code. <a href=\"/doc/1137396/\" id=\"a_72\">Section\n  100</a> deals with the search for persons wrongfully confined, and the other\n  sections are general provisions relating to search warrants, duties of\n  persons in charge of closed places and the requisitioning of persons to\n  witness searches. <a href=\"/doc/1009986/\" id=\"a_73\">Section 153</a> forms the third group and it falls under\n  Ch. XIII of the Code which provides for the preventive action of the\n  police. Under<a href=\"/doc/1009986/\" id=\"a_74\"> s. 153</a>, a police officer can make a search without a\n  warrant for the purpose of inspecting or searching for any weights or\n  measures or instruments for weighing used or kept within the limits of\n  his station, if he has reason to believe that the weights etc. are false.\n  The fourth group of sections appear in Ch. XIV which provides for\n  searches by a police officer during the investigation of a cognizable\n  offence. The power of search given under this chapter is incidental to\n  the conduct of investigation the police officer is authorized by law to\n  make. Under<a href=\"/doc/996365/\" id=\"a_75\"> s. 165</a> four conditions are imposed : (i) the police officer\n  must have reasonable ground for believing that anything necessary for\n  the purposes of an investigation of an offence cannot, in his opinion, be\n  obtained otherwise than by making a search, without undue delay; (ii)\n  he should record in writing the grounds of his belief and specify in such\n  writing as far as possible the things for which the search is to be made;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_50\">  (ii) he must conduct the search, if practicable, in person; and (iv) if it is\n  not practicable to make the search himself, he must record in writing\n  the reasons for not himself making the search and shall authorize a\n  subordinate officer to make the search after specifying in writing the\n  place to be searched, and, so far as possible, the thing for which search\n  is to be made. As search is a process exceedingly arbitrary in character,\n  stringent statutory conditions are imposed on the exercise of the power.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_52\">  A comparative study of the aforesaid provisions with the provisions of r.\n  201 of the Rules indicates that searches made by a police officer during\n  the course of an investigation of a cognizable offence can properly be\n  approximated with the searches to be made by the authorized officer\n  under r. 201 of the rules; for, in the former case, the police officer\n  makes a search during the investigation of a cognizable office and in the\n  latter the authorized officer makes the search to ascertain whether a\n  person contravened the provisions of the Act or the Rules which is an\n  offence. There is also no reason why conditions should be imposed in\n  the matter of a search by the police officer under<a href=\"/doc/996365/\" id=\"a_76\"> s. 165</a> of the code, but\n  no such safe-guard need be provided in the case of a search by the\n  excises under the Rules. We think that the legislature, by stating in s.\n  18 of the Act that the searches under the Act and the Rules shall be\n  carried out in accordance with the provisions of the Code relating to\n  searches, clearly indicated that the appropriate provisions of the Code\n  shall govern searches authorized under the Act and the Rules. We\n  therefore hold that the provisions of<a href=\"/doc/996365/\" id=\"a_77\"> s. 165</a> of the Code must be\n  followed in the matter of searches under<a href=\"/doc/454689/\" id=\"a_78\"> s. 201</a> of the Rules.&quot;\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_53\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"151065156\" id=\"span_23\">24.

Having gone through the impugned common\n      judgment and order passed by the High Court quashing the criminal\n      proceedings and discharging the accused, we are of the opinion that\n      the High Court has exceeded in its jurisdiction in quashing the entire\n      criminal proceedings in exercise of the limited powers under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_81\">Section\n      482</a> Cr.P.C. and/or in exercise of the powers under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_82\">Article 226</a> of the\n      Constitution of India.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_52\">                        10. From the impugned common judgment and order\n      passed by the High Court, it appears that the High Court has dealt with\n      the proceedings before it, as if, the High Court was conducting a mini\n      trial and/or the High Court was considering the applications against the\n      judgment and order passed by the learned Trial Court on conclusion of\n      trial. As per the cardinal principle of law, at the stage of discharge\n      and/or quashing of the criminal proceedings, while exercising the\n      powers under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_83\">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C., the Court is not required to conduct\n      the mini trial............\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_53\">      11......... Therefore, the High Court has erred in observing at this stage\n      that the initiation of the criminal proceedings / proceedings is\n      malicious. Whether the criminal proceedings was/were malicious or\n      not, is not required to be considered at this stage. The same is\n      required to be considered at the conclusion of the trial. In any case, at\n      this stage, what is required to be considered is a prima facie case and\n      the material collected during the course of the investigation, which\n      warranted the accused to be tried.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_54\">                       12. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"151065156\" id=\"span_25\">In view of the above and for the reasons stated\n      above, when the High Court has exceeded in its jurisdiction in\n      quashing the entire criminal proceedings and applying the law <a href=\"/doc/151065156/\" id=\"a_84\">laid\n      down by</a> this Court in catena of decisions on exercise of the powers at\n      the stage of discharge and/or quashing the criminal proceedings, the\n      impugned common judgment and order passed by the High Court\n      quashing the criminal proceedings against the accused is unsustainable\n      and the same deserves to be quashed and set aside. &quot;</span>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_54\">25.

In      view   of   the    facts     and\n\ncircumstances, the compensation can only be claimed before the\n\ncompetent Civil Court but not in writ Court. This Court has not\n\nexpressed     any     opinion   that   the       petitioner   is    entitled    to\n\ncompensation or otherwise.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_65\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_66\">32.           This Court is of the opinion that no case has been\n\nmade out for compensation and no relief can be granted under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_94\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India. It is premature to even\n\nconsider the request for compensation as the allegations made by\n\nthe petitioner are not established and substantiated. Disputed\n\nquestions of facts cannot be gone into in a petition filed under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_95\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India. The petitioner made an\n\nallegation that 200 armed police personnel raided his premises on\n\n5th April 2020 but prima facie the allegation has not been\n\nestablished. According to the prosecution, the petitioner made a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">                              Page 26 of 27</span>\n\n\n\n\ncomplaint on a letterhead with the National Emblem printed in the\n\nleft corner of it. On search of the premises of the petitioner, the\n\npolice seized 10(ten) blank pads having the said letterheads\n\nscripted on them. The said fact has not been denied by the\n\npetitioner. The petitioner in his pleading has not explained the\n\nphysical and mental harassment as alleged by him. The petitioner\n\nhas not even made out how <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_96\">Articles 19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_97\">21</a> of the Constitution\n\nof India are infringed by the respondents and the same has not\n\nbeen explained. It is seen from the record that there was no order\n\nrestraining the search made by the respondents on 05.04.2020,\n\ntherefore, it cannot be said that the said search was illegal. The\n\npetitioner herein also has made contradictory statements; on one\n\nhand, he accuses the then Chief Minister of Tripura, Sri Biplab\n\nKumar Deb of giving fake information on COVID-19 infections, and\n\non the other hand, the petitioner contends that during the COVID\n\nperiod, so many police officers raided his premises; causing likely\n\nhood of spreading COVID. Thus, if there is COVID, the statement\n\nof the then Chief Minister of Tripura is correct. If there is no\n\nCOVID, the allegation of the petitioner that during COVID period,\n\n200 police personnel raided his premises causing likely hood of\n\nspreading COVID fails.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_67\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_68\">33.          In so far as the relief claimed to provide security and\n\nsafety in concerned, it is always open for the petitioner to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">                                  Page 27 of 27</span>\n\n\n\n\napproach the concerned authority as per procedure. Since no\n\nspecific case is made out ventilating the endangering of life\n\nrequiring security and safety measures, no relief can be granted\n\nand thus prayer stands rejected with the above observation.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_69\">34.               In view of the above discussion this Court is of the\n\nopinion that the present writ petition is devoid of merits and the\n\nsame is liable to be dismissed and thus it is accordingly dismissed.\n\nAs a sequel, stay if any stands vacated and pending application(s),\n\nif any also stands closed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_70\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_71\">                                                      JUDGE\n\n\n\n\nsuhanjit\n\n\n RAJKUMAR Digitally\n          RAJKUMAR\n                    signed by\n\n SUHANJIT SUHANJIT SINGHA\n          Date: 2023.09.15\n SINGHA   15:59:16 +05&#x27;30&#x27;\n </p>","numcites":26,"numcitedby":0,"docsource":"Tripura High Court","citetid":23496879,"divtype":"judgments","relatedqs":[{"value":"right to health","formInput":"right%20to%20health"},{"value":"right to privacy ","formInput":"right%20to%20privacy%20"},{"value":"constitution of india articles","formInput":"constitution%20of%20india%20articles"},{"value":"article 21","formInput":"article%2021"},{"value":"right to life","formInput":"right%20to%20life"},{"value":"quashing of criminal proceedings ","formInput":"quashing%20of%20criminal%20proceedings%20"},{"value":"crpc 165","formInput":"crpc%20165"},{"value":"right to free movement","formInput":"right%20to%20free%20movement"},{"value":"article 19","formInput":"article%2019"},{"value":"search warrant","formInput":"search%20warrant"},{"value":"proceedings when can be quashed ","formInput":"proceedings%20when%20can%20be%20quashed%20"},{"value":"public law remedy","formInput":"public%20law%20remedy"},{"value":"reasonable restriction","formInput":"reasonable%20restriction"},{"value":"mini trial","formInput":"mini%20trial"},{"value":"privacy","formInput":"privacy"},{"value":"Criminal writ petition ","formInput":"Criminal%20writ%20petition%20"},{"value":"mandamus","formInput":"mandamus"},{"value":"covid","formInput":"covid"},{"value":"sovereignty","formInput":"sovereignty"},{"value":"public order","formInput":"public%20order"}],"cats":[{"value":"power-high-court-for-quashing","formInput":"tag:power-high-court-for-quashing"},{"value":"appeal-high-court < writ-petition-high-court","formInput":"tag:appeal-high-court < writ-petition-high-court"},{"value":"freedom-with-reasonable-restrictions","formInput":"tag:freedom-with-reasonable-restrictions"},{"value":"protection-of-life-and-liberty","formInput":"tag:protection-of-life-and-liberty"},{"value":"person-in-charge-to-allow-search","formInput":"tag:person-in-charge-to-allow-search"}],"courtcopy":true,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
