In this regard, it is stated that in fact\n            there is no objective consideration was done by the respondents on the\n            representations submitted by the applicants herein. The direction issued by\n            the Hon‟ble High Court of Gujarat was to the effect that the respondents\n            before actually apply its mind and considering the request in accordance with\n            law on examining the individual cases of each applicant and the respondents\nAhmedabad\n  Bench     must not be hurried to relieve the applicants.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_56\">                  In view of this, it is submitted that had there been examination of\n            individual case by the respondents then individual orders dealing with the\n            grievances individually would have been passed by a separate order. Thus,\n            there is no examination of individual cases by the respondents, as can be\n            seen from the impugned common order all such Inspectors, including the\n            applicants working in Vadodara Zone.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_57\">            6.1   Learned counsel for the applicants would argue that the wife of one of\n            the applicants is as such serving in Gujarat, thus, on spouse ground, his case\n            is required to be considered and he should be retained at the existing place of\n            working in light of the DOP&amp;T‟s guidelines on the subject as well the\n            judgment rendered by the Hon‟ble Apex Court in true letter and spirit.\n            Further, the wife of the applicant no.19 is working in ONCG Ahmedabad\n            and hence on spouse ground, he requested for ICT by letter dated 4.3.2016\n            accepting the same, he has been transferred to Vadodara Zone. In spite of\n            said applicant submitted his representation dated 4.11.2022 requesting that\n            he should be retained on spouse ground, but without adverting of the said\n            grievance of the above applicant, the respondents in a mechanical manner\n            passed the impugned common order rejecting the representations of the\n            applicants. Therefore, it is not correct on the part of the respondents to state\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                      2025.06.12\n                                                                          P ANUKUMA\n                                                                                      17:27:29+05&#x27;30&#x27;\n                                             ::22 ::                  OA Nos. 478 &amp; 485/2022\n\n\n\n\n            that by considering each/individual representations of the applicants, they\n            have rejected the said each representation by speaking order. As such as\n            demonstrated here, it is crystal clear that the respondents failed to consider\n            the representations of the applicants individually and thereby not complied\n            with the directions issued by the Hon‟ble High Court of Gujarat.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_58\">            6.2    Learned counsel for the applicants would argue that even after the\n            circular dated 20.9.2018, the respondent - Board has approved Inter\n            Commissionerate Transfer on spouse ground in the case of one Ms. Aditi\n            Chakorbarty, that too not on loan basis. In this regard, learned counsel\n            reliance has been made on the information supplied by the respondents under\n            <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_28\">Right to Information Act</a> (Annexure R/6 to the rejoinder). Whereas, in the\n            case(s) of the applicant(s), there exists spouse ground, the same has been\nAhmedabad\n  Bench     conveniently ignored by the respondents while passing the impugned order.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_59\">            6.3   Further it is submitted that in the cadre of Stenographer Grade II under\n            the respondent - Board, the absorption is not one of the mode of recruitments\n            like Inspectors. However, such Stenographer Grade II officers who came\n            under ICT to Jaipur Zone have been granted promotion as Stenographer\n            Grade I notionally. Thus, the respondents have permitted the ITC beneficiary\n            in the said cadre to receive all promotional benefits .Therefore, it can be seen\n            that the respondents have acted as per their own sweet will and wish rather\n            than applying the uniform methods in all the cadres in respect to transfer of\n            their employees.

As noted above, learned counsel for the applicants has rightly\n            demonstrated that none of compelling circumstances as stated by the\n            applicants in their individual representations have been considered by the\n            respondent no.4 while rejecting the representations by common order and\n            there is no whisper at all in this regard in the common impugned order. As\n            such we are in agreement with the contention of the learned counsel for the\n            applicants that impugned order passed by respondent no.4 without\n            considering the judicial directives of both the Hon‟ble Supreme Court and\n            the Hon‟ble High Court, which mandated case-by-case consideration, hence,\n            the decision making process on the part of respondent no.4 suffers from the\n            legal infirmities.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_83\">            <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"14222497\" id=\"span_15\">14.
