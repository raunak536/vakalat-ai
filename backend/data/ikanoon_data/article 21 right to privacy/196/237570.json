Excise Commissioner H.P.</a> The Supreme Court held that when rule making power of the judiciary is concerned, it is ‘state’.<br class=\"akn-br\"/><br class=\"akn-br\"/>There have been contrary opinions on this subject too. In <a class=\"akn-ref\" data-eid=\"part_III__sec_12__p_2__ref_6\" data-href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/12756/\" href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/12756/\" id=\"part_III__sec_12__p_2__ref_6\">Rati Lal v. State of Bombay</a>, it was held that the judiciary is not state for the purpose of Article 12. In <a class=\"akn-ref\" data-eid=\"part_III__sec_12__p_2__ref_7\" data-href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1353689/\" href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1353689/\" id=\"part_III__sec_12__p_2__ref_7\">A.R.Antulay v.

State of Maharashtra</a>, it has been observed that “when rule making power of judiciary is concerned it is state but when exercise of judicial power is concerned it is not state.”<br class=\"akn-br\"/><br class=\"akn-br\"/>Thus, the word 'state' under Article 12 jurisprudence has evolved in India through various interpretations and discussions in the High courts and the Supreme court. It has been given a wider meaning which ensures that Part-III of the constitution can be applied to a larger extent. <br class=\"akn-br\"/><br class=\"akn-br\"/>References<br class=\"akn-br\"/><br class=\"akn-br\"/><a class=\"akn-ref\" data-eid=\"part_III__sec_12__p_2__ref_9\" data-href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/609139/\" href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/609139/\" id=\"part_III__sec_12__p_2__ref_9\">Indiankanoon</a><br class=\"akn-br\"/><br class=\"akn-br\"/><a class=\"akn-ref\" data-eid=\"part_III__sec_12__p_2__ref_10\" data-href=\"https://constitutionofindia.net/articles/article-12-definitions/\" href=\"https://constitutionofindia.net/articles/article-12-definitions/\" id=\"part_III__sec_12__p_2__ref_10\">ConstitutionofIndia.net</a><br class=\"akn-br\"/><br class=\"akn-br\"/><a class=\"akn-ref\" data-eid=\"part_III__sec_12__p_2__ref_11\" data-href=\"https://knowindia.india.gov.in/profile/fundamental-rights.php\" href=\"https://knowindia.india.gov.in/profile/fundamental-rights.php\" id=\"part_III__sec_12__p_2__ref_11\">Know India Government Portal</a><br class=\"akn-br\"/><br class=\"akn-br\"/><a class=\"akn-ref\" data-eid=\"part_III__sec_12__p_2__ref_12\" data-href=\"https://blog.ipleaders.in/state-article-12-constitution-india/\" href=\"https://blog.ipleaders.in/state-article-12-constitution-india/\" id=\"part_III__sec_12__p_2__ref_12\">Blog Ipleaders</a><br class=\"akn-br\"/><br class=\"akn-br\"/><a class=\"akn-ref\" data-eid=\"part_III__sec_12__p_2__ref_13\" data-href=\"https://legalserviceindia.com/article/l271-Article-12.html\" href=\"https://legalserviceindia.com/article/l271-Article-12.html\" id=\"part_III__sec_12__p_2__ref_13\">Legal Service India</a> </span></span></span></section><section class=\"akn-section\" id=\"section_13\"><h3><a href=\"/doc/134715/\">13.</a> Laws inconsistent with or in derogation of the fundamental rights</h3>\n<section class=\"akn-subsection\" id=\"section_13.1\"><span class=\"akn-num\"><a href=\"/doc/1010805/\">(1)</a></span><span class=\"akn-content\"><span class=\"akn-p\">All laws in force in the territory of India immediately before the commencement of this Constitution, in so far as they are inconsistent with the provisions of this Pan, shall, to the extent of such inconsistency, be void.</span></span></section><section class=\"akn-subsection\" id=\"section_13.2\"><span class=\"akn-num\"><a href=\"/doc/772605/\">(2)</a></span><span class=\"akn-content\"><span class=\"akn-p\">The State shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the rights conferred by this Part and any law made in contravention of this clause shall, to the extent of the contravention, be void.</span></span></section><section class=\"akn-subsection\" id=\"section_13.3\"><span class=\"akn-num\"><a href=\"/doc/654960/\">(3)</a></span><span class=\"akn-intro\"><span class=\"akn-p\">In this article, unless the context otherwise requires,-</span></span><section class=\"akn-paragraph\" id=\"section_13.3.a\"><span class=\"akn-num\"><a href=\"/doc/15421639/\">(a)</a></span><span class=\"akn-content\"><span class=\"akn-p\">\"law\" includes any Ordinance, order, bye-law, rule, regulation, notification, custom or usage having in the territory of India the force of law;</span></span></section><section class=\"akn-paragraph\" id=\"section_13.3.b\"><span class=\"akn-num\"><a href=\"/doc/95003376/\">(b)</a></span><span class=\"akn-content\"><span class=\"akn-p\">\"laws in force\" includes laws passed or made by Legislature or other competent authority in the territory of India before the commencement of this Constitution and not previously repealed, notwithstanding that any such law or any part thereof may not be then in operation either at all or in particular areas.</span></span></section></section><section class=\"akn-subsection\" id=\"section_13.4\"><span class=\"akn-num\"><a href=\"/doc/430906/\">(4)</a></span><span class=\"akn-content\"><span class=\"akn-p\">Nothing in this article shall apply to any amendment of this Constitution made under article 368.</span><span class=\"akn-p\"><span class=\"akn-remark\" data-status=\"editorial\">[<b class=\"akn-b\">Editorial comment</b> - ​Article 13 (1) discusses the laws which were made before the commencement of the Constitution (26 January 1950) and Article 13 (2) delves about the laws which are made after the Constitution is in place.<br class=\"akn-br\"/><br class=\"akn-br\"/>​Article 13 (1) states that all the laws which are made before the Constitution will be void as long as they are violating the provisions of the Fundamental Rights. It further states that only that part of the law which will be void which is against the provisions of the constitution and not the whole law itself. This guarantee is against the existing laws and future laws and not to the laws which are made before the commencement of the constitution.<br class=\"akn-br\"/><br class=\"akn-br\"/>​Article 13(2) states that all the laws which are made after the commencement of the Constitution are void to the extent of the infringement of the Fundamental Rights given in part 3 of the Constitution.<br class=\"akn-br\"/><br class=\"akn-br\"/>The ‘Doctrine of Eclipse’ asserts that all the Pre-Constitutional laws which are against the fundamental rights of the Indian Constitution will become dormant and not dead.

According to this section, Law includes any ordinance, order, bye-Law, rule, regulation, notification, custom or usages. This definition of law is given a wide meaning so that it can be added to a wide variety of state instrumentalities.<br class=\"akn-br\"/><br class=\"akn-br\"/>In <a class=\"akn-ref\" data-eid=\"part_III__sec_13__subsec_4__p_2__ref_4\" data-href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1743680/\" href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1743680/\" id=\"part_III__sec_13__subsec_4__p_2__ref_4\">Ahmedabad Women Action Group v.

The Bye-Laws made by the Cooperative Societies are also not part of the definition of Law.<br class=\"akn-br\"/><br class=\"akn-br\"/>There have also been other discussions on whether “Law” includes constitutional amendments. ​This question was first decided in the case of <a class=\"akn-ref\" data-eid=\"part_III__sec_13__subsec_4__p_2__ref_5\" data-href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1706770/\" href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1706770/\" id=\"part_III__sec_13__subsec_4__p_2__ref_5\">Shankari Prasad v. Union of India</a> AIR 1951. In that case, the Supreme Court held that the word law under Article 13(2) doesn’t include a constitutional amendment. This entailed that the Parliament has power to amend the Fundamental Rights according to their will.<br class=\"akn-br\"/><br class=\"akn-br\"/>​Later in the case of <a class=\"akn-ref\" data-eid=\"part_III__sec_13__subsec_4__p_2__ref_6\" data-href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/120358/\" href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/120358/\" id=\"part_III__sec_13__subsec_4__p_2__ref_6\">Golak Nath v. State of Punjab</a>, AIR 1967, the Supreme Court overruled the Shankari Prasad verdict and stated that the word ‘Law’ in Article 13(2) includes the constitutional amendments. If any constitutional amendment is infringing the Fundamental rights then that amendment will be void.<br class=\"akn-br\"/><br class=\"akn-br\"/>​To nullify the Golak Nath decision the Parliament passed the 24th Amendment Act, 1971, wherein parliament added Clause 4 in Article 13 which stated that nothing in Article 13 shall apply to any amendment of this Constitution made under Article 368.<br class=\"akn-br\"/><br class=\"akn-br\"/>​Later in the case of the<a class=\"akn-ref\" data-eid=\"part_III__sec_13__subsec_4__p_2__ref_7\" data-href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/257876/\" href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/257876/\" id=\"part_III__sec_13__subsec_4__p_2__ref_7\"> Kesavananda Bharati v. the State of Kerala,</a> AIR 1973, the constitutionality of the 24th Amendment was held valid. So the present position of the word “Law” is that a Constitutional Amendment does not include the word. This gives the Parliament the power to amend the provisions of the Fundamental rights as long as they align with the basic structure doctrine of the Indian Constitution.</span></span><span class=\"akn-p\">References</span><span class=\"akn-p\"><a class=\"akn-ref\" data-eid=\"part_III__sec_13__subsec_4__p_4__ref_1\" data-href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/134715/\" href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/134715/\" id=\"part_III__sec_13__subsec_4__p_4__ref_1\">IndianKanoon</a></span><span class=\"akn-p\"><a class=\"akn-ref\" data-eid=\"part_III__sec_13__subsec_4__p_5__ref_1\" data-href=\"https://blog.ipleaders.in/fundamental-rights-article-13/\" href=\"https://blog.ipleaders.in/fundamental-rights-article-13/\" id=\"part_III__sec_13__subsec_4__p_5__ref_1\">Blog Ipleaders</a></span><span class=\"akn-p\"><a class=\"akn-ref\" data-eid=\"part_III__sec_13__subsec_4__p_6__ref_1\" data-href=\"https://constitutionofindia.net/articles/article-13-laws-inconsistent-with-or-in-derogation-of-the-fundamental-rights/\" href=\"https://constitutionofindia.net/articles/article-13-laws-inconsistent-with-or-in-derogation-of-the-fundamental-rights/\" id=\"part_III__sec_13__subsec_4__p_6__ref_1\">ConstitutionofIndia.net</a></span><span class=\"akn-p\"><a class=\"akn-ref\" data-eid=\"part_III__sec_13__subsec_4__p_7__ref_1\" data-href=\"https://lawctopus.com/academike/article-13-analysis/\" href=\"https://lawctopus.com/academike/article-13-analysis/\" id=\"part_III__sec_13__subsec_4__p_7__ref_1\">Lawctopus Academike</a></span><span class=\"akn-p\"><a class=\"akn-ref\" data-eid=\"part_III__sec_13__subsec_4__p_8__ref_1\" data-href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_India\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_India\" id=\"part_III__sec_13__subsec_4__p_8__ref_1\">Wikipedia</a></span><span class=\"akn-p\">[<span class=\"akn-remark\" data-status=\"editorial\">[<b class=\"akn-b\">Editorial comment</b>-The Constitution (Twenty-Four Amendment) Act, 1971, enables Parliament to dilute Fundamental Rights through Amendments of the Constitution.Tthe 24th Amendment was effected to abrogate the Supreme Court ruling in <a class=\"akn-ref\" data-eid=\"part_III__sec_13__subsec_4__p_9__ref_1\" data-href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/120358/\" href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/120358/\" id=\"part_III__sec_13__subsec_4__p_9__ref_1\">I.C.

Whereas, equality before the law is a negative content, equal protection of the laws exhibits a positive content of Article 14.”<br class=\"akn-br\"/><br class=\"akn-br\"/>The doctrine of Anti Arbitrariness:  The scope of article 14 was drastically increased by the Supreme Court by including the executive discretion under its ambit. In the case of <a class=\"akn-ref\" data-eid=\"part_III__sec_14__p_2__ref_2\" data-href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1327287/\" href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1327287/\" id=\"part_III__sec_14__p_2__ref_2\">E.P. Royappa v. State of Tamil Nadu</a>, 1974, the court said that Article 14 gives a guarantee against the arbitrary actions of the State. The Right to Equality is against arbitrariness. They both are enemies to each other.

So this doctrine ensures equality of treatment. “The seven-Judge Bench held that a trinity exists between Article 14, Article 19 and Article 21. All these articles have to be read together. Any law interfering with personal liberty of a person must satisfy a triple test: (i) it must prescribe a procedure; (ii) the procedure must withstand the test of one or more of the fundamental rights conferred under Article 19 which may be applicable in a given situation; and (iii) it must also be liable to be tested with reference to Article 14.”<br class=\"akn-br\"/><br class=\"akn-br\"/>Natural Justice as a part of Article 14: From the case of <a class=\"akn-ref\" data-eid=\"part_III__sec_14__p_2__ref_5\" data-href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/639803/\" href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/639803/\" id=\"part_III__sec_14__p_2__ref_5\">A.K.

It simply permits the State to make differential classification of subjects (which would otherwise be prohibited by Article 14) provided that the classification is founded on intelligible differentia (i.e. objects within the class are clearly distinguishable from those that are outside) and has a rational nexus with the objective sought to be achieved by the classification.<br class=\"akn-br\"/><br class=\"akn-br\"/>In the case of<a class=\"akn-ref\" data-eid=\"part_III__sec_14__p_2__ref_7\" data-href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1363234/\" href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1363234/\" id=\"part_III__sec_14__p_2__ref_7\"> Indra Sawhney v UOI, 1993</a> which is a landmark judgment on aspects of reservation in India. “The Court interpreted the relation between Article 14 and Article 16.

The Constitution of India guarantees various rights to its citizens, including no discrimination on account of religion, race, caste, or place of birth. Article 15 restricts discrimination on the ground of:<br class=\"akn-br\"/><br class=\"akn-br\"/>Religion – It means that no person should be discriminated against on the basis of religion from accessing any public place or policy by the state or any group.<br class=\"akn-br\"/><br class=\"akn-br\"/>Race – Ethnic origin should not form a basis of discrimination. For example, a citizen of Afghan origin should not be discriminated against those of an Indian origin.<br class=\"akn-br\"/><br class=\"akn-br\"/>Caste – Discrimination on the basis of caste is also prohibited to prevent atrocities on the lower castes by the upper caste.<br class=\"akn-br\"/><br class=\"akn-br\"/>Sex – Gender of an individual shall not be a valid ground for discrimination in any matter.<br class=\"akn-br\"/><br class=\"akn-br\"/>Place of birth – A place where an individual is born should not become a reason for discriminating among other members of the country.<br class=\"akn-br\"/><br class=\"akn-br\"/>In the case of<a class=\"akn-ref\" data-eid=\"part_III__sec_15__subsec_6__wrapup__p_2__ref_1\" data-href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1949862/\" href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1949862/\" id=\"part_III__sec_15__subsec_6__wrapup__p_2__ref_1\">Kathi Raning Rawat v.

The contention brought before the court was that these provisions are discriminatory for the residents depending upon the territory.<br class=\"akn-br\"/><br class=\"akn-br\"/>The court stated that all kinds of legislative differentiation are not discriminatory. The legislation did not refer to certain individual cases but to offenses of certain kinds committed in certain areas and hence it is not discrimination.<br class=\"akn-br\"/><br class=\"akn-br\"/>In another significant case, <a class=\"akn-ref\" data-eid=\"part_III__sec_15__subsec_6__wrapup__p_2__ref_6\" data-href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/533870/\" href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/533870/\" id=\"part_III__sec_15__subsec_6__wrapup__p_2__ref_6\">John Vallamattom v. Union of India,</a> AIR 2003 SC 2902 discussed that The Indian Succession Act 1925 prevented the petitioners from bequeathing property for religious and charitable purposes. The petitioner contended it to be discriminatory against the testamentary dispositions by a Christian.<br class=\"akn-br\"/><br class=\"akn-br\"/>The court stated that the Act was to prevent people from making injudicious death-bed bequests under religious influence, but had a great impact on a person desiring to dispose of his property upon his death. Hence, the legislation is clearly discriminatory as the properties of any Hindu, Muslim, Buddhist, Sikh, Jain or Parsi were excluded from the provisions of the Act. Further, no acceptable reasoning was provided to show why the provision regulates religious and charitable bequests of Christians alone.<br class=\"akn-br\"/><br class=\"akn-br\"/>Clause 1 of the Article prohibits the State from discriminating against citizens on five protected grounds only. This means that if the discrimination is only on the basis of these 5 points then it will be void.<br class=\"akn-br\"/><br class=\"akn-br\"/>One of the important points to remember under this clause is that the prohibition is against the state and not against any private individuals. This clause is used to give horizontal reservations like reservations for visually impaired people.

This was held valid by the Supreme Court.<br class=\"akn-br\"/><br class=\"akn-br\"/>Clause 2 discussed Access to Public Places. This clause gives access to shops, public restaurants, hotels and places of public entertainment to all. This clause also makes wells, tanks, bathing Ghats, roads and places of public resort accessible for every citizen. This clause is applied not only to the state but also against the individuals. It is illegal and unjust to restrict or prevent access to a public place established by the state exclusively for public use. <br class=\"akn-br\"/><br class=\"akn-br\"/>Clause 3 discusses Special Provision for Women and Children.

The court also stated that the backwardness must be both Social and Economical. It can’t be either social or economical alone. <br class=\"akn-br\"/><br class=\"akn-br\"/>It was also held by the Supreme Court in<a class=\"akn-ref\" data-eid=\"part_III__sec_15__subsec_6__wrapup__p_2__ref_10\" data-href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/291633/\" href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/291633/\" id=\"part_III__sec_15__subsec_6__wrapup__p_2__ref_10\">A.

Union of India (2008)</a><br class=\"akn-br\"/><br class=\"akn-br\"/>Clause 6 lays down the Special Provisions for EWS category. This provision was added by the 103rd Constitutional amendment Act, 2019. This is the latest exception that provides for special provisions for the Economic Weaker Section (EWS). Several states have implemented schemes to enforce reservations for Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) based on Clause (6). In 2021, the central government issued a notification to introduce EWS reservation in the medical postgraduate entrance exam. However, this decision was challenged in the Supreme Court.Multiple parties raised concerns about the constitutionality of the 103rd Amendment and brought the matter before the Supreme Court. They argued that it goes against the jurisprudence on reservations, which does not permit reservations solely based on economic criteria.

However, some states have chosen to implement the 10% reservation for economically weaker sections. Currently, the quota can be availed by persons with an annual gross household income of up to ₹8 lakh (US$10,000). Families that own over 5 acres of agricultural land, a house over 1,000 square feet, a plot of over 100-yards in a notified municipal area or over a 200-yards plot in a non-notified municipal area cannot avail the reservation. Persons belonging to communities that already have reservations such as Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and the \"non creamy layer\" of Other Backward Classes are also not eligible for reservation under this quota(creamy layer of OBC crosses 8 lakh limit).<a class=\"akn-ref\" data-eid=\"part_III__sec_15__subsec_6__wrapup__p_3__ref_1\" data-href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Hundred_and_Third_Amendment_of_the_Constitution_of_India\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Hundred_and_Third_Amendment_of_the_Constitution_of_India\" id=\"part_III__sec_15__subsec_6__wrapup__p_3__ref_1\">Also Refer</a>]</span></span></span></section></section><section class=\"akn-section\" id=\"section_16\"><h3><a href=\"/doc/211089/\">16.</a> Equality of opportunity in matters of public employment</h3>\n<section class=\"akn-subsection\" id=\"section_16.1\"><span class=\"akn-num\"><a href=\"/doc/250697/\">(1)</a></span><span class=\"akn-content\"><span class=\"akn-p\">There shall be equality of opportunity for all citizens in matters relating to employment or appointment to any office under the State,</span></span></section><section class=\"akn-subsection\" id=\"section_16.2\"><span class=\"akn-num\"><a href=\"/doc/1011960/\">(2)</a></span><span class=\"akn-content\"><span class=\"akn-p\">No citizen shall, on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, descent, place of birth, residence or any of them, be ineligible for, or discriminated against in respect of, any employment or office under the State.</span></span></section><section class=\"akn-subsection\" id=\"section_16.3\"><span class=\"akn-num\"><a href=\"/doc/386518/\">(3)</a></span><span class=\"akn-content\"><span class=\"akn-p\">Nothing in this article shall prevent Parliament from making any law prescribing, in regard to a class or classes of employment or appointment to an officeunder the Government of, or any local or other authority within, a State or Union territory, any requirement as to residence within that State or Union territory prior to such employment or appointment.</span></span></section><section class=\"akn-subsection\" id=\"section_16.4\"><span class=\"akn-num\"><a href=\"/doc/68038/\">(4)</a></span><span class=\"akn-content\"><span class=\"akn-p\">Nothing in this article shall prevent the State from making any provision for the reservation of appointments or posts in favour of any backward class of citizens which, in the opinion of the State, is not adequately represented in the services under the State.</span></span></section><section class=\"akn-subsection\" id=\"section_16.4A\"><span class=\"akn-num\"><a href=\"/doc/137418340/\">(4A)</a></span><span class=\"akn-content\"><span class=\"akn-p\">Nothing in this article shall prevent the State from making any provision for reservation in matters of promotion, with consequential seniority, to any class or classes of posts in the services under the State in favour of Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes which in the opinion of State are not adequately represented in the services under the State.</span><span class=\"akn-p\"><span class=\"akn-remark\" data-status=\"editorial\">[In article 16 of the Constitution after clause 4, the following clauses shall be inserted through Constitution (Seventy-seventh Amendment) Act, 1995]</span></span><span class=\"akn-p\"><span class=\"akn-remark\" data-status=\"editorial\">[<b class=\"akn-b\">Editorial comment</b> -The Constitution (Seventy-seventh Amendment) Act, 1995, broadened the reservation provisions for job promotions, encompassing individuals belonging to Scheduled Castes and Tribes.

Further, it cannot extend to a reservation in matters of promotion. The interests of the SC and STs will be harmed by this Supreme Court decision. It is vital to continue the current dispensation of offering reservations in promotion for the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes since their representation in services in the States has not achieved the requisite level. The government has chosen to maintain the prevailing policy of reservations in the promotion of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes in light of its commitment to safeguarding the interests of these groups. To achieve this, it is necessary to change Article 16 of the Indian Constitution. This is accomplished by adding a new clause (4A) to the aforementioned article that establishes a reservation in promotion for the Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs).<a class=\"akn-ref\" data-eid=\"part_III__sec_16__subsec_4A__p_3__ref_2\" data-href=\"https://blog.examarly.com/upsc/77th-amendment-of-indian-constitution/\" href=\"https://blog.examarly.com/upsc/77th-amendment-of-indian-constitution/\" id=\"part_III__sec_16__subsec_4A__p_3__ref_2\">Also refer</a>]</span></span><span class=\"akn-p\"><span class=\"akn-remark\" data-status=\"editorial\">[<b class=\"akn-b\">Editorial comment</b> -The primary goal of the Constitution (Eighty-fifth Amendment) Act, 2002, was to increase the benefits of reservation in favor of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in matters of promotion, with consequential seniority, to any class.

This clause does not provide the right to employment; it only gives the right to equal opportunity in case of any available vacancy in public employment. This clause also applies to promotions or termination and other aspects of state employment. This equality is applied only to the people who are applying for the same employment opportunity or are working in the same post. <br class=\"akn-br\"/><br class=\"akn-br\"/>Clause 2 states that there will be no discrimination based on religion, race, caste, sex, descent, place of birth, residence in employment.

Devadashan v. Union of India, AIR 1964</a>, the court struck down the carry forward rule for the vacancies of backward classes. The Court held that, following Balaji, the reserve vacancies in any one year had risen to more than 50% because they were not constitutional because of the carry-forward clause. The 50% rule only applies to proper reservations, i.e., backward classes reservations made under Article 16(4).

Thus, the recommendation of reservations for OBCs in central government services was finally implemented in 1992. The Supreme Court states that 27% central government reservation for OBCs is valid. However, some states denied the existence of the creamy layer, and a report commissioned by the supreme court was implemented. The case was pressed again in 1999 and the supreme court reaffirmed the creamy layer exclusion and extended it to SCs and STs.

Furthermore, the Untouchability Offences Act of 1955 (renamed as the Protection of Civil Rights Act in 1976) considers the practice of untouchability as a criminal offense, and individuals engaging in such practices are subject to legal punishment. According to this Act, anything accessible to the general public should be equally accessible to all Indian citizens.​ Article 17 is a very important part of the Right to Equality. It not only provides equality but also social justice. Also the Schedule Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 ​led to the establishment of special courts to decide the cases related to the commission of offenses under this act.

However, military and academic distinctions are exceptions to this prohibition. This means that universities, for instance, can grant titles or honors to individuals based on their merit. Article 18(2) specifically prohibits Indian citizens from accepting titles from foreign states. Article 18(3) states that non-citizens holding positions of profit or trust under the Indian State require the President's consent to accept titles from foreign states. Additionally, Article 18(4) stipulates that no person, whether a citizen or a non-citizen, holding a position of profit or trust, can accept any gifts, salary, or office from a foreign state without the President's consent. Clauses (3) and (4) aim to ensure the loyalty of non-citizens towards the Indian State and prevent any breach of trust.<br class=\"akn-br\"/><br class=\"akn-br\"/>A \"title\" refers to an attachment to one's name, such as a prefix or suffix (e.g., Sir, Nawab, Maharaja). In a democracy, the creation of titles and titular glories is discouraged as it goes against the principles of social equality.<br class=\"akn-br\"/><br class=\"akn-br\"/>However, it is argued that titles like \"Bharat Ratna,\" \"Padma Vibhushan,\" and \"Padma Shri\" (introduced in 1954) are not prohibited under Article 18 because they signify state recognition of exceptional work by citizens in various fields. It is important to note that Article 18 does not confer any fundamental right but rather imposes restrictions on executive and legislative powers. The conferral of titles is seen as contrary to the fundamental principle of equality guaranteed by Article 14, which ensures equal treatment of all citizens.<br class=\"akn-br\"/><br class=\"akn-br\"/>In the landmark judgment <a class=\"akn-ref\" data-eid=\"part_III__sec_18__subsec_4__p_2__ref_1\" data-href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1882300/\" href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1882300/\" id=\"part_III__sec_18__subsec_4__p_2__ref_1\">Balaji Raghavan v. Union of India</a>, AIR 1996, the court held that National awards aren’t titles under clause 1 of Article 18. A committee (High Level Review Committee: chaired by the Vice-President) was set up by the Government in which it states that the awards should be given based on recommendations of names given by various state governments. These recommendations will be reviewed by the Centre government. After this committee, the names will be sent to the Prime Minister’s Office and finally sent to the President for the final verdict.

However it is the constitutional obligation of the judiciary to ensure that the restrictions imposed by a law on the media are reasonable and relate to the purposes specified in Article 19(2).Because reasonable restrictions contemplated under the Indian Constitution brings the matter in the domain of the court as the question of reasonableness is a question primarily for the Court to decide.

The extensive establishment of cooperatives was envisioned as one of the attempts to achieve social and economic justice and the equitable distribution of the advantages of progress. According to this Amendment, these societies are given constitutional status and are legally protected while also maintaining their autonomous or democratic functioning. The Constitution was amended to require that the states guarantee the autonomy of cooperatives, and as a result, state governments are now required to support the voluntary formation, autonomous decision-making, democratic control, and operation of cooperatives. The Act witnessed many changes such as modification in Part III of Article 19(1)(c) with the insertion of the words “or co-operative societies”, and the addition of Article 43B (working towards enhancing the co-Operative Societies’ Voluntary formation, independent operation, and professional management) and Part IX B to the Indian Constitution. However, the 97th Amendment faced challenges in the High Court of Gujarat as the Parliament didn’t ask for approval from the state legislatures before passing the bill. The ratification/approval is necessary for matters concerning states and since the cooperative societies are a part of the state legislature, ratification was required. On July 20, 2021, the Supreme Court of India declared the 97th Amendment Act Unconstitutional. According to the Supreme Court ratification from states was necessary to pass the amendment which didn’t take place. The Supreme Court also said that the responsibility of Multistate Co-Operative societies is of the Centre while that of the State co-operative societies is of the state.

It provides protection against self-incrimination, double jeopardy, and retrospective punishment. <br class=\"akn-br\"/><br class=\"akn-br\"/>Article 20(1) prohibits the imposition of retrospective punishment. It states that no person shall be punished for an act that was not an offense at the time it was committed. This provision ensures that individuals cannot be held accountable for actions that were legal when they occurred but were later made illegal by subsequent legislation.<br class=\"akn-br\"/><br class=\"akn-br\"/>In the landmark judgment, <a class=\"akn-ref\" data-eid=\"part_III__sec_20__subsec_3__p_2__ref_1\" data-href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/387616/\" href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/387616/\" id=\"part_III__sec_20__subsec_3__p_2__ref_1\">Kedar Nath v.

State of Rajasthan</a> involving the Narcotics, Drugs, and Psychotropic Substances Act, the court opined that Article 20 prohibits only conviction and punishment under an ex post facto law, not the trial or prosecution itself. Furthermore, a trial conducted under a different procedure from the one existing at the time of the offense does not fall within the scope of this provision and cannot be deemed unconstitutional.<br class=\"akn-br\"/><br class=\"akn-br\"/>In another significant judgment, <a class=\"akn-ref\" data-eid=\"part_III__sec_20__subsec_3__p_2__ref_3\" data-href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1222748/\" href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1222748/\" id=\"part_III__sec_20__subsec_3__p_2__ref_3\">Maru Ram Etc. v.

The State of Punjab</a>, the Supreme Court allowed for retrospective application of criminal laws in situations where the issue at hand concerns the reduction of punishment for the said offense.<br class=\"akn-br\"/><br class=\"akn-br\"/>Article 20(2) prohibits a person from being prosecuted and punished for the same offense more than once. This principle of double jeopardy prevents individuals from being subjected to multiple trials or punishments for the same offense. Once a person has been acquitted or convicted and punished for a particular offense, they cannot be tried or punished again for the same offense.<br class=\"akn-br\"/><br class=\"akn-br\"/>In the case of <a class=\"akn-ref\" data-eid=\"part_III__sec_20__subsec_3__p_2__ref_5\" data-href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1640660/\" href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1640660/\" id=\"part_III__sec_20__subsec_3__p_2__ref_5\">Venkataraman v.

And, later when the person was prosecuted before a criminal court, the court was confronted with the question whether this amounts to Double Jeopardy.<br class=\"akn-br\"/><br class=\"akn-br\"/>But, the Supreme Court observed that departmental proceedings, i.e. by Customs Authority, in this case, doesn’t amount to trial by a judicial tribunal, thus the proceedings before the criminal court is not barred in this case and the proceedings can go on. In a nutshell Departmental Proceedings are independent of trial by a judicial court or tribunal.<br class=\"akn-br\"/><br class=\"akn-br\"/>However, the prosecution may happen if the facts are distinct in subsequent proceedings.

Mulla v. State of Maharashtra</a> and was observed that; Article 20 (2) would not be attracted in those cases where the facts are distinct in subsequent offence or punishment.<br class=\"akn-br\"/><br class=\"akn-br\"/>Article 20(3) ensures that no person accused of an offense shall be compelled to be a witness against themselves. This means that an individual cannot be forced to provide evidence or testimony that may incriminate themselves. It is a fundamental right that protects individuals from being compelled to be witnesses in their own criminal prosecution.<br class=\"akn-br\"/><br class=\"akn-br\"/>Prohibition against self-incrimination could only be put into effect if the person is accused of a criminal offence. This doctrine could not be invoked for cases other than criminal cases. Also, as held by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in <a class=\"akn-ref\" data-eid=\"part_III__sec_20__subsec_3__p_2__ref_8\" data-href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/693505/\" href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/693505/\" id=\"part_III__sec_20__subsec_3__p_2__ref_8\">Raja Narayanlal Bansilal vs Maneck Phiroz Mistry</a>, to claim the immunity from being self-incriminated, there must exist a formal accusation against the person and mere general inquiry and investigation don’t form grounds for the same.<br class=\"akn-br\"/><br class=\"akn-br\"/>These safeguards provided under Article 20 are essential components of a fair and just legal system. They uphold the principles of fairness, protection against self-incrimination, and the prevention of arbitrary or excessive punishment. It's important to note that these protections are applicable in criminal proceedings and serve as a shield against certain violations of individual rights. However, reasonable restrictions and limitations can be imposed in the interests of public order, security of the State, or the proper administration of justice.</span></span><span class=\"akn-p\">References</span><span class=\"akn-p\"><a class=\"akn-ref\" data-eid=\"part_III__sec_20__subsec_3__p_4__ref_1\" data-href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/655638/\" href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/655638/\" id=\"part_III__sec_20__subsec_3__p_4__ref_1\">IndianKanoon</a></span><span class=\"akn-p\"><a class=\"akn-ref\" data-eid=\"part_III__sec_20__subsec_3__p_5__ref_1\" data-href=\"https://blog.ipleaders.in/article-20/\" href=\"https://blog.ipleaders.in/article-20/\" id=\"part_III__sec_20__subsec_3__p_5__ref_1\">Blog Ipleaders</a></span><span class=\"akn-p\"><a class=\"akn-ref\" data-eid=\"part_III__sec_20__subsec_3__p_6__ref_1\" data-href=\"https://lawctopus.com/clatalogue/clat-pg/article-20-under-the-indian-constitution/\" href=\"https://lawctopus.com/clatalogue/clat-pg/article-20-under-the-indian-constitution/\" id=\"part_III__sec_20__subsec_3__p_6__ref_1\">Lawctopus</a></span><span class=\"akn-p\"><a class=\"akn-ref\" data-eid=\"part_III__sec_20__subsec_3__p_7__ref_1\" data-href=\"https://constitutionofindia.net/articles/article-20-protection-in-respect-of-conviction-for-offences/\" href=\"https://constitutionofindia.net/articles/article-20-protection-in-respect-of-conviction-for-offences/\" id=\"part_III__sec_20__subsec_3__p_7__ref_1\">ConstitutionofIndia.net</a></span></span></section></section><section class=\"akn-section\" id=\"section_21\"><h3><a href=\"/doc/1199182/\">21.</a> Protection of life and personal liberty</h3>\n<span class=\"akn-content\"><span class=\"akn-p\">No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law.</span><span class=\"akn-p\"><span class=\"akn-remark\" data-status=\"editorial\"><b class=\"akn-b\">Editorial Comment</b> - Article 21 of the Indian Constitution guarantees the fundamental right to protection of life and personal liberty.

Article 21 also protects the personal liberty of individuals. It states that no person shall be deprived of their personal liberty except according to the procedure established by law.

Roy v. Union of India (AIR 1982)</a> (NSA case), the Supreme Court discussed whether the provisions of Natural Justice should be applied to the National Security act or not. This Act took away many important rights of a detained person like Right to be represented by a lawyer, Right to cross-examine the detaining authority etc. The court held that Natural justice is important but it cannot be applied in all the acts. It is important to look at the circumstances and the purpose of making the Act. So based on this logic the court upheld the NSA Act (1980).<br class=\"akn-br\"/><br class=\"akn-br\"/>The interpretation and scope of Article 21 have evolved through various landmark judgments of the Supreme Court, expanding its ambit to include protection against torture, custodial violence, and the right to a clean and healthy environment. It's important to note that reasonable restrictions can be imposed on the rights guaranteed under Article 21 in the interests of public order, national security, public health, or morality. However, such restrictions must be fair, just, and in accordance with the principles of reasonableness and proportionality.</span></span><span class=\"akn-p\">References</span><span class=\"akn-p\"><a class=\"akn-ref\" data-eid=\"part_III__sec_21__p_4__ref_1\" data-href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1199182/\" href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1199182/\" id=\"part_III__sec_21__p_4__ref_1\">IndianKanoon</a> </span><span class=\"akn-p\"><a class=\"akn-ref\" data-eid=\"part_III__sec_21__p_5__ref_1\" data-href=\"https://legalserviceindia.com/articles/art222.htm\" href=\"https://legalserviceindia.com/articles/art222.htm\" id=\"part_III__sec_21__p_5__ref_1\">Legal Service India</a> </span><span class=\"akn-p\"><a class=\"akn-ref\" data-eid=\"part_III__sec_21__p_6__ref_1\" data-href=\"https://lawctopus.com/academike/article-21-of-the-constitution-of-india-right-to-life-and-personal-liberty/\" href=\"https://lawctopus.com/academike/article-21-of-the-constitution-of-india-right-to-life-and-personal-liberty/\" id=\"part_III__sec_21__p_6__ref_1\">Lawctopus Academike</a> </span><span class=\"akn-p\"><a class=\"akn-ref\" data-eid=\"part_III__sec_21__p_7__ref_1\" data-href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_rights_in_India\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_rights_in_India\" id=\"part_III__sec_21__p_7__ref_1\">Wikipedia</a></span></span></section><section class=\"akn-section\" id=\"section_21A\"><h3><a href=\"/doc/154644006/\">21A.</a> Right to education</h3>\n<span class=\"akn-content\"><span class=\"akn-p\">The State shall provide free and compulsory education to all children of the age of six to fourteen years in such manner as the State may, by law, determine.</span><span class=\"akn-p\"><span class=\"akn-remark\" data-status=\"editorial\"><b class=\"akn-b\">Editorial Comment</b>- Article 21A of the Indian Constitution guarantees the right to education as a fundamental right for children between the ages of 6 and 14 years.

Director of Public Instruction</a>, the publisher of a book had applied for the writ of mandamus against the Director of Public Instruction for the inclusion of his book in the list of books which were approved as text-books in schools. But the writ was not allowed as the matter was completely within the discretion of D.I.P and he was not bound to approve the book.<br class=\"akn-br\"/><br class=\"akn-br\"/>In the case of <a class=\"akn-ref\" data-eid=\"part_III__sec_32__subsec_4__p_2__ref_9\" data-href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/261493/\" href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/261493/\" id=\"part_III__sec_32__subsec_4__p_2__ref_9\">Binny Ltd. &amp; Anr v. V. Sadasivan &amp; Ors</a> (2005), the Supreme Court laid down the scope of mandamus. It stated that a writ of mandamus is not applicable against any private wrong.

India (1975)</a> the Delhi High Court refused to issue a prohibition against the Central Government from engaging in a boundary dispute agreement with Sri Lanka. The judgment was founded on the basis that there is no bar against the government performing executive or administrative duties. With the idea of natural justice and the growth of the concept of fairness, there is no longer a tolerable view, even in administrative tasks. If any of the grounds on which the writ of prohibition is issued is present, the writ can now be issued to anybody, regardless of the nature of the duty fulfilled by it. Prohibition is currently considered as a broad remedy for judicial control of impacting quasi-judicial as well as administrative actions.<br class=\"akn-br\"/><br class=\"akn-br\"/>In the case, <a class=\"akn-ref\" data-eid=\"part_III__sec_32__subsec_4__p_2__ref_12\" data-href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1345052/\" href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1345052/\" id=\"part_III__sec_32__subsec_4__p_2__ref_12\">S. Govind Menon v. Union of India (1967)</a> a Writ of prohibition was issued by a higher court, namely the Kerala High Court, to a lower court in order to take over jurisdiction that was not initially vested, or in other words, to compel lower courts to retain their jurisdictional limitations. The writ can be issued when there is an excess of jurisdiction as well as when there is an absence of jurisdiction.<br class=\"akn-br\"/><br class=\"akn-br\"/>In the case, <a class=\"akn-ref\" data-eid=\"part_III__sec_32__subsec_4__p_2__ref_13\" data-href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1450722/\" href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1450722/\" id=\"part_III__sec_32__subsec_4__p_2__ref_13\">Hari Vishnu v. Syed Ahmed Ishaque (1955)</a> dealt with distinctions between writs of prohibition and certiorari. The verdict, in this case, distinguished between certiorari and prohibition writs and said that when the lower court issues a decision, the petitioner must file a certiorari petition since prohibition writs can only be submitted when judgment has not yet been given.<br class=\"akn-br\"/><br class=\"akn-br\"/>In this case, <a class=\"akn-ref\" data-eid=\"part_III__sec_32__subsec_4__p_2__ref_14\" data-href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/71164970/\" href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/71164970/\" id=\"part_III__sec_32__subsec_4__p_2__ref_14\">Prudential Capital Markets Ltd v. The State of A.P. and others,</a> (2000) it was questionable whether the prohibition writ could be issued against the district forum/state commission which had already passed judgments in the depositors’ consumer cases. The Court held that after the execution of the order, the writ of prohibition cannot be issued, the judgment can neither be prevented nor stopped.<br class=\"akn-br\"/><br class=\"akn-br\"/><b class=\"akn-b\">Certiorari</b>: To quash an order passed by a lower court, tribunal, or authority.<br class=\"akn-br\"/><br class=\"akn-br\"/>In <a class=\"akn-ref\" data-eid=\"part_III__sec_32__subsec_4__p_2__ref_15\" data-href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1016548/\" href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1016548/\" id=\"part_III__sec_32__subsec_4__p_2__ref_15\">Surya Dev Rai v. Ram Chander Rai &amp; Ors.,</a> the Supreme Court has explained the meaning, ambit and scope of the writ of Certiorari. Also, in this it was explained that Certiorari is always available against inferior courts and not against equal or higher courts, i.e., it cannot be issued by a High Court against any High Court or benches much less to the Supreme Court and any of its benches.<br class=\"akn-br\"/><br class=\"akn-br\"/>Then in the case of <a class=\"akn-ref\" data-eid=\"part_III__sec_32__subsec_4__p_2__ref_16\" data-href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1959866/\" href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1959866/\" id=\"part_III__sec_32__subsec_4__p_2__ref_16\">T.C.

Ahmad Ishaque</a> the Supreme Court said that “the court issuing certiorari to quash, however, could not substitute its own decision on the merits or give directions to be complied with by the court or tribunal. Its work was destructive, it simply wiped out the order passed without jurisdiction, and left the matter there.” In <a class=\"akn-ref\" data-eid=\"part_III__sec_32__subsec_4__p_2__ref_18\" data-href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1643138/\" href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1643138/\" id=\"part_III__sec_32__subsec_4__p_2__ref_18\">Naresh S.

Karkare v. T.L. Shevde, the High Court of Nagpur observed that “In proceedings for a writ of quo-warranto, the applicant does not seek to enforce any right of his as such nor does he complain of any non-performance of duty towards him. What is in question is the right of the non-applicant to hold the office and an order that is passed is an order ousting him from that office.”<br class=\"akn-br\"/><br class=\"akn-br\"/>In the case of <a class=\"akn-ref\" data-eid=\"part_III__sec_32__subsec_4__p_2__ref_19\" data-href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/70296101/\" href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/70296101/\" id=\"part_III__sec_32__subsec_4__p_2__ref_19\">Bharati Reddy v. The State Of Karnataka (2018)</a>, the Hon’ble Supreme Court held that a writ of quo warranto cannot be issued based on assumptions, inferences, or speculations concerning the fact of accomplishment of qualifying conditions. There must be an establishment of the fact that a public officer is abusing lawful powers not vested to him within the public authority. <br class=\"akn-br\"/><br class=\"akn-br\"/>Direct Access to Supreme Court: Unlike Article 226, which pertains to the High Courts and enables individuals to seek writs for enforcement of their fundamental rights, Article 32 provides a direct avenue to the Supreme Court for this purpose.<br class=\"akn-br\"/><br class=\"akn-br\"/>Suspension During Emergency: During a proclamation of Emergency, the right to move the Supreme Court under Article 32 can be suspended.

Article 370 was incorporated into the Constitution of India as a temporary provision, with the intention of providing a framework for negotiations between the Indian government and the leadership of Jammu and Kashmir to determine the state's final political status. This was done through the instrument of a Presidential Order in 1954, which extended various provisions of the Indian Constitution to Jammu and Kashmir, subject to certain modifications. Article 370 was incorporated into the Constitution of India as a temporary provision, with the intention of providing a framework for negotiations between the Indian government and the leadership of Jammu and Kashmir to determine the state's final political status.  This was done through the instrument of a Presidential Order in 1954, which extended various provisions of the Indian Constitution to Jammu and Kashmir, subject to certain modifications. Article 370 and Article 35A were closely linked in terms of their impact on the constitutional and legal status of Jammu and Kashmir. Article 370 was the constitutional provision that granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir, while Article 35A was a legal provision that flowed from Article 370 and gave the state of Jammu and Kashmir the power to define who is a \"permanent resident\" of the state, and to confer special rights and privileges to these residents. Article 35A was added to the Indian Constitution through a Presidential Order in 1954, which was issued under the authority of Article 370. The provision allowed the Jammu and Kashmir state legislature to define permanent residents of the state and provide them with special rights and privileges, such as the right to own property, access to government jobs, and scholarships. The provision also prohibited non-permanent residents from acquiring any of these rights or privileges. In April 2018, the Supreme Court of India ruled that Article 370 had attained permanency since the state constituent assembly has ceased to exist. To overcome this legal challenge, the Indian government instead rendered Article 370 as 'Inoperative' even though it still exists in the constitution. On 5 August, issued a <a class=\"akn-ref\" data-eid=\"part_III__sec_35A__wrapup__p_1__ref_1\" data-href=\"https://egazette.nic.in/WriteReadData/2019/210049.pdf\" href=\"https://egazette.nic.in/WriteReadData/2019/210049.pdf\" id=\"part_III__sec_35A__wrapup__p_1__ref_1\">Presidential Order C.O. 272</a>; the Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 2019 which superseded the Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1954. This in effect meant that the separate Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir stood inoperative, and a single constitution now applied to all the Indian states.  The order was issued using the third clause of Article 370, which authorized the President of India to declare the article inoperative with exceptions and modifications, if recommended by the (non-existent) state constituent assembly to do so. To circumvent the legal issue of the non-existent state constituent assembly, the President used the Clause (1) of Article 370, which conferred him with the power to modify the Indian Constitution on subjects related to Jammu and Kashmir. So he first added a new clause to Article 367, which deals with interpretation of the Constitution. He replaced the phrase 'Constituent Assembly of the State' with 'Legislative Assembly of the State'. Since the state legislative assembly has been suspended, the order says that any reference to the legislative assembly will be construed as a reference to the Governor of Jammu and Kashmir. The governor is an appointee of the Central government.

Before this, members of both Houses of Parliament were required to assemble to elect the Vice-President. This means that the Vice-President can now be chosen by the members of this electoral college, and it is no longer necessary for them to assemble in one place to carry out the election process. However, with this change, a new electoral college was created, which comprises members from both Houses of Parliament is a crucial step towards democratization and inclusivity in the Indian political system. It adds a new clause (4) to Article 71 of the Constitution. By eliminating the requirement for members of both Houses of Parliament to physically meet together to elect the Vice-President, the amendment made the process more efficient and streamlined. <a class=\"akn-ref\" data-eid=\"part_V__hcontainer_1__p_10__ref_1\" data-href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleventh_Amendment_of_the_Constitution_of_India\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleventh_Amendment_of_the_Constitution_of_India\" id=\"part_V__hcontainer_1__p_10__ref_1\">Also refer</a> ]</span></span><span class=\"akn-p\"><span class=\"akn-remark\" data-status=\"editorial\">[<b class=\"akn-b\">Editorial comment</b>-The Constitution (Forty-Fourth Amendment) Act, 1978, repealed Article 19 (1) (f) and also took out Article 31(1) has been taken out of Part III and made a separate Article 300A in Chapter IV of Part XII.

It altered the provisions of Articles 101, where it laid down the grounds of defection for members of either house of Parliament or state assemblies or councils. It aims to prevent political defections for reasons of office and other considerations from causing harm to democracy. Its proposed solution is to bar Members of Parliament and State Legislatures who deviate from party politics from continuing to hold their political office. This was not passed without a major change in the country’s political landscape. Nevertheless, it is the highest-level document drafted by our democracy and has the potential to make Indian politics more transparent. Aside from enhancing political freedoms, this amendment also contains provisions to curb corruption. The constitution’s anti-defection provisions were a result of a series of debates over the issue.<a class=\"akn-ref\" data-eid=\"part_V__sec_101__subsec_4__p_4__ref_1\" data-href=\"https://blog.examarly.com/upsc/52nd-amendment-of-indian-constitution/\" href=\"https://blog.examarly.com/upsc/52nd-amendment-of-indian-constitution/\" id=\"part_V__sec_101__subsec_4__p_4__ref_1\">Also Refer</a>]</span></span></span></section></section><section class=\"akn-section\" id=\"section_102\"><h3><a href=\"/doc/390434/\">102.</a> Disqualifications for membership</h3>\n<section class=\"akn-subsection\" id=\"section_102.1\"><span class=\"akn-num\"><a href=\"/doc/964829/\">(1)</a></span><span class=\"akn-intro\"><span class=\"akn-p\">A person shall be disqualified for being chosen as, and for being, a member of either House of Parliament--</span></span><section class=\"akn-paragraph\" id=\"section_102.1.a\"><span class=\"akn-num\"><a href=\"/doc/785164/\">(a)</a></span><span class=\"akn-content\"><span class=\"akn-p\">if he holds any office of profit under the Government of India or the Government of any State, other than an office declared by Parliament by law not to disqualify its holder;</span></span></section><section class=\"akn-paragraph\" id=\"section_102.1.b\"><span class=\"akn-num\"><a href=\"/doc/206982/\">(b)</a></span><span class=\"akn-content\"><span class=\"akn-p\">if he is of unsound mind and stands so declared by a competent court;</span></span></section><section class=\"akn-paragraph\" id=\"section_102.1.c\"><span class=\"akn-num\"><a href=\"/doc/1176537/\">(c)</a></span><span class=\"akn-content\"><span class=\"akn-p\">if he is an undischarged insolvent;</span></span></section><section class=\"akn-paragraph\" id=\"section_102.1.d\"><span class=\"akn-num\"><a href=\"/doc/1917907/\">(d)</a></span><span class=\"akn-content\"><span class=\"akn-p\">if he is not a citizen of India, or has voluntarily acquired the citizenship of a foreign State, or is under any acknowledgement of allegiance or adherence to a foreign State;</span></span></section><section class=\"akn-paragraph\" id=\"section_102.1.e\"><span class=\"akn-num\"><a href=\"/doc/84427/\">(e)</a></span><span class=\"akn-content\"><span class=\"akn-p\">if he is so disqualified by or under any law made by Parliament.</span></span></section><span class=\"akn-wrapUp\"><span class=\"akn-p\">Explanation.-- For the purposes of this clause a person shall not be deemed to hold an office of profit under the Government of India or the Government of any State by reason only that he is a Minister either for the Union or for such State.</span></span></section><section class=\"akn-subsection\" id=\"section_102.2\"><span class=\"akn-num\"><a href=\"/doc/1987723/\">(2)</a></span><span class=\"akn-content\"><span class=\"akn-p\">A person shall be disqualified for being a member of either House of Parliament if he is so disqualified under the Tenth Schedule.</span></span></section></section><section class=\"akn-section\" id=\"section_103\"><h3><a href=\"/doc/41049/\">103.</a> Decision on questions as to disqualifications of members</h3>\n<section class=\"akn-subsection\" id=\"section_103.1\"><span class=\"akn-num\"><a href=\"/doc/834320/\">(1)</a></span><span class=\"akn-content\"><span class=\"akn-p\">If any question arises as to whether a member of either House of Parliament has become subject to any of the disqualifications mentioned in clause (1) of article 102, the question shall be referred for the decision of the President and his decision shall be final.</span></span></section><section class=\"akn-subsection\" id=\"section_103.2\"><span class=\"akn-num\"><a href=\"/doc/1042703/\">(2)</a></span><span class=\"akn-content\"><span class=\"akn-p\">Before giving any decision on any such question, the President shall obtain the opinion of the Election Commission and shall act according to such opinion.</span><span class=\"akn-p\"><span class=\"akn-remark\" data-status=\"editorial\">[<b class=\"akn-b\">Editorial comment</b>-The Constitution (Forty-Fourth Amendment) Act, 1978, repealed Article 19 (1) (f) and also took out Article 31(1) has been taken out of Part III and made a separate Article 300A in Chapter IV of Part XII.

A 7-judge Constitution bench has held that unfettered re-promulgation of ordinances is not permissible by the Constitution. On 2nd January, 2017, a seven-judge Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court held that re-promulgation of ordinances is a fraud on the Constitution and a subversion of democratic legislative processes. The majority Judgment, authored by Justice DY Chandrachud, held that the requirement of placing the ordinance before the Legislature is mandatory; Justice Madan B Lokur observed that it is directory; Justice Thakur, the Chief Justice of India as he was then, in his separate concurring opinion, preferred to leave the ‘question of interpretation of Articles 123 (2) and 213(2) in so far as the obligation of the Government to place the ordinance before the Parliament/legislature open. The Supreme Court of India’s seven-judge Constitution Bench ruled that the “RE-PROMULGATION OF ORDINANCES” must be taken to be a violation of our Indian Constitution as it undermines parliamentary legislative procedures. This Bench furthermore ruled that: “The approval and gratification of the President of India, under Article 123, and the Governor, under Article 213, when issuing an Ordinance is not excluded from judicial process and legal challenge.”(https:<i class=\"akn-i\">indiankanoon.org/doc/107225908/, https:</i>blog.ipleaders.in unconstitutionality-of-the-re-promulgation-of-ordinances-the-krishna-kumar-singh-conundrum/)]</span></span><span class=\"akn-p\"><span class=\"akn-remark\" data-status=\"editorial\">[<b class=\"akn-b\">Editorial comment</b>-The Constitution (Forty-Fourth Amendment) Act, 1978, repealed Article 19 (1) (f) and also took out Article 31(1) has been taken out of Part III and made a separate Article 300A in Chapter IV of Part XII.

A 7-judge Constitution bench has held that unfettered re-promulgation of ordinances is not permissible by the Constitution. On 2nd January, 2017, a seven-judge Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court held that re-promulgation of ordinances is a fraud on the Constitution and a subversion of democratic legislative processes. The majority Judgment, authored by Justice DY Chandrachud, held that the requirement of placing the ordinance before the Legislature is mandatory; Justice Madan B Lokur observed that it is directory; Justice Thakur, the Chief Justice of India as he was then, in his separate concurring opinion, preferred to leave the ‘question of interpretation of Articles 123 (2) and 213(2) in so far as the obligation of the Government to place the ordinance before the Parliament/legislature open. The Supreme Court of India’s seven-judge Constitution Bench ruled that the “RE-PROMULGATION OF ORDINANCES” must be taken to be a violation of our Indian Constitution as it undermines parliamentary legislative procedures. This Bench furthermore ruled that: “The approval and gratification of the President of India, under Article 123, and the Governor, under Article 213, when issuing an Ordinance is not excluded from judicial process and legal challenge.”(https:<i class=\"akn-i\">indiankanoon.org/doc/107225908/, https:</i>blog.ipleaders.in unconstitutionality-of-the-re-promulgation-of-ordinances-the-krishna-kumar-singh-conundrum/)]</span></span><span class=\"akn-p\"><span class=\"akn-remark\" data-status=\"editorial\">[<b class=\"akn-b\">Editorial comment</b>-The Constitution (Thirty-Eighth Amendment) Act, 1975, codified the declaration of Emergency and empowered the State to remove fundamental rights during a state of emergency.

(Seventy-third Amendment) Act, 1992, was a significant reform in the Constitution of India. It introduced the concept of gram panchayats, which is a third-level government that deals directly with the public and works to address problems at the grass-roots level. Article 243 (b) defines the gram sabha, which consists of persons registered on the electoral rolls. It is the basic unit of the Panchayati Raj Institution. This institution is empowered to perform various functions at the village level, including establishing schools and health facilities. This act granted constitutional status to panchayats and democratized decentralization. It also empowered panchayats at all levels to levy taxes and collect duties. It further ensures that people at the grassroots level are more engaged in the governance process. It focused on improving rural political structures and the rights of vulnerable populations. The Act emphasized the need for women to be a part of local government structures. This law made it simpler for women to get involved in politics by giving them greater possibilities. The act also made women eligible to serve as Panchayat members. This amendment Act of Indian Constitution also made provisions for reserving seats for SC/ST/OBC communities and women in the legislature. In addition, it removed the upper population limit in parliamentary constituencies.<a class=\"akn-ref\" data-eid=\"part_IX__sec_243__wrapup__p_1__ref_1\"

(Seventy-fourth Amendment) Act, 1992, dealt with the devolution of power into the systems of Municipalities or Urban Local Governments. It mandated the setting up and devolution of powers to Urban local bodies (ULBs) or city governments as the lowest unit of governance in cities and towns. This landmark initiative of the Government of India was built upon the premise that all ‘power’ in a democracy rightfully belongs to ‘the people’. Power was mandated to be given to the people via the local bodies (referred to as municipalities), namely Municipal Corporations, Councils and Nagar Panchayats, which would have representatives that are elected regularly and have a decisive role in planning, provision and delivery of services. This Act prescribes institutional changes as well, with the setting up of Ward Committees, District Planning Committees and Metropolitan Planning Committees to coordinate planning across jurisdictions, as well as the setting up of State Election Commissions and State Financial Commissions. Effectively, this act gives ULBs a role much larger than just that of service providers that provide water, waste management, electricity, and so on.<a class=\"akn-ref\"

Article 334 had stipulated that the reservation of seats should expire within a period of ten years from the commencement of the Constitution (i.e. 26 January 1960).

A community for which the State in India may give “special provisions” or equality is classified as SEBCs, which contains the categories generally referred to as Other Backward Classes (OBCs). The Supreme Court ruled that the separate State lists were exempt from the authority and obligations of the National Commission for Backward Classes. State governments’ ability to create the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) list was reinstated by the 105th Amendment of Indian constitution. It said that States are exempt from the National Commission’s requirement for consultation. Consequently, over one-fifth of all OBC communities benefitted from this. It reinstated a Supreme Court literal interpretation that took away the States’ ability to keep a state list of OBCs. States were granted the power to react swiftly to socioeconomic needs that are unique to a state or region. India already had a federal structure, and the Bill that was passed strengthened it much more.<a class=\"akn-ref\" data-eid=\"part_XVI__sec_338B__subsec_9__p_5__ref_1\"

But states cannot declare a new caste. All they can do is recommend it. This means that the state government cannot declare a new caste as a BC (Backward Class).The 102 amendment of the Indian constitution (i.e. 102 caa) seeks to give the National Commission for Backward Classes a constitutional status, making it a quasi-independent body that examines welfare measures and complaints for socially and educationally backward classes.

Court's earlier decision which had upheld Parliament's power to amend all parts of the Constitution, including Part III related to Fundamental Rights. It amended Article 368 to provide expressly that Parliament has power to amend any provision of the Constitution. The amendment further made it obligatory for the President to give his assent, when a Constitution Amendment Bill was presented to him. The government has argued that the 24th Amendment will help to implement the Directive Principles of State Policy. However, a large section of constitutional experts would believe that the undisputed authority of Parliament is a threat to the democratic process in the country. In the Indian Constitution, the balance of legislative power is vital, and the power of amendment conferred to parliament to alter such regulations is often considered an important one. <a class=\"akn-ref\" data-eid=\"part_XX__sec_368__subsec_5__p_2__ref_1\" data-href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/257876/\" href=\"https://indiankanoon.org/doc/257876/\" id=\"part_XX__sec_368__subsec_5__p_2__ref_1\">Important Verdict-Kesavananda Bharati v.

Article 370 was incorporated into the Constitution of India as a temporary provision, with the intention of providing a framework for negotiations between the Indian government and the leadership of Jammu and Kashmir to determine the state's final political status. This was done through the instrument of a Presidential Order in 1954, which extended various provisions of the Indian Constitution to Jammu and Kashmir, subject to certain modifications. Article 370 was incorporated into the Constitution of India as a temporary provision, with the intention of providing a framework for negotiations between the Indian government and the leadership of Jammu and Kashmir to determine the state's final political status.  This was done through the instrument of a Presidential Order in 1954, which extended various provisions of the Indian Constitution to Jammu and Kashmir, subject to certain modifications. Article 370 and Article 35A were closely linked in terms of their impact on the constitutional and legal status of Jammu and Kashmir. Article 370 was the constitutional provision that granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir, while Article 35A was a legal provision that flowed from Article 370 and gave the state of Jammu and Kashmir the power to define who is a \"permanent resident\" of the state, and to confer special rights and privileges to these residents. Article 35A was added to the Indian Constitution through a Presidential Order in 1954, which was issued under the authority of Article 370. The provision allowed the Jammu and Kashmir state legislature to define permanent residents of the state and provide them with special rights and privileges, such as the right to own property, access to government jobs, and scholarships. The provision also prohibited non-permanent residents from acquiring any of these rights or privileges. In April 2018, the Supreme Court of India ruled that Article 370 had attained permanency since the state constituent assembly has ceased to exist. To overcome this legal challenge, the Indian government instead rendered Article 370 as 'Inoperative' even though it still exists in the constitution. On 5 August, issued a <a class=\"akn-ref\" data-eid=\"part_XXI__sec_370__subsec_3__p_3__ref_1\" data-href=\"https://egazette.nic.in/WriteReadData/2019/210049.pdf\" href=\"https://egazette.nic.in/WriteReadData/2019/210049.pdf\" id=\"part_XXI__sec_370__subsec_3__p_3__ref_1\">Presidential Order C.O. 272</a>; the Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 2019 which superseded the Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1954. This in effect meant that the separate Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir stood inoperative, and a single constitution now applied to all the Indian states.  The order was issued using the third clause of Article 370, which authorized the President of India to declare the article inoperative with exceptions and modifications, if recommended by the (non-existent) state constituent assembly to do so. To circumvent the legal issue of the non-existent state constituent assembly, the President used the Clause (1) of Article 370, which conferred him with the power to modify the Indian Constitution on subjects related to Jammu and Kashmir. So he first added a new clause to Article 367, which deals with interpretation of the Constitution. He replaced the phrase 'Constituent Assembly of the State' with 'Legislative Assembly of the State'. Since the state legislative assembly has been suspended, the order says that any reference to the legislative assembly will be construed as a reference to the Governor of Jammu and Kashmir. The governor is an appointee of the Central government. Therefore, the Indian Parliament now functions for the state legislative assembly.]</span></span></span></section></section><section class=\"akn-section\" id=\"section_371\"><h3><a href=\"/doc/89891/\">371.</a> Special provision with respect to the States of Maharashtra and Gujarat</h3>\n<section class=\"akn-subsection\" id=\"section_371.2\"><span class=\"akn-num\"><a href=\"/doc/1730233/\">(2)</a></span><span class=\"akn-intro\"><span class=\"akn-p\">Notwithstanding anything in this Constitution, the President may by order made with respect tothe State of Maharashtra or Gujarat, provide for any special responsibility of the Governor for-</span></span><section class=\"akn-paragraph\" id=\"section_371.2.a\"><span class=\"akn-num\"><a href=\"/doc/1381927/\">(a)</a></span><span class=\"akn-content\"><span class=\"akn-p\">the establishment of separate development boards for Vidarbha, Marathwada,and the rest of Maharashtra or, as the case may be, Saurashtra, Kutch and the rest of Gujarat with the provision that a report on the working of each of rest of these boards will be placed each year before the State Legislative Assembly;</span></span></section><section class=\"akn-paragraph\" id=\"section_371.2.b\"><span class=\"akn-num\"><a href=\"/doc/1648141/\">(b)</a></span><span class=\"akn-content\"><span class=\"akn-p\">the equitable allocation of funds for developmental expenditure over the said areas, subject to the requirements of the State as a whole; and</span></span></section><section class=\"akn-paragraph\" id=\"section_371.2.c\"><span class=\"akn-num\"><a href=\"/doc/1833503/\">(c)</a></span><span class=\"akn-content\"><span class=\"akn-p\">an equitable arrangement providing adequate facilities for technical education and vocational training, and adequate opportunities for employment in service under the control of the State Government, in respect of all the said areas, subject to the requirements of the State as a whole.</span></span></section><span class=\"akn-wrapUp\"><span class=\"akn-p\"><span class=\"akn-remark\" data-status=\"editorial\">[<b class=\"akn-b\">Editorial comment</b>- The Constitution (Seventh Amendment) Act, 1956, this Article was replaced with a new one that applies to the states of Andhra Pradesh, Punjab, and Bombay.

The only way to establish peace and harmony in the state was to sign a peace accord with the Mizo National Front (MNF). This treaty was finalized on June 30, 1986, and resulted in the insertion of Article 371G into the Indian Constitution through The Constitution (Fifty-Third Amendment), 1986.

As stipulated in the Indo-Pakistan Agreement of 1958, the amendment made it easier for India to cede the land of the Berubari Union to Pakistan. However, the West Bengal government did not agree to this agreement. Subsequently, the matter was taken to the Supreme Court, which declared that the transfer of Indian territory to a foreign country is not within Parliament’s authority to reduce a state’s area, as outlined in Article 3 of the Indian Constitution. It helped to resolve the conflicts by redrawing the boundaries and adjusting the territorial claims of each state.

It is the Constitution of India’s One Hundred and Twenty-Second Amendment Bill. GST is a Value Added Tax (VAT) proposed at the national level to be a comprehensive indirect tax levy on the manufacture, sale, and consumption of goods and services. It would replace all indirect taxes levied by the Indian Central and state governments on goods and services. It is intended to be comprehensive for the majority of goods and services. In the past, a person was required to pay a significant amount of taxes, including Central Excise Duty, Additional Excise Duty, Service Tax, Additional Customs Duty, State VAT, Entertainment Tax, and Entry Tax. The calculation of tax was significantly simplified with the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax. The Constitution Amendment Bill 122, often known as the 101 Amendment to the Indian Constitution, advocated for the implementation of GST. To prevent tax escalation and establish a single market for goods and services, the goods and services tax will replace numerous indirect taxes levied by the federal and state governments.<a class=\"akn-ref\" data-eid=\"att_7__sec_1__subsec_84__wrapup__p_1__ref_1\" data-href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Hundred_and_First_Amendment_to_the_Constitution_of_India\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Hundred_and_First_Amendment_to_the_Constitution_of_India\" id=\"att_7__sec_1__subsec_84__wrapup__p_1__ref_1\">Also Refer</a>]</span></span></span></section><section class=\"akn-subsection\"><span class=\"akn-num\">(85)</span><span class=\"akn-content\"><span class=\"akn-p\">Corporation tax.</span></span></section><section class=\"akn-subsection\"><span class=\"akn-num\">(86)</span><span class=\"akn-content\"><span class=\"akn-p\">Taxes on the capital value of the assets, exclusive of agricultural land, of individuals and companies; taxes on the capital of companies.</span></span></section><section class=\"akn-subsection\"><span class=\"akn-num\">(87)</span><span class=\"akn-content\"><span class=\"akn-p\">Estate duty in respect of property other than agricultural land.</span></span></section><section class=\"akn-subsection\"><span class=\"akn-num\">(88)</span><span class=\"akn-content\"><span class=\"akn-p\">Duties in respect of succession to property other than agricultural land.</span></span></section><section class=\"akn-subsection\"><span class=\"akn-num\">(89)</span><span class=\"akn-content\"><span class=\"akn-p\">Terminal taxes on goods or passengers, carried by railway, sea or air; taxes on railway fares and freights.</span></span></section><section class=\"akn-subsection\"><span class=\"akn-num\">(90)</span><span class=\"akn-content\"><span class=\"akn-p\">Taxes other than stamp duties on transactions in stock exchanges and futures markets.</span></span></section><section class=\"akn-subsection\"><span class=\"akn-num\">(91)</span><span class=\"akn-content\"><span class=\"akn-p\">Rates of stamp duty in respect of bills of exchange, cheques, promissory notes, bills of lading, letters of credit, policies of insurance, transfer of shares, debentures, proxies and receipts.</span></span></section><section class=\"akn-subsection\"><span class=\"akn-num\">(92)</span><span class=\"akn-content\"><span class=\"akn-p\">Taxes on the sale or purchase of newspapers and on advertisements published therein.</span></span></section><section class=\"akn-subsection\"><span class=\"akn-num\">(92A)</span><span class=\"akn-content\"><span class=\"akn-p\">Taxes on the sale or purchase of goods other than newspapers, where such sale or purchase takes place in the course of inter-State trade or commerce.<span class=\"akn-remark\" data-status=\"editorial\">[In the Union List, after entry 92, the following entry shall be inserted through Constitution (Sixth Amendment) Act, 1956]</span></span><span class=\"akn-p\"><span class=\"akn-remark\" data-status=\"editorial\">[<b class=\"akn-b\">Editorial comment</b>- The Constitution (Sixth Amendment) Act, 1956, amendment in Schedule 7 by inserting of entry 92A catering taxes on inter-state commerce and trade excluding newspaper.

schedule of the Indian Constitution, included laws from Kerala focused on land reform. Specifically, it added two acts to the schedule: the Kerala Land Reforms (Amendment) Act, 1969 (Kerala Act 35 of 1969) and the Kerala Land Reforms (Amendment) Act, 1971 (Kerala Act 25 of 1971). However, the legality of the 29th Amendment was challenged in a case brought by a petitioner whose land was subject to seizure under Kerala's Land Reforms. The petitioner also questioned the validity of the 24th and 25th Constitutional Amendments, which they claimed impacted their fundamental rights. This case led to the development of the idea of the fundamental structure of the Constitution. Ultimately, seven judges out of 13 ruled in favor of upholding the legitimacy of the 29th Amendment, although its validity was not upheld completely.

Constitution (Thirty-Fourth Amendment) Act, 1974, remains an important milestone in the evolution of Indian democracy. The amendment brought about significant changes to the constitutional framework of the country, particularly with respect to the powers of the Parliament to amend the Constitution and the rights of the citizens. These proposals were about the removal of exemptions, the reduction of the maximum on land holdings, and the application of a ceiling based on the amount of land owned by a family. The Amendment added 20 more state laws (New entries 67 to 86) dealing with land reforms and ceilings to the Ninth Schedule in order to make it clear that these laws cannot be challenged on the grounds that they conflict with any sections of Part III of the Constitution’s Fundamental Rights clause.<a class=\"akn-ref\" data-eid=\"att_9__subsec_86__p_2__ref_1\" data-href=\"https://blog.examarly.com/upsc/34th-amendment-of-indian-constitution/\" href=\"https://blog.examarly.com/upsc/34th-amendment-of-indian-constitution/\" id=\"att_9__subsec_86__p_2__ref_1\">Also Refer</a> ]</span></span><span class=\"akn-p\"><span class=\"akn-remark\" data-status=\"editorial\">[In the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution, after entry 86 and before the Explanation, the following entries shall be inserted through Constitution (Thirty-Ninth Amendment) Act, 1975]</span></span><span class=\"akn-p\"><span class=\"akn-remark\" data-status=\"editorial\">[<b class=\"akn-b\">Editorial comment</b>-The Constitution (Thirty-Ninth Amendment) Act, 1975, The amendment modified Schedule 9 of the Indian constitution.<a class=\"akn-ref\" data-eid=\"att_9__subsec_86__p_4__ref_1\" data-href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty-ninth_Amendment_of_the_Constitution_of_India\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty-ninth_Amendment_of_the_Constitution_of_India\" id=\"att_9__subsec_86__p_4__ref_1\">Also Refer</a> ]</span></span></span></section><section class=\"akn-subsection\"><span class=\"akn-num\">(87)</span><span class=\"akn-content\"><span class=\"akn-p\">*** <span class=\"akn-remark\" data-status=\"editorial\">[<b class=\"akn-b\">Editorial comment</b>-The Constitution (Forty-Fourth Amendment) Act, 1978, repealed Article 19 (1) (f) and also took out Article 31(1) has been taken out of Part III and made a separate Article 300A in Chapter IV of Part XII.

Additionally, 64 more Central and state laws, most of which dealt with land reforms, were added to the 9th Schedule.\"<a class=\"akn-ref\" data-eid=\"att_9__subsec_124__p_3__ref_1\" data-href=\"https://blog.examarly.com/upsc/40th-amendment-of-indian-constitution/\" href=\"https://blog.examarly.com/upsc/40th-amendment-of-indian-constitution/\" id=\"att_9__subsec_124__p_3__ref_1\">Also Refer</a>]</span></span></span></section><section class=\"akn-subsection\"><span class=\"akn-num\">(125)</span><span class=\"akn-content\"><span class=\"akn-p\">Section 66A and Chapter IVA of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939 (Central Act 4 of1939)</span></span></section><section class=\"akn-subsection\"><span class=\"akn-num\">(126)</span><span class=\"akn-content\"><span class=\"akn-p\">The Essential Commodities Act, 1955 (Central Act 10 of 1955)</span></span></section><section class=\"akn-subsection\"><span class=\"akn-num\">(127)</span><span class=\"akn-content\"><span class=\"akn-p\">The Smugglers and Foreign Exchange Manipulators (Forfeiture of Property) Act,1976 (Central Act 13 of 1976)</span></span></section><section class=\"akn-subsection\"><span class=\"akn-num\">(128)</span><span class=\"akn-content\"><span class=\"akn-p\">The Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976 (Central Act 19 of 1976)</span></span></section><section class=\"akn-subsection\"><span class=\"akn-num\">(129)</span><span class=\"akn-content\"><span class=\"akn-p\">The Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities (Amendment) Act, 1976 (Central Act 20 of 1976)</span></span></section><section class=\"akn-subsection\"><span class=\"akn-num\">(130)</span><span class=\"akn-content\"><span class=\"akn-p\">*** <span class=\"akn-remark\" data-status=\"editorial\">[<b class=\"akn-b\">Editorial comment</b>-The Constitution (Forty-Fourth Amendment) Act, 1978, repealed Article 19 (1) (f) and also took out Article 31(1) has been taken out of Part III and made a separate Article 300A in Chapter IV of Part XII. This amendment may have taken away the scope of speedy remedy under Article 32 for the violation of Right to Property because it is no more a Fundamental Right. Making it a legal right under the Constitution serves two purposes: Firstly, it gives emphasis to the value of socialism included in the preamble and secondly, in doing so, it conformed to the doctrine of basic structure of the Constitution. <a class=\"akn-ref\" data-eid=\"att_9__subsec_130__p_1__ref_1\"

As per this amendment of the Indian constitution Act, 55 land reforms were included in the 9th schedule by various States to protect them from judicial scrutiny.
