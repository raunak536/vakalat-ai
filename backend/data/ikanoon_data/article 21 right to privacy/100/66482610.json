The question for consideration in this appeal is whether Prime Minister‟s National\nRelief Fund (&quot;the Fund/Appellant&quot;) is a „public authority‟ within the ambit of <a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_1\">Section\n2(h)</a> of the Right to Information Act, 2005 (&quot;<a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_2\">RTI Act</a>&quot;). The learned single judge held\nthat it was, upholding the decision of the authorities under the Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_2\">2.      The respondent in the appeal (hereafter &quot;the petitioner&quot;) in 2011, applied to the\nCPIO, Prime Minister&#x27;s Office (&quot;CPIO&quot;) for information pertaining to the various\ntransactions made PMNRF during the financial year 2009-2010 and 2010-2011\n(&quot;Information Period&quot;). The CPIO, provided some of the information sought; the CPIO\nhowever invoked the exemption under <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 8(l)(j)</a> of the RTI Act, as regards\ninformation related to amount, name and particular of each recipient, beneficiary and\ndonor during the information period. Aggrieved the petitioner appealed under <a href=\"/doc/641330/\" id=\"a_4\">Section\n19(1)</a> of the Act to the Appellate Authority. The Authority directed the CPIO to send a\nfresh response to the petitioner, which was duly complied with; the petitioner, aggrieved,\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">LPA 231/2016                                                            Page 1 of 24</span>\n preferred a second appeal before the Chief Information Commissioner (&quot;CIC&quot;) under\n<a href=\"/doc/1852611/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 19(3)</a>. The CIC then passed a final order directing the CPIO to place the details\nof institutional donors of the PMNRF in public domain and to disclose the information to\nthe petitioner. Aggrieved, the Fund preferred a writ petition (W.P.(C) No.3897/2012)\nbefore this Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_3\">3.     The Learned Single Judge found the CIC‟s order to be balanced, and dismissed\nthe appeal. However, while passing the impugned judgment dated 19.11.2015, the\nlearned Single Judge refrained from giving a conclusive finding as to whether the\nappellant was a public authority. Aggrieved by the decision of the Learned Single Judge,\nthe Appellant filed the present appeal.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">CONTENTIONS\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_5\">4.     The Fund contends that PMNRF is not obliged to provide any information to the\nRespondent as it is not a „public authority‟ under the ambit of <a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 2(h)</a> of the RTI\nAct. Second, the information sought by the respondent is exempt under <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of\nthe RTI Act as it relates to personal information the disclosure of which has no\nrelationship to any public activity and that it causes unwarranted invasion of the privacy\nof individuals. With regards to the first ground, the Fund contends that PMNRF is a\nprivate fund comprising of voluntary donations made by individuals and institutions and\nis not a business of the Central Government. Therefore no right to information can be\nenforced against it. The Fund further contends that PMNRF does not owe its\nestablishment to an order of the government and does not receive any funds or finances\nby the government, thus, it is not a public authority under <a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 2(h)</a> of the RTI Act. It\nwas also contended that while passing the impugned judgment the Learned Single Judge\nhad failed to consider that the appellant finds its genesis in a personal appeal made\nthrough a press note dated 24.01.1948 by the then Prime Minister, Pt. Jawahar Lal Nehru.\nThis, according to the Fund, was a personal appeal/request/decision and not an\norder/decision made by the Government of India. The Fund further contended that this\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">LPA 231/2016                                                             Page 2 of 24</span>\n appeal/request/decision was not a decision of the Central Government and was thus not\nmade in the name of the Hon&#x27;ble Governor General of India, the head of Central\nExecutive as was then required for decisions of Central Government.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_6\">5.       The Appellant further contends that no question as regards to the operations of\nPMNRF are permitted to be made in the parliament in terms of Rule\n47(2)(viii)1&amp;47(2)(xviii)2 of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in Rajya\nSabha and Rule 41(2)(viii) and 41(2)(xvii)3 of Rules of Procedure and Conduct of\nBusiness in Lok Sabha respectively. It is so because PMNRF does not owe its genesis to\na decision/function of Central Executive under <a href=\"/doc/1831074/\" id=\"a_9\">Sections 7</a>, <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_10\">8</a> or 17 of the <a href=\"/doc/93056159/\" id=\"a_11\">Government of\nIndia Act, 1935</a> (which is in pari materia to <a href=\"/doc/1597349/\" id=\"a_12\">Articles 53</a><a href=\"/doc/883495/\" id=\"a_13\">, 73</a><a href=\"/doc/990669/\" id=\"a_14\">, 77</a> of Constitution of India\nrespectively). The Fund contends that PMNRF is divested of any government character\nas no guideline can be laid down for disbursement of amount from PMNRF, as it is not a\npart of any Government Scheme or business of the Central Government and also not\nsubject to audit of Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG). All these points,\nmake PMNRF fall outside the scope of „public authority‟ as defined under <a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 2(h)</a>\nof the RTI Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_7\">6.       On the second ground, i.e. the exemption from providing information of donors,\nthe Fund urges that the right to privacy of specific donors is protected under <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_16\">Section\n8(1)(j)</a> of the RTI Act. The information sought is third party information and no public\npurpose would be served in making public the details of amounts given by donors. The\nFund also contends that the information held by it creates a fiduciary relationship\nbetween the donors and the PMNRF, thereby exempting the information sought under\n<a href=\"/doc/1494553/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 8(1)(e)</a> of the RTI Act. The Appellant/Fund contends that the purpose of <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_18\">RTI Act</a>\nis to ensure transparency and accountability in the functioning of public authorities and\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">1</span>\n  Rule 47(2)(viii) reads as, &quot;47: Conditions of admissibility of questions: (2) The right to ask a question is\ngoverned by the following conditions: - (viii) it shall not relate to a matter which is not primarily the\nconcern of the Government of India&quot;.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">2</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_8\">  Rule 47(2)(xviii) reads as, &quot;47: Conditions of admissibility of questions: (2) The right to ask a question\nis governed by the following conditions: - (xviii) it shall not raise matters under the control of bodies or\npersons not primarily responsible to the Government of India\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">3</span>\n  Rule 41(2)(viii) and 41(2)(xvii) are couched in a same phraseology as the aforementioned Rajya Sabha\nRules respectively.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">LPA 231/2016                                                                            Page 3 of 24</span>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\"> not of a specific donor. It is further contended that disclosure without consent of the\ninstitutional donor would also be contrary to customary and traditional belief of Gupt\nDaan followed by many of Indian public.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_10\">7.     Saying that this appeal lacks merit, the petitioner contends that PMNRF is headed\nby the Prime Minister of India and administered by a Joint Secretary to the Prime\nMinister as Secretary of the fund. In addition, he is assisted by the officer of the rank of a\ndirector. Thus, the fund is completely managed by the government officials and comes\nunder the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office. The disbursement is also for the Citizens of India to\nprovide relied to families of those effected by the natural calamities like flood, cyclones\nand earthquakes etc, which is an important public function.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_11\">8.     The petitioner contends that the term „public authority‟ as used in <a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 2(h)</a> of\nthe RTI Act is wider in scope than the term „Government of India‟ as used in the relevant\nRajya Sabha and Lok Sabha Rules. It is also contended by the Fund it is not a public\nauthority as no specific expenditure is incurred by the Consolidated Fund of India as\nthere is no separate office of the PMNRF nor any separate staff has been allocated by the\ngovernment for management of the said fund. This is substantiated by the fact that Prime\nMinister delegates his powers to operate the fund upon one of the officers of PMO for\nsmooth management of the fund. The said officer takes secretarial assistance from the\nFunds Division of the PMO, which is established to manage other funds of the PMO. It is\nsignificant to note that all concerned in the management of the PMNRF including those\nproviding secretarial assistance work on honorary basis while discharging their primary/\nordinary assigned duties.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_12\">9.     The petitioner contended that there would be no harm in disclosing the details of\nthe donors and the beneficiaries of this fund. It is further argued that the information has\nbeen desired in larger public interest to know as to whether uniform rational criteria is\nfollowed. The disclosure of the information sought, the petitioner contends, will reveal\nwhether any personal bias is shown while distribution of funds. As regards the right to\nprivacy, it is argued that disbursement from the fund becomes a matter of „public record‟.\nOnce the Prime Minister exercises his exclusive discretion in deciding beneficiaries, the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">LPA 231/2016                                                               Page 4 of 24</span>\n confidential relationship which may have existed ends. Therefore, once something\nbecomes a matter of &#x27;public record&#x27; subsequently, the right of privacy no longer exists.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_13\">Analysis and Reasoning\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_14\">10.    From the foregoing contentions, the following issues arise in the present appeal: -\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">       (a)     Whether PMNRF is a „public authority‟ as defined under <a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 2(h)</a> of\n               the RTI Act?\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">       (b)     Whether the information sought by the Respondent, insofar as it relates to\n               the amount, name and particular of each recipient, beneficiary and donor,\n               could be placed in public domain?\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_15\">11.    <a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 2(h)</a> of the RTI Act which defines „public authority‟ is reproduced\nbelow:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">       &quot;(h) &quot;public authority&quot; means any authority or body or institution of\n       self-government established or constituted --\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">               (a) by or under the Constitution;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">               (b) by any other law made by Parliament;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">               (c) by any other law made by State Legislature;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">               (d)by notification issued or order made by the appropriate\n               Government, and includes any--\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">                       (i) body owned, controlled or substantially financed;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">                       (ii) non-Government Organisation substantially\n                       financed, directly or indirectly by funds provided by the\n                       appropriate Government;&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_16\">12.    The PMNRF was established pursuant to an appeal made by way of a press note\ndated 24/01/1948 by the then Prime Minister Jawahar Lal Nehru. He felt the need to\nhave such a fund to make ends meet in the hard times owing to rioting and exodus from\nPakistan on occasion of partition of India. In 1973, an application was filed before the\nIncome Tax authority under <a href=\"/doc/1199969/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 12A</a> of the Income Tax Act, 1961 to register the\nfund as a &quot;Trust&quot; for the purposes of Income Tax exemption. The said application of the\nFund was allowed by the Commissioner of Income Tax on 18.09.1973 and the fund was\nregistered as a &quot;Trust&quot; bearing No. DLI(C)(T-25)/73-74. Subsequently, the fund was also\nallocated a separate Permanent Account Number (PAN). Though, no specific Trust Deed\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">LPA 231/2016                                                             Page 5 of 24</span>\n was executed for the said purpose, the fund was, however, deemed to be a &quot;Trust&quot;.\nFinally, in 1985, the Managing Committee of PMNRF entrusted the entire management\nof the said fund to the Prime Minister who was given the discretion to appoint a secretary\nof the fund to manage it. Since its inception, the PMNRF has been receiving voluntary\ndonations from individuals and institutions. The funds so received by it are disbursed to\nprovide immediate relief from natural calamities, major accidents, serious ailments, riot,\netc. as per discretion and under directions of the Prime Minister.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_17\">13.    The genesis of PMNRF reveals that it is a body which is not established by or\nunder the Constitution or by any other law made by the Parliament or by any other law\nmade by State Legislature. Therefore, PMNRF is not a „public authority‟ as prescribed\nunder Clauses (a) to (c) of sub-Section (h) of <a href=\"/doc/277989/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 2</a> of the RTI Act. What needs\nconsideration whether PMNRF can be said to be a „public authority‟ as defined under\n<a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 2(h)(d)</a> of the RTI Act. The Fund argues that the Press Note dated 24/01/1948\nwas an appeal made Pt. Nehru in his personal capacity and that it was not a decision of\nthe Central Government at that time. Therefore, it cannot amount to a body established\n&quot;by notification issued or order made by the appropriate Government&quot; under <a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_25\">Section\n2(h)(d)</a> of the RTI Act. This court is of the opinion that directions of the Prime Minister\ninviting contributions and setting up a Committee comprising of the Prime Minister\nhimself along with the Deputy Prime Minister, Finance Minister and other important\nhighest state functionaries as „Managers‟ of PMNRF cannot be deemed to be or be\nconsidered as actions in a personal capacity. Those actions are meant to considered to be\nactions of the Government which the Prime Minster represents. Further, registration of\nPMNRF as a Trust for the purposes of income tax exemption, obtaining of Permanent\nAccount Number (PAN) of the said fund and entrusting the management of the fund\nqualify as an „order made by the appropriate government‟. Therefore, PMNRF must be\ndeemed to be a „public authority‟ within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 2(h)(d)</a> of the RTI Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\">14.    The use of expression „includes‟ in clause (d) of <a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 2(h)</a> of the Act clearly\nindicates that the definition is illustrative and not exhaustive. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1015973\" id=\"span_9\">In <a href=\"/doc/1015973/\" id=\"a_28\">Commissioner of Income\nTax v. Taj Mahal Hotel</a>, (1971) 3 SCC 550, it was held at paragraph 6 that:</span>\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">LPA 231/2016                                                             Page 6 of 24</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">        &quot;The word &quot;includes&quot; is often used in interpretation clauses in order\n       to enlarge the meaning of the words or phrases occurring in the body\n       of the statute. When it is so used, those words and phrases must be\n       construed as comprehending not only such things as they signify\n       according to their nature and import but also those things which the\n       interpretation clause declares that they shall include.&quot; (emphasis\n       supplied)\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1149874\" id=\"span_11\">15.    Furthermore, it was held in <a href=\"/doc/1149874/\" id=\"a_29\">Reserve Bank of India v. Peerless General Finance\nand Investment Co. Ltd.</a> (1987) 1 SCC 424 that:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">       &quot;Interpretation must depend on the text and the context. They are the\n       bases of interpretation. One may well say if the text is the texture,\n       context is what gives the colour. Neither can be ignored. Both are\n       important. That interpretation is best which makes the textual\n       interpretation match the contextual...&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_20\">16.    The object of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_30\">RTI Act</a> is to promote transparency in the working of every\n„public authority‟ and democracy requires an informed citizenry. Transparency of\ninformation have been considered vital to the functioning of democracy, to eliminate\nopacity in functioning and to hold Governments and their instrumentalities accountable\nto the governed. Therefore, in light of the object of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_31\">RTI Act</a>, the term „public\nauthority‟ must be subjected to a liberal interpretation. Arguendo, were the Court to\nassume that the PMNRF was a body not established &quot;by notification issued or order\nmade by the appropriate Government&quot;, recourse must be made to sub-Clauses (i) and (ii)\nof <a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 2(h)(d)</a>. As highlighted by the learned Single Judge, PMNRF cannot be said to\nbe a non-Government Organisation. This excludes the applicability of <a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 2(h)(d)(ii)</a>\nof the RTI Act in the present matter. Therefore, only testing parameter left is sub-Clause\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_21\">(i) of <a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 2(h)(d)</a> i.e. „body owned, controlled or substantially financed‟ by the\nappropriate government.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"37517217\" id=\"span_12\">17.

Control: The meaning of the term „controlled‟ as used under <a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 2(h)(d)(i)</a>\nwas explained by the Supreme Court in Thalappalam Service Coop. Bank Ltd., as\nfollows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">       &quot;44. We are of the opinion that when we test the meaning of\n       expression &quot;controlled&quot; which figures in between the words &quot;body\n       owned&quot; and &quot;substantially financed&quot;, the control by the appropriate\n       Government must be a control of a substantial nature. The mere\n       &quot;supervision&quot; or &quot;regulation&quot; as such by a statute or otherwise of a\n       body would not make that body a &quot;public authority&quot; within the\n       meaning of <a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 2(h)(d)(i)</a> of the RTI Act. In other words, just like a\n       body owned or body substantially financed by the appropriate\n       Government, the control of the body by the appropriate Government\n       would also be substantial and not merely supervisory or regulatory....\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">       45. We are, therefore, of the view that the word &quot;controlled&quot; used in\n       <a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 2(h)(d)(i)</a> of the Act has to be understood in the context in\n       which it has been used vis-à-vis a body owned or substantially\n       financed by the appropriate Government, that is, the control of the\n       body is of such a degree which amounts to substantial control over the\n       management and affairs of the body.&quot; (emphasis supplied)\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_24\">19.

Further, once PMNRF was deemed to be a Trust, the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">LPA 231/2016                                                             Page 8 of 24</span>\n Managing Committee entrusted the entire management of PMNRF to the Prime Minister.\nSince then, the fund is headed by the Prime Minister of India who in turn appoints his\ndelegate for the administering the same under his directions. It has been accepted that\nmerely because certain Government Servants hold a position in his/her ex-officio\ncapacity, ipso facto that does not mean that the Government is exercising control through\nthe ex-officio members [<a href=\"/doc/72002030/\" id=\"a_39\">Army Welfare Housing Organization Vs. Adjutant</a> General‟s\nBranch, (2015) 216 DLT 184 (DB),]. However, PMNRF is not managed by mere officers\nor government employees. It is PMNRF is headed by Constitutional Authority, i.e. the\nPrime Minister of India and administered by the Joint Secretary to the Prime Minister- as\nSecretary of the fund. In addition, who is assisted by the officer of the rank of a director.\nFurthermore, all disbursements from PMNRF are made solely on the discretion of the\nPrime Minister. He or she is a public authority and decisions taken by him or her with\nrespect to operation of PMNRF cannot be said to be made in a personal capacity. The\ndecisions of the Prime Minister in this regard must be taken to be official decisions. To\nsay that the use of funds is a personal decision, is a half truth. No doubt, the decision of\nwhere to use the funds or make disbursements, is subjective and discretion dependent.\nHowever, the use of those funds are not for a personal purpose; rather it is always for\nsome public purpose.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_26\">21.    The fund receives voluntary donations from individuals and institutions. Further,\nit is stated by the Fund that no expenditure is incurred in the management of the PMNRF\nas it is managed on an honorary basis by all involved. Thus, further discussion on this\npoint is not warranted as PMNRF the fund‟s infrastructure is not in any way different\nfrom the Central Government‟s. Its secretary holds the position as a nominee of the\nPrime Minister; he is none other than a Central services officer, i.e. Joint Secretary.\nThe fund is housed in the Prime Minister‟s office.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_27\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"38400934\" id=\"span_16\">22.    It is also pertinent to note that the three conditions mentioned in <a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 2(h)(d)(i)</a>\nof the RTI Act are distinct and not cumulative, therefore, even if one of the three is\nsatisfied as per the facts of the case, it would be sufficient and there is no need for all\nthree to be satisfied.

The only requirement for a private body\n       or an NGO to be covered by the term „public authority‟ is that either\n       it must be a body controlled or substantially financed by the\n       Government. Therefore, the tests applied to bring an organisation\n       within the definition of <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_49\">Article 12</a> are unnecessary to interpret <a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_50\">Section\n       2(h)(d)(i)</a> and (ii) of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_51\">RTI Act</a>.

As is evident from foregoing, it can be reasonably concluded that there exists\ngovernmental control in the management of PMNRF. Therefore, the conditions in Clause\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_31\">(i) of <a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_58\">Section 2(h)(d)</a> are satisfied.

The court further notices that the fund, on one hand, admits to providing\ninformation as far as possible and then claims that it is not bound to give any\ninformation. Being a public body entrusted with the task of providing immediate relief\nfrom natural calamities, major accidents, serious ailments, riot, etc, PMNRF should have\ndisclosed the entire information about its transactions and fulfil its obligations under\n<a href=\"/doc/13503/\" id=\"a_60\">Section 4</a> of the RTI Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_33\">27.    Having established that PMNRF is a „public authority‟ within the ambit of the\n<a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_61\">RTI Act</a> brings us to the second issue, i.e., whether the information sought by the\nRespondent, insofar as it relates to the amount, name and particular of each recipient,\nbeneficiary and donor, could be placed in public domain. Right to information is a\nfundamental right but it is not uncontrolled. It has its limitations. The right is subject to a\ndual check. Firstly, this right is subject to the restrictions inbuilt within the Act, and\nsecondly, the constitutional limitations emerging from <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_62\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_34\">28.    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"55517912\" id=\"span_21\">In this regard, it was held by the        Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/55517912/\" id=\"a_63\">Bihar Public Service\nCommission v.

Both the said stipulations aim at striking a balance between an individual‟s right\nto obtain information and another individual‟s right to privacy.

Even if, there is any indication to the contrary,\n       still there is no obligation on the public authority to give information\n       to any citizen of what has been mentioned in clauses (a) to (j). The\n       public authority, as already indicated, cannot access all the\n       information from a private individual, but only that information which\n       he is legally obliged to pass on to a public authority by law, and also\n       only those information to which the public authority can have access\n       in accordance with law. Even those information, if personal in nature,\n       can be made available only subject to the limitations provided in\n       <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_73\">Section 8(j)</a> of the RTI Act. Right to be left alone, as propounded\n       in Olmstead v. United States [72 L Ed 944: 277 US 438 (1928)] is the\n       most comprehensive of the rights and most valued by civilised man.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"160205361\" id=\"span_23\">64. Recognising the fact that the right to privacy is a sacrosanct facet\n       of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_74\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution, the legislation has put a lot of\n       safeguards to protect the rights under <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_75\">Section 8(j)</a>, as already\n       indicated. If the information sought for is personal and has no\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">LPA 231/2016                                                            Page 12 of 24</span>\n        relationship with any public activity or interest or it will not sub-serve\n       larger public interest, the public authority or the officer concerned is\n       not legally obliged to provide that information.

Further, if the authority\n       finds that information sought for can be made available in the larger\n       public interest, then the officer should record his reasons in writing\n       before providing the information, because the person from whom\n       information is sought for, has also a right to privacy guaranteed\n       under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_78\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_37\">31.

The argument of the Secretary General that the asset declarations of judges was\nheld by the Chief Justices in a fiduciary relationship was rejected for these reasons:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">       &quot;58. From the above discussion, it may be seen that a fiduciary\n       relationship is one whereby a person places complete confidence in\n       another in regard to a particular transaction or his general affairs or\n       business. The relationship need not be &quot;formally&quot; or &quot;legally&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_39\">       ordained, or established, like in the case of a written trust; but can be\n       one of moral or personal responsibility, due to the better or superior\n       knowledge or training, or superior status of the fiduciary as compared\n       to the one whose affairs he handles. If viewed from this perspective, it\n       is immediately apparent that the CJI cannot be a fiduciary vis-à-vis\n       Judges of the Supreme Court; he cannot be said to have superior\n       knowledge, or be better trained, to aid or control their affairs or\n       conduct. Judges of the Supreme Court hold independent office, and\n       are there is no hierarchy, in their judicial functions, which places\n       them at a different plane than the CJI. In these circumstances, it\n       cannot be held that asset information shared with the CJI, by the\n       judges of the Supreme Court, are held by him in the capacity of a\n       fiduciary, which if directed to be revealed, would result in breach of\n       such duty. So far as the argument that the 1997 Resolution had\n       imposed a confidentiality obligation on the CJI to ensure non-\n       disclosure of the asset declarations, is concerned, the court is of\n       opinion that with the advent of the Act, and the provision in <a href=\"/doc/1971086/\" id=\"a_80\">Section\n       22</a> - which overrides all other laws, etc. (even overriding the <a href=\"/doc/61492784/\" id=\"a_81\">Official\n       Secrets Act</a>) the argument about such a confidentiality condition is on\n       a weak foundation. The mere marking of a document, as\n       &quot;confidential&quot;, in this case, does not undermine the overbearing\n       nature of <a href=\"/doc/1971086/\" id=\"a_82\">Section 22</a>. Concededly, the confidentiality clause (in the\n       1997 Resolution) operated, and many might have bona fide believed\n       that it would ensure immunity from access. Yet the advent of the Act\n       changed all that; all classes of information became its subject\n       matter. <a href=\"/doc/1000068/\" id=\"a_83\">Section 8 (1) (f)</a> affords protection to one such class, i.e.\n       fiduciaries. The content of such provision may include certain kinds of\n       relationships of public officials, such as doctor-patient relations;\n       teacher-pupil relationships, in government schools and colleges;\n       agents of governments; even attorneys and lawyers who appear and\n       advise public authorities covered by the Act. However, it does not\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">LPA 231/2016                                                              Page 14 of 24</span>\n        cover asset declarations made by Judges of the Supreme Court, and\n       held by the CJI.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_40\">       59. For the above reasons, the court concludes the petitioners&#x27;\n       argument about the CJI holding asset declarations in a fiduciary\n       capacity, (which would be breached if it is directed to be disclosed, in\n       the manner sought by the applicant) to be insubstantial. The CJI does\n       not hold such declarations in a fiduciary capacity or relationship.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_41\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1519371\" id=\"span_28\">The Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/1519371/\" id=\"a_84\">CBSE v.

The term &quot;fiduciary relationship&quot; is used to\n       describe a situation or transaction where one person (beneficiary)\n       places complete confidence in another person (fiduciary) in regard to\n       his affairs, business or transaction(s). The term also refers to a person\n       who holds a thing in trust for another (beneficiary). The fiduciary is\n       expected to act in confidence and for the benefit and advantage of the\n       beneficiary, and use good faith and fairness in dealing with the\n       beneficiary or the things belonging to the beneficiary. If the\n       beneficiary has entrusted anything to the fiduciary, to hold the thing\n       in trust or to execute certain acts in regard to or with reference to the\n       entrusted thing, the fiduciary has to act in confidence and is expected\n       not to disclose the thing or information to any third party.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_42\">33.    In the present matter, the Fund does not offer any service to the donors or the\nbeneficiaries.   Furthermore,     the    relationship   between     PMNRF          and   the\ndonors/beneficiaries does not take colour of a „fiduciary relationship‟ as described above.\nThe donors do not repose trust in PMNRF in conducting their business and the same\nholds true for the beneficiaries. On the contrary, the act of donation is an act of charity\nwhich is not sufficient to establish a fiduciary relationship. Therefore, the question of\nthere existing a fiduciary relationship does not arise. Consequently, the defence of\nexemption sought by the Appellant under <a href=\"/doc/1494553/\" id=\"a_85\">Section 8(1)(e)</a> of the RTI Act is not\nsustainable.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">LPA 231/2016                                                             Page 15 of 24</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_43\"> 34.    As far as the exception in <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_86\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the RTI Act goes, the court is of the\nopinion that citizens have a right to know about the management of a fund which is used\nfor benign purposes, inter alia, like providing relief in times of natural disasters.\nA disclosure of such information will ensure that the voluntary donations made by the\ncitizen body is not appropriated by any government official. In this regard, the disclosure\nof the information sought by the petitioner indeed serves a public purpose. Furthermore,\nthe Court holds that disclosure of such information will not cause any unwarranted\ninvasion of privacy of an individual. This is because once the fund is already disbursed to\na beneficiary, the disbursement becomes a matter of „public record‟. Once the Prime\nMinister exercises his or her exclusive right to determine the beneficiaries or class of\nbeneficiaries, the confidential relationship which may have existed comes to an end.\nTherefore, once something becomes a matter of &#x27;public record&#x27;, the right of privacy\nceases to exist. Additionally, any violation of an individual‟s Right to Privacy can be\ncontested by the concerned Third Party under the procedure prescribed under <a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_87\">Section 11</a>\nof the RTI Act. Therefore, the arguments put forth by the Appellant on this ground\ncannot be sustained as well.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_44\">35.    In light of the foregoing discussion, the Court holds that whilst PMNRF does not\nreceive funding from the Central or State Governments, yet, it is administered in the\noffice of the Prime Minister in accordance with the policy which exists in the public\ndomain. This is on the strength of the prestige lent by the Prime Minister, his office and\nthe confidence that is generated that such amounts would be used for funds in the\nexercise of discretion for many contingencies that the donor may visualize, (or not\nvisualize, but is confident would reach deserving beneficiaries or causes). It has to be\nemphasized that the appeal to generosity (in seeking donation) inherent through the\nnature of the fund is the confidence and trust that millions of donors repose in the Prime\nMinister and the office of the prime minister. All those seconded to the office of the fund\nare public servants; they have no personal stake or interest. Such a fund cannot but be\ncalled as a public fund. The Prime Minister has no personal stake or interest in the receipt\nor disbursement. The disbursement of amounts is towards deserving and noble causes,\nespecially in unforeseen contingencies and calamities. Donations to the fund come from\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">LPA 231/2016                                                             Page 16 of 24</span>\n all kinds of sources including, sometimes, State Undertakings, both Central and State.\nMany such donors may even publicise about their donations in the media.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_45\">36.    As regards other submissions, especially the provisions of the Rules of Business\nof the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha or that the fund is not subject to audit by the CAG,\nthis court notices that <a href=\"/doc/1971086/\" id=\"a_88\">Section 22</a> of the RTI Act overrides all other laws; the effect is that\nany impediment or bar- in any law in force- to the supply of information is overborne and\nhas to be disregarded. In this court‟s view, disclosure of the information sought by the\napplicant petitioner is reasonable; the impugned judgment cannot be faulted. The appeal\nis without merit and therefore, dismissed. No costs.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_46\">                                                                    S.

So, it will be fallacious to assume that all the decisions of\nappellant-Trust are taken by the Prime Minister alone, so as to label it as an official\ndecision.

The resources of the PMNRF\n        are now utilized primarily to render immediate relief to families of\n        those killed in natural calamities like floods, cyclones and\n        earthquakes, etc. and to the victims of the major accidents and riots.\n        Assistance from PMNRF is also rendered, to partially defray the\n        expenses for medical treatment like heart surgeries, kidney\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">LPA 231/2016                                                                 Page 18 of 24</span>\n        transplantation, cancer treatment and acid attack etc. The fund\n       consists entirely of public contributions and does not get any\n       budgetary support. The corpus of the fund is invested with scheduled\n       commercial banks in various forms. Disbursements are made with the\n       approval of the Prime Minister. PMNRF has not been constituted by\n       the Parliament. The fund is recognized as a Trust under the <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_96\">Income\n       Tax Act</a> and the same is managed by Prime Minister or multiple\n       delegates for national causes. PMNRF operates from the Prime\n       Minister&#x27;s Office, South Block, New Delhi-110011 and does not pay\n       any license fee. PMNRF is exempt under <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_97\">Income Tax Act, 1961</a> under\n       <a href=\"/doc/580445/\" id=\"a_98\">Section 10</a> and 139 for return purposes.

It is so said because these State Functionaries manage the\nPMNRF in their ex-officio capacity. If PMNRF is not non-governmental organization,\nthen what is it? Prime Minister or any of the Managers of PMNRF does not have a legal\ntitle or basis to claim ownership of PMNRF. In fact, PMNRF is a Trust which is neither\nowned, controlled or financed by the Government.            As explained in President‟s\n<a href=\"/doc/56774592/\" id=\"a_103\">Secretariat v.

If at all, the second issue is to be considered, though not necessary,\ntraditional custom of „Gupt Daan‟ needs to be viewed in light of Supreme Court‟s\nConstitution Bench decision in Justice K.S.
