He joined the Delhi\n      Judicial Service on 21.9.1971 as Sub Judge, First Class. With\n      effect from 3.12.1980, he assumed the office as Commissioner of\n      Payments in the Ministry of Commerce under the <a href=\"/doc/90447170/\" id=\"a_7\">Sick Textile\n      Undertakings (Nationalization) Act, 1974</a>.

Hence the application\n      itself is not maintainable and is liable to be rejected outright.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_5\">      Appellant Shri Alok Singhai submitted that the fact that the Registry of the\nHigh Court has sought one excuse or another to deny the information sought to\nappellant would indicate that in seeking to conceal the information that it holds\nwith regard to Mr. Justice Ripusudan Dayal. Otherwise, there is no reason why\nthe declaration of moveable / immoveable property filed by Shri Dayal during his\nservice in the Delhi Judicial Services, which is required to be submitted by law, is\nnot being disclosed. Shri Singhai went on to explain the reasons why he sought\nthis information but was informed that this Commission is in no way authorized to\nseek such reasons.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_6\">                               DECISION NOTICE\n\n\n      <a href=\"/doc/22288/\" id=\"a_8\">Sec. 8(3)</a> of the Right to Information Act, 2005 states clearly, as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">      8(3)\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                         3</span>\n        Subject to the provisions of clauses (a), (c) and (i) of sub-section\n       (1), any information relating to any occurrence, event or matter\n       which has taken place, occurred or happened twenty years before\n       the date on which any request is made under <a href=\"/doc/1910806/\" id=\"a_9\">section 6</a> shall be\n       provided to any person making a request under that section\n\n       Provided that where any question arises as to the date from which\n       the said period of twenty years has to be computed, the decision of\n       the Central Government shall be final, subject to the usual appeals\n       provided for in this Act.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_7\">       In other words, Learned Counsel for the Delhi High Court is entirely in\nerror in submitting that because the information pertains to a period prior to 20\nyears from the date of receipt of the application, that it cannot be provided. Infact\nthe reverse is the law.      Also the law, however, is the fact that access to\ninformation can only be provided, as per <a href=\"/doc/13329432/\" id=\"a_10\">Sec. 2(j)</a>, which reads as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">       2(j)\n\n       &quot;right to information&quot; means the right to information accessible\n       under this Act, which is held by or under the control of any public\n       authority and includes the right to--\n</blockquote><pre id=\"pre_2\">       (i)     inspection of work, documents, records;\n       (ii)     taking notes, extracts or certified copies of documents or\n               records;\n       (iii)   taking certified samples of material;\n       (iv)    obtaining information in the form of diskettes, floppies, tapes,\n</pre><blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">               videocassettes or in any other electronic mode or through\n               printouts where such information is stored in a computer or\n               in any other device;\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"155236387\" id=\"span_5\">Appellant&#x27;s plea that respondents have simply changed their stand is\nexplained by the ruling of both a Single Judge in WP(Civil) 288/2009               -\nSecretary General, Supreme Court of <a href=\"/doc/155236387/\" id=\"a_11\">India vs. Subhash Chandra Agrawal &amp;\nAnr.</a> of 2.9.&#x27;09,in which Hon&#x27;ble Ravinder Bhat J has ruled on the disclosability of\nthe property statements of the Justices of the Supreme Court and upheld by the\ndecision of the Delhi High Court in Full Bench in LPA No. 501/2009 in which the\nCoram consisting of Hon&#x27;ble Chief Justice A.

In the present case, the only information that was sought by\n     the respondent was whether such declaration of assets were filed\n     by Judges of the Supreme Court and also whether High Court\n     Judges have submitted such declarations about their assets to\n     respective Chief Justices in States. The respondent had not sought\n     a copy of the declaration or the contents thereof or even the names\n     etc., of the Judges providing the same. Release of this information\n     would not amount to actionable breach of any confidentiality. The\n     duty to confirm or deny would not amount to breach of\n     confidentiality unless the request is so specific that the mere\n     confirmation that information is held (without a disclosure of that\n     information) would be to disclose the gist of the information. Philip\n     Coppel explains the legal position as follows:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">             &quot;The duty to confirm or deny&quot;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">             &quot;The duty to confirm or deny does not arise if, or to the\n             extent that, a confirmation or denial that the public authority\n             holds the information specified in the request would (apart\n             from the Act) constitute an actionable breach of confidence.\n             This is an absolute exclusion of duty. As a matter of practice,\n             other than where the request is so specific that the mere\n             confirmation that the information is held (without a disclosure\n             of that information) would be to disclose the gist of the\n             information, it is difficult to LPA 501/2009 page 75 of 88\n             contemplate circumstances in which a public authority could\n             properly refuse to confirm or deny that it held information\n             under S.41(2)&quot;. (page 843)\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">     107. In our opinion, the learned single Judge has summed up the\n     position correctly in Para 58:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">             &quot;From the above discussion, it may be seen that a fiduciary\n             relationship is one whereby a person places complete\n             confidence in another in regard to a particular transaction or\n             his general affairs or business. The relationship need not be\n             &quot;formally&quot; or &quot;legally&quot; ordained, or established, like in the\n             case of a written trust; but can be one of moral or personal\n             responsibility, due to the better or superior knowledge or\n             training, or superior status of the fiduciary as compared to\n             the one whose affairs he handles. If viewed from this\n             perspective, it is immediately apparent that the CJI cannot\n             be a fiduciary vis-à-vis Judges of the Supreme Court; he\n             cannot be said to have superior knowledge, or be better\n             trained, to aid or control their affairs or conduct. Judges of\n             the Supreme Court hold independent office, and there is no\n             hierarchy, in their judicial functions, which places them at a\n             different plane than the CJI. In these circumstances, it\n             cannot be held that asset information shared with the CJI, by\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                        5</span>\n             the judges of the Supreme Court, are held by him in the\n            capacity of a fiduciary, which if directed to be revealed,\n            would result in breach of such duty. So far as the argument\n            that the 1997 Resolution had imposed a confidentiality\n            obligation on the CJI to ensure non-disclosure of the asset\n            declarations, is concerned, the court is of opinion that with\n            the advent of the Act, and the provision in <a href=\"/doc/1971086/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 22</a> -\n            which overrides all other laws, etc. (even overriding the\n            <a href=\"/doc/61492784/\" id=\"a_13\">Official Secrets Act</a>) the argument about such a\n            confidentiality condition is on a weak foundation. The mere\n            marking of a document, as &quot;confidential&quot;, in this case, does\n            not undermine the overbearing nature of <a href=\"/doc/1971086/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 22</a>.\n            Concededly, the confidentiality clause (in the 1997\n            Resolution) operated, and many might have bona fide\n            believed that it would ensure immunity from access. Yet the\n            advent of the Act changed all that; all classes of information\n            became its subject matter. <a href=\"/doc/1000068/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 8(1)(f)</a> affords protection\n            to one such class, i.e. fiduciaries. The content of such\n            provision may include certain kinds of relationships of public\n            officials, such as doctor-patient relations; teacher-pupil\n            relationships, in government schools and colleges; agents of\n            governments; even attorneys and lawyers who appear and\n            advise public authorities covered by the Act. However, it\n            does not cover asset declarations made by Judges of the\n            Supreme Court, and held by the CJI.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_8\">     108. For the above reasons, we hold that <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 8(e)</a> does not\n     cover asset declarations made by Judges of the Supreme Court\n     and held by the CJI. The CJI does not hold such declarations in a\n     fiduciary capacity or relationship.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_9\">POINT 3: WHEHTER INFORMATION ABOUT DECLARATION OF ASSETS BY\nJUDGES IS EXEMPT UNDER SECTION 8(1)(j).\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_10\">     109. The learned Attorney General argued that the information,\n     which is sought for by the respondent, is purely and simply\n     personal information, the disclosure of which has no relationship to\n     any public activity. He emphasized that access to such information\n     would result in unwarranted intrusion of privacy. The submission is\n     that such information is exempt under <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the Act. On\n     the other hand, Mr.Prashant Bhushan argues that information as to\n     whether declarations have been made, to the CJI can hardly be\n     said to be called &quot;private&quot; and that declarations are made by\n     individual judges to the CJI in their capacity as Judges. He\n     submitted that the present proceeding is not concerned with the\n     content of asset declarations.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\">RIGHT TO INFORMATION VIS-À-VIS RIGHT TO PRIVACY\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"619152\" id=\"span_8\">110. The right to privacy as an independent and distinctive concept\n     originated in the field of Tort law, under which the new cause of\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                    6</span>\n action for damages resulting from unlawful invasion of privacy was\nrecognized. This right has two aspects: (i) The ordinary law of\nprivacy which affords a tort action for damages resulting from an\nunlawful invasion of privacy and (ii) the constitutional recognition\ngiven to the right to privacy which protects personal privacy against\nunlawful government invasion. Right to privacy is not enumerated\nas a fundamental right in our Constitution but has been inferred\nfrom <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_18\">Article 21.</a> The first decision of the Supreme Court dealing with\nthis aspect is <a href=\"/doc/619152/\" id=\"a_19\">Kharak Singh v. State of UP</a>, AIR 1963 SC 1295.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1068532\" id=\"span_10\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"436241\" id=\"span_11\">A\nmore elaborate appraisal of this right took place in later decisions in\n<a href=\"/doc/436241/\" id=\"a_20\">Gobind v. State of MP</a>, (1975) 2 SCC 148, R.Rajagopal v. State\nof T.N., (<a href=\"/doc/1068532/\" id=\"a_21\">1994) 6 SCC 632 and District Registrar and Collector v.\nCanara Bank</a>, (2005) 1 SCC 496.</span></span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_13\">111. The freedom of information principle holds that, generally\nspeaking, every citizen should have the right to obtain access to\ngovernment records. The underlying rationale most frequently\noffered in support of the principle are, first, that the right of access\nwill heighten the accountability of government and its agencies to\nthe electorate; second, that it will enable interested citizens to\ncontribute more effectively to debate on important questions of\npublic policy; and third, that it will conduce to fairness in\nadministrative decision-making processes affecting individuals. The\nprotection of privacy principle, on the other hand, holds in part at\nleast that individuals should, generally speaking, have some control\nover the use made by others, especially government agencies, of\ninformation concerning themselves. Thus, one of the cardinal\nprinciples of privacy protection is that personal information acquired\nfor one purpose should not be used for another purpose without the\nconsent of the individual to whom the information pertains. The\nphilosophy underlying the privacy protection concern links personal\nautonomy to the control of data concerning oneself and suggests\nthat the modern acceleration of personal data collection, especially\nby government agencies, carries with it a potential threat to a\nvalued and fundamental aspect of our traditional freedoms.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\">112. The right to information often collides with the right to privacy.\nThe government stores a lot of information about individuals in its\ndossiers supplied by individuals in applications made for obtaining\nvarious licences, permissions including passports, or through\ndisclosures such as income tax returns or for census data. When\nan applicant seeks access to government records containing\npersonal information concerning identifiable individuals, it is\nobvious that these two rights are capable of generating conflict. In\nsome cases this will involve disclosure of information pertaining to\npublic officials. In others, it will involve disclosure of information\nconcerning ordinary citizens.

The right to information, being integral part of the right to\n    freedom of speech, is subject to restrictions that can be imposed\n    upon that right under <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_22\">Article 19(2).</a> The revelation of information in\n    actual practice is likely to conflict with other public interests\n    including efficient operations of the Government, optimum use of\n    limited fiscal resources and the preservation of confidentiality of\n    sensitive information and, therefore, with a view to harmonize these\n    conflicting interests while preserving the paramountcy of the\n    democratic ideal, <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 8</a> has been enacted for providing certain\n    exemptions from disclosure of information. <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 8</a> contains a\n    well defined list of ten kinds of matters that cannot be made public.\n    A perusal of the aforesaid provisions of <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 8</a> reveals that there\n    are certain information contained in sub-clause (a), (b), (c), (f),(g)\n    and (h), for which there is no obligation for giving such an\n    information to any citizen; whereas information protected under\n    sub-clause (d), (e) and (j) are protected information, but on the\n    discretion and satisfaction of the competent authority that it would\n    be in larger public interest to disclose such information, such\n    information can be disclosed. These information, thus, have limited\n    protection, the disclosure of which is dependent upon the\n    satisfaction of the competent authority that it would be in larger\n    public interest as against the protected interest to disclose such\n    information.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_17\">    114. There is an inherent tension between the objective of freedom\n    of information and the objective of protecting personal privacy.\n    These objectives will often conflict when an applicant seeks access\n    for personal information about a third party. The conflict poses two\n    related challenges for law makers; first, to determine where the\n    balance should be struck between these aims; and, secondly, to\n    determine the mechanisms for dealing with requests for such\n    information. The conflict between the right to personal privacy and\n    the public interest in the disclosure of personal information was\n    recognized by the legislature by exempting purely personal\n    information under <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the Act. <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> says that\n    disclosure may be refused if the request pertains to &quot;personal\n    information the disclosure of which has no relationship to any public\n    activity or interest, or which would cause unwarranted invasion of\n    the privacy of the individual.&quot; Thus, personal information including\n    tax returns, medical records etc. cannot be disclosed in view of\n    <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the Act. If, however, the applicant can show\n    sufficient public interest in disclosure, the bar (preventing\n    disclosure) is lifted and after duly notifying the third party ( i.e. the\n    individual concerned with the information or whose records are\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                                         8</span>\n sought) and after considering his views, the authority can disclose\nit. The nature of restriction on the right of privacy, however, as\npointed out by the learned single Judge, is of a different order; in\nthe case of private individuals, the degree of protection afforded to\nbe greater; in the case of public servants, the degree of protection\ncan be lower, depending on what is at stake. This is so because a\npublic servant is expected to act for the public good in the\ndischarge of his duties and is accountable for them.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_18\">115. <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_29\">The Act</a> makes no distinction between an ordinary individual\nand a public servant or public official. As pointed out by the learned\nsingle Judge &quot;----- an individual&#x27;s or citizen&#x27;s fundamental rights,\nwhich include right to privacy - are not subsumed or extinguished if\nhe accepts or holds public office.&quot; <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> ensures that all\ninformation furnished to public authorities - including personal\ninformation [such as asset disclosures] are not given blanket\naccess. When a member of the public requests personal\ninformation about a public servant, - such as asset declarations\nmade by him - a distinction must be made between personal data\ninherent to the person and those that are not, and, therefore, affect\nhis/her private life. To quote the words of the learned single Judge\n&quot;if public servants ---- are obliged to furnish asset declarations, the\nmere fact that they have to furnish such declaration would not\nmean that it is part of public activity, or &quot;interest&quot;. ----- That the\npublic servant has to make disclosures is a part of the system&#x27;s\nendeavour to appraise itself of potential asset acquisitions, which\nmay have to be explained properly. However, such acquisitions can\nbe made legitimately; no law bars public servants from acquiring\nproperties or investing their income. The obligation to disclose\nthese investments and assets is to check the propensity to abuse a\npublic office, for a private gain.&quot; Such personal information\nregarding asset disclosures need not be made public, unless a\npublic interest consideration dictates it, under <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 8(1)(j)</a>. This\nsafeguard is made in public interest in favour of all public officials\nand public servants.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_19\">116. In the present case the particulars sought for by the\nrespondent do not justify or warrant protection under <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 8(1)(j)</a>\ninasmuch as the only information the applicant sought was whether\n1997 Resolution was complied with. That kind of innocuous\ninformation does not warrant the protection granted by <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_33\">Section\n8(1)(j)</a>. We concur with the view of the learned single Judge that the\ncontents of asset declarations, pursuant to the 1997 Resolution, are\nentitled to be treated as personal information, and may be\naccessed in accordance with the procedure prescribed under\n<a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 8(1)(j)</a>; that they are not otherwise subject to disclosure.\nTherefore, as regards contents of the declarations, information\napplicants would have to, whenever they approach the authorities,\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                                  9</span>\n      under the Act satisfy them under <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> that such\n     disclosure is warranted in &quot;larger public interest&quot;.\nDISCLOSURE OF ASSETS INFORMATION OF JUDGES - INTERNATIONAL\nTRENDS\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_20\">     117. &quot;Although Judges often balk at the invasion of privacy that\n     disclosure of their private finances entails, it is almost uniformly\n     considered to be an effective means of discouraging corruption,\n     conflicts of interest, and misuse of public funds...&quot; [Guidance for\n     Promoting Judicial Independence and Impartiality, 2001, USAID,\n     Technical Publication]. Income and Asset Disclosure is generally\n     perceived to be an essential aid towards monitoring whether judges\n     perform outside work, monitoring conflicts of interests, discouraging\n     corruption, and encouraging adherence to the standards prescribed\n     by judicial code of conduct. In countries where disclosure is\n     mandatory, &quot;the Guidance Principle&quot; suggests that list of judges\n     assets and liabilities must be declared at appointment and annually\n     thereafter. &quot;Guidance Principle&quot; further stipulates that the\n     information disclosure must be accurate, timely and\n     comprehensive. Furthermore, security and privacy concerns of\n     judges should be respected, oversight body monitoring the register\n     must be credible and the public should have proper access to the\n     public portion of the register.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\">     118. Keith E. Henderson in his article &quot;Asset and Income\n     Disclosure for Judges: A Summary Overview and Checklist&quot; states\n     that even though the OAS Convention created the legal basis for\n     income and asset disclosure of public officials, the legal question as\n     to whether Judges are deemed to be public officials remains\n     unclear or is being debated on in a number of countries. In some\n     countries, Judges have raised issues of constitutional separation of\n     powers and have taken the position that the judicial branch itself\n     must pass and enforce its own disclosure laws and rules. This is\n     exactly what is achieved by the 1997 and 1999 Resolutions. Other\n     unresolved issues relate to how to effectively and fairly implement\n     and enforce disclosure laws and how much of this personal\n     information should be publicly available and in what form. The\n     author has pointed out that there are three basic sources of the\n     assets declaration obligation:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">     a) Constitutional Obligation: Some constitutions impose an\n          obligation to disclose assets of public officials e.g. Colombia,\n          Constitution <a href=\"/doc/1283667/\" id=\"a_36\">Article 122.</a>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">     (b)     Legislative Obligation: Some countries regulate asset\n          disclosure by statute, although there are different types of Acts\n          creating this obligation e.g. Poland, El Salvador, etc.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">     c)    Court rules: In some countries, such as United States,\n          Argentina, the judiciary itself regulates the conduct of Judges.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                                    10</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\"> According to the author, while addressing the issue of assets\ndisclosure, it is fundamental to find a balance between the kind of\ninformation that must be available to the public and the rights to\nprivacy and security of the official or Judge. Corrupt &quot;information\nkeepers&quot; or weak information systems and institutions can result in\nserious information leaks that could have serious human rights\nimplications - particularly in transition countries. A cursory review of\nexisting laws reveals that there is no one model law or policy\nregarding exactly the range of assets Judges should disclose. To\nsome degree, it depends, inter alia, on the development context of\nthe country in question. Regarding the kind of assets to be\ndisclosed, different countries have likewise adopted different\nmodels depending on the development context:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">Broad Disclosure - In the United States, there is an obligation to\nmake a broad accounting of financial holdings, including a list of\ngifts, lecture fees or other outside incomes. However, there has\nbeen some criticism of some judges not fully disclosing their having\nreceived trip expenses from private sources and these rules are still\nunder debate.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">Medium-size disclosure - In Argentina, judges are exempt from\ndeclaring some kinds of property if it might jeopardize their security.\nFor example, judges are not obligated to submit details of the place\nwhere they live or their credit card numbers.\nNarrow disclosure - In many transition countries, judges must\ndeclare only incomes - assets are exempt. &quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_23\">119. The Ethics in Government Act, 1978 of United States requires\nthat federal judges disclose personal and financial information each\nyear. <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_37\">Under the Act</a>, federal judges must disclose the source and\namount of income, other than that earned as employees of the\nUnited States government, received during the preceding calendar\nyear. Judges must also disclose the source description and value of\ngifts, for which the correct value is more than certain minimal\namount, received from any source other than a relative; the source\nand description of reimbursements; the identity and category of\nvalue of property and interests; the identity and category of values\nof liabilities owed to creditors other than certain immediate family\nmembers; and other financial information. <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_38\">The Act</a> allows judges to\nredact information from their financial disclosure request under\ncertain circumstances. A report may be redacted &quot;(i) to the extent\nnecessary to protect the individual who files the report; and (ii) for\nso long as the danger to such individual exists&quot;. <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_39\">The Act</a> further\ncharges the US Judicial Conference Committee with the task of\nsubmitting to the House and Senate Committee on the Judiciary an\nannual report documenting redactions. When a member of the\npublic requests for a copy of judges financial disclosure report, the\nCommittee sends a notification of the request to the judge in\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                                  11</span>\n      question asking the judge to respond in writing whether he would\n     like to request new or additional redactions of information. If the\n     judge does not request redaction from his/her report, a copy of the\n     report is released to the requester. However, if the judge requests\n     redaction upon receiving the request for a copy of the report, the\n     Committee then votes on the redaction request, with a majority\n     needed to approve or deny the request, and finally a copy of the\n     report is released, with approved redactions, if any.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_24\">     120. It will be useful to note certain developments which led to the\n     federal judges asset information being placed on the internet. In\n     September, 1999, APBnews.com (&quot;APB&quot;), a site focused on\n     criminal justice news, requested for financial disclosure reports filed\n     by federal judges in 1998. The Judicial Conference Committee\n     denied this request in December, 1999 ruling that the disclosure\n     reports should not be turned over to APB because posting the\n     reports on the internet would contravene the statutory requirement\n     that all report registers identify themselves by name, occupation\n     and address. After the Judicial Conference Committee denied\n     APB&#x27;s request, APB filed suit in the US District Court for southern\n     districts of New York to obtain the report. But on March 14, 2000,\n     the Judicial Conference Committee voted to reverse its decision\n     and allowed the reports to be available on the internet, recognizing\n     that the statutory language did not permit withholding the reports in\n     their entirety from news organizations. Though the Act generally\n     prohibits obtaining or using a report for commercial purposes, it\n     contains an exemption for &quot;news and communication media&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">     involved in &quot;dissemination to the general public&quot;. Thus APB could\n     not be refused access to the reports. Before the forms were\n     released to the APB, however, the Committee removed some\n     personal information submitted by judges but not required by the\n     Act, such as home addresses and names of spouses and\n     dependants.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">EPILOGUE\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\">     121. It was Edmund Burke who observed that &quot;All persons\n     possessing a portion of power ought to be strongly and awfully\n     impressed with an idea that they act in trust and that they are to\n     account for their conduct in that trust.&quot; Accountability of the\n     Judiciary cannot be seen in isolation. It must be viewed in the\n     context of a general trend to render governors answerable to the\n     people in ways that are transparent, accessible and effective.\n     Behind this notion is a concept that the wielders of power -\n     legislative, executive and judicial - are entrusted to perform their\n     functions on condition that they account for their stewardship to the\n     people who authorize them to exercise such power.
