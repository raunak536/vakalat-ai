Plaintiff has filed the suit O.S.No.1/2010 for\n\nthe relief of partition and allotment of half share in the\n\nsuit schedule property and to declare that the gift deed\n\ndated 20.11.2009 executed by first defendant in favour\n\nof third defendant is null and void. The contention of\n\nplaintiff in brief as alleged in the suit is:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">      First defendant Sri. P.H.Subbrayappa is his father;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">second defendant is the second wife and she is a &#x27;Dasi&#x27;\n\nas per Hindu Law and third defendant is the son born\n\nthrough second defendant and &#x27;Dasi Putra&#x27;, plaintiff is\n\nthe son of first defendant through his first wife Smt.\n\nB.N.Radhamma. Hence, claiming that he and first\n\ndefendant constitute a Hindu Undivided Joint Family,\n\nhas sought for share in the suit property. Though\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                7</span>\n\n\n\nseveral pleas have been raised in the plaint, this Court\n\nis of the considered view that it would not be necessary\n\nto delve upon them, since it would have no bearing on\n\nthe adjudication of impugned orders.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">     5.      On service of suit summons, defendants - 1\n\nto 3 have appeared and filed their written statement and\n\nit is specifically denied that first defendant is the father\n\nof plaintiff and it is contended that plaintiff is the\n\nsecond son of late Sri.K.L.Vasanthaiah. It is also\n\ncontended that marriage of first defendant with second\n\ndefendant     was     with    the   consent   of    first   wife\n\nSmt.B.N.Radhamma. It was also admitted by the\n\ndefendants     that   first   defendant   has      executed   a\n\nregistered gift deed in favour of third defendant.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_5\">However, it is contended that it is the self acquired\n\nproperty of first defendant.

First defendant entered the witness box as\n\nD.W.1 and on behalf of defendants D.W.2 to D.W.5 were\n\ngot examined and got marked Exs.D-1 to D-59(a).\n\nD.W.5 is Smt.B.N.Radhamma, whom plaintiff claims as\n\nhis biological mother.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\">\nRE: W.P.No.36236/2015:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_12\">      8.     In   this   writ   petition,   order   passed    on\n\nI.A.No.49, which is an application filed by plaintiff\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_9\">Order 14 Rule 5 of CPC</a> for recasting of issue\n\nNo.1 which has been allowed, is called in question. In\n\nthe   affidavit   supporting      the   application,   it    was\n\ncontended by the plaintiff that issue No.1 is erroneously\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                 11</span>\n\n\n\nframed by putting the burden of proof on the plaintiff\n\ncontending interalia that defendants 1 to 3 have\n\nadmitted the marriage of first defendant with his first\n\nwife Smt.

Hence,\n\nseeking   shifting   of   the   burden   of   proof   on   the\n\ndefendants, issue No.1 was sought for being recasted.\n\nObjections to said application came to be filed by the\n\ndefendants denying the averments made in the plaint\n\nand contending that since plaintiff has claimed that he\n\nis the son of first defendant born through Smt.\n\nRadhamma, Court below has rightly cast burden on\n\nplaintiff to prove the said issue. It was also specifically\n\ncontended that Smt.Radhamma could not bear any\n\nchildren and as such, first defendant married second\n\ndefendant and on account of Smt.Radhamma herself\n\nhaving entered the witness box and denied that plaintiff\n\nis not her son, burden was on plaintiff to prove issue\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                             12</span>\n\n\n\nNo.1 and there was no necessity to recast issue No.1.\n\nHence, defendants sought for rejection of I.A.No.49.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_13\">      9.    Trial   Court    after      considering      rival\n\ncontentions, on the ground that <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 112</a> read with\n\n<a href=\"/doc/750738/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 4</a> of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 (hereinafter\n\nreferred to as &#x27;Act&#x27; for short) would completely debar the\n\nparty from leading any evidence with respect to the fact\n\nwhich the law says to be the conclusive proof of\n\nlegitimacy and paternity of child, held that since\n\ndefendants 1 to 3 have admitted the marriage of\n\ndefendant    No.1    with    his     first   wife     namely,\n\nSmt.Radhamma and plaintiff has been contending that\n\nhe is their son, a presumption under <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 112</a> of the\n\nAct is available to him and the onus to rebut the said\n\npresumption is on the defendants and as such, held\n\nthat burden is on defendant 1 to 3 to prove this fact.\n\nHence, ordered for recasting of issue No.1 and following\n\nissue came to be re-casted by deleting the issue framed\n\nearlier:\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                             13</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_14\">\n\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">           Recasted Issue No.1.\n</blockquote>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">     &quot;1.

It is the contention of Sri. S.K.Venkata\n\nReddy, learned counsel appearing for petitioners that\n\ndefendants 1 to 3 in their written statement have not\n\nonly denied that plaintiff is not the son of first\n\ndefendant, but have also contended that plaintiff is the\n\nsecond son of Sri.K.L.Vasanthaiah.            It is in this\n\nbackground, trial Court had rightly cast the burden on\n\nplaintiff to prove issue No.1 and re-casted issue would\n\nindicate a negative burden has been cast on defendants\n\nand same is impermissible since burden always lies on\n\nthe plaintiff to establish his case for which he has\n\nsought for relief. Hence, he prays for allowing the writ\n\npetition by setting aside the order dated 31.07.2015 -\n\nAnnexure-A.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                               14</span>\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_16\">     11.   Per    contra,     Sri.

Having     heard        the    learned   Advocates\n\nappearing for parties and on perusal of pleadings and\n\norder under challenge, as also the issues framed\n\ninitially and issue No.1 and which came to be re-casted,\n\nit would disclose that plaintiff has filed a suit for\n\npartition and separate possession of suit properties,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                             15</span>\n\n\n\ncontending interalia that he is the son of first defendant\n\nborn through Smt.

It is in this background, issue\n\nNo.1 was cast by the trial Court on 03.11.2012 by\n\ncasting the burden on plaintiff to prove that he is the\n\nbiological son of first defendant born through Smt.\n\nRadhamma, first wife of first defendant.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_19\">       13.   Under <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_14\">Order 14 Rule 5 CPC</a> the Court has\n\npower to amend the issues framed including framing of\n\nadditional issue at any time before passing of a decree\n\non such terms as it thinks fit, which in its opinion may\n\nbe necessary for determining the matters in controversy\n\nbetween the parties. A bare reading of Order 14 Rule\n\n1(1)   <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_15\">CPC</a>    would   indicate   that   when   a   material\n\nproposition of fact or law is affirmed by one party and\n\ndenied by the other, then, an issue would arise for being\n\nframed. Whoever desires any Court to give a judgment\n\nas to any legal right dependent on the existence of facts\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                             16</span>\n\n\n\nwhich he asserts, must prove that those facts exist. ei\n\nincumbit probatio qui dicit, non qui negate - The\n\nproof lies upon   him who affirms, not upon him would\n\ndenies. In other words, burden will lie on the party who\n\nasserts the fact to be taken note of by the Court in his\n\nfavour and as such, burden shifts on the person so\n\nasserting. cum per rerum naturam factum negantis\n\nprobatio nulla sit - Since by the nature of things he\n\nwho denies a fact cannot produce any proof. In other\n\nwords, a negative is usually incapable of proof.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_20\">     14.     Thus, onus is always on a person who\n\nasserts a proposition or fact, which is not self evident.\n\nFor instance, to assert that a man who is alive was born\n\nrequires no proof.    The onus, is not on the person\n\nmaking the assertion, because it is self evident that he\n\nhad been born. However, if he asserts that he had been\n\nborn on a certain date or to a certain person, it requires\n\nproof, the onus would be on the person making such\n\nassertion.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                              17</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_21\">\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_22\">15.   The burden of proof cannot be held would\n\nalways be static. It keeps oscillating and in the event\n\nof the initial burden cast on a person is discharged by\n\ntendering evidence in that regard, then automatically,\n\nthe burden shifts on the other person to disprove the\n\nsaid fact and likewise, it shifts back to the person who\n\noriginally asserted the said fact on other person\n\ndischarging his burden by rebuttal evidence.             In this\n\nbackground, when the facts on hand are examined, it\n\nwould clearly disclose that plaintiff has categorically\n\nasserted in the plaint that first defendant is his father\n\nand he was born through his first wife Smt.Radhamma.\n\nPlaintiff in paragraph 2 of the plaint has stated as\n\nunder:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">            &quot;2. The 1st defendant is the father of the\n            plaintiff.  The second defendant xxx\n            parties to the suit. The 1st wife of 1st\n            defendant is alive and since she did not\n            derive any right over the suit properties\n            during the life time of 1st defendant, she\n            has not been arrayed as party to this\n            proceedings. The plaintiff is the son of\n            1st defendant through his 1st wife\n            Radhamma.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_23\">      16.   On the basis of above pleading, plaintiff has\n\ncontended that he and first defendant constituted a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                                     18</span>\n\n\n\nHindu undivided joint family and as such, he is entitled\n\nfor a share in the suit properties. It is because of this\n\nspecific plea raised, burden had been cast on the\n\nplaintiff under issue No.1 which has since been re-\n\ncasted.     Only in the event of plaintiff discharging the\n\nsaid burden, defendants would be required to disprove\n\nthe said fact. Mere production of documents like School\n\nrecords would not give scope for presumption being\n\nraised with regard to existence of facts.             An admission\n\ninsofar as facts are concerned would bind the maker of\n\nadmission but not insofar as it relates to a question of\n\nlaw vide <a href=\"/doc/430855/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 17</a> of the Evidence Act.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_24\">      17.    At the same time, it requires to be noticed\n\nthat defendants had also raised a plea in their written\n\nstatement filed on 16.04.2010 to the effect that first\n\ndefendant is not the father of plaintiff and plaintiff is the\n\nsecond      son   of   late   Sri    K.L.Vasanthaiah.      In   the\n\nadditional written statement filed on 19.10.2012, it is\n\nspecifically pleaded by defendants that plaintiff is not\n\nthe       biological      son            of   first      defendant\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                            19</span>\n\n\n\nSri     P.H.Subbarayappa     and      his   first   wife\n\nSmt.Radhamma.      It is also pleaded that parents of\n\nplaintiff    are     Sri        K.L.Vasanthaiah     and\n\nSmt.B.N.Rangamma of Bukkapatna, Koratagere Taluk.\n\nIn the light of said plea, trial Court ought not to have\n\ndeleted issue No.1 and substituted the same by\n\nrecasting it on 31.07.2015, but on the other hand, it\n\ncould have retained the original issue which was framed\n\non 03.11.2012 and also framed the additional issue,\n\nwhich has now been re-casted on 31.07.2015. In other\n\nwords, both the issues could have been retained so as\n\nto give an effective finding on the pleadings of parties\n\nsince burden of proof does not depend upon the form of\n\nproposition but burden of proving a claim or defence is\n\non the party who asserts it.     The burden lies on the\n\nperson who would fail if no evidence were given on\n\neither side. Whenever the law places a burden of proof\n\nupon a party, a presumption operates against it. Thus,\n\nburden of proof and presumption have to be considered\n\ntogether.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                               20</span><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_25\">\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\">       18.

Hence, it is hereby ordered that issue No.1\n\noriginally cast on 03.11.2012 be retained along with\n\nissue casted on 31.07.2015 for the respective parties to\n\nprove the plea asserted by them and to the said extent,\n\norder under challenge dated 31.07.2015 - Annexure-A\n\nrequires to be modified.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_27\">\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">RE: W.P.No.31182/2016</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_28\">       19.

Hence, it is\n\npleaded by first defendant that to arrive at the truth,\n\nplaintiff should be subjected to DNA test along with him\n\nand Smt.Radhamma.

It     is     the          contention      of      Sri\n\nA.V.Gangadharappa, learned Advocate appearing for\n\npetitioner that order passed by trial Court is erroneous,\n\nsince it has failed to consider the positive evidence\n\navailable on record namely, Annexures-A to E produced\n\nbefore trial Court, which came to be marked as\n\nExhibits.P-1,   P-2,    P-72,        Annexure-G     and     other\n\ndocuments, which clearly indicate that plaintiff is the\n\nson of first defendant and Smt. Radhamma. He would\n\nalso contend that defendants not only admit that\n\nSmt.Radhamma was the first wife of first defendant and\n\nsolemnization of their marriage in the year 1950 and as\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                            22</span>\n\n\n\nsuch, access to each of them is proved and thereby a\n\npresumption arises that Smt.Radhamma and first\n\ndefendant were living together for more than 280 days\n\nand as such, presumption arises with regard to\n\npaternity of child born during the subsistence of a valid\n\nmarriage and same cannot be rebutted by a DNA test -\n\nproof. Only the non-access of wife to husband can be\n\nproved by rebuttal evidence and the evidence led by\n\nplaintiff and admissions tendered by defendants and all\n\nthe witnesses have failed to prove non-access of first\n\ndefendant to Smt.Radhamma and as such, trial Court\n\nought not have allowed the application for conducting\n\nDNA test.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_33\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_34\">     22.

The question that has to be\nanswered in this case is in respect of the\nalleged infidelity of the appellant wife.\nThe respondent husband has made clear\nand categorical assertions in the petition\nfiled by him under <a href=\"/doc/1284729/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 13</a> of the\nHindu Marriage Act, alleging infidelity.\nHe has gone to the extent of naming the\nperson who was the father of the male\nchild born to the appellant wife. It is in\nthe process of substantiating his\nallegation of infidelity that the respondent\nhusband had made an application before\nthe Family Court for conducting a DNA\ntest which would establish whether or not\nhe had fathered the male child born to\nthe appellant wife. The respondent feels\nthat it is only possible for him to\nsubstantiate the allegations leveled by\nhim (of the appellant wife&#x27;s infidelity)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">                   29</span>\n\n\n\n\nthrough a DNA test. We agree with him.\nIn our view, but for the DNA test, it would\nbe impossible for the respondent\nhusband to establish and confirm the\nassertions made in the pleadings. We are\ntherefore satisfied that the direction\nissued by the High Court, as has been\nextracted hereinabove, was fully justified.\nDNA testing is the most legitimate and\nscientifically perfect means, which the\nhusband could use, to establish his\nassertion of infidelity.      This should\nsimultaneously be taken as the most\nauthentic, rightful and correct means\nalso with the wife, for her to rebut the\nassertions made by the respondent -\nhusband, and to establish that she had\nnot been unfaithful, adulterous or\ndisloyal. If the appellant wife is right, she\nshall be proved to be so.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"139951018\" id=\"span_35\">18. We would, however, while\nupholding the order passed by the High\nCourt, consider it just and appropriate to\nrecord a caveat, giving the appellant wife\nliberty to comply with or disregard the\norder passed by the High Court, requiring\nthe holding of the DNA test. In case, she\naccepts the direction issued by the High\nCourt, the DNA test will determine\nconclusively the veracity of accusation\nleveled by the respondent husband\nagainst her. In case, she declines to\ncomply with the direction issued by the\nHigh Court, the allegation would be\ndetermined by the court concerned by\ndrawing a presumption of the nature\ncontemplated in <a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 114</a> of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">                   30</span>\n\n\n\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_32\">Evidence Act</a>, especially, in terms of\nIllustration (h) thereof. <a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 114</a> as\nalso Illustration (h<a href=\"/doc/139951018/\" id=\"a_34\">)<a href=\"/doc/139951018/\" id=\"a_35\">, <a href=\"/doc/139951018/\" id=\"a_36\">referred to above</a></a></a>, are\nbeing extracted hereunder:</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">      &quot;114.

The\n           result of DNA test is said to be\n           scientifically accurate. Although <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_43\">Section\n           112</a> raises a presumption of conclusive\n           proof on satisfaction of the conditions\n           enumerated therein but the same is\n           rebuttable. The presumption may afford\n           legitimate means of arriving at an\n           affirmative legal conclusion. While the\n           truth or fact is known, in our opinion,\n           there is no need or room for any\n           presumption. Where there is evidence to\n           the    contrary,    the  presumption      is\n           rebuttable and must yield to proof. The\n           interest of justice is best served by\n           ascertaining the truth and the court\n           should be furnished with the best\n           available science and may not be left to\n           bank upon presumptions, unless science\n           has no answer to the facts in issue.

We must understand the\n           distinction between a legal fiction and the\n           presumption of a fact.        Legal fiction\n           assumes existence of a fact which may not\n           really exist. However, a presumption of a\n           fact depends on satisfaction of certain\n           circumstances.     Those     circumstances\n           logically would lead to the fact sought to\n           be presumed. <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 112</a> of the Evidence\n           Act does not create a legal fiction but\n           provides for presumption.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_50\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"43471013\" id=\"span_42\">30.

The\n           allegation was that Teeku Dutta was not\n           the daughter of the deceased.

The High Court held\nthat the trial court being a testamentary\ncourt, the parties should be left to prove\ntheir respective cases on the basis of the\nevidence produced during trial, rather\nthan creating evidence by directing DNA\ntest. When the matter reached this Court,\nfew decisions of this Court, particularly,\nGoutam Kundu were noticed and it was\nheld that even the result of a genuine DNA\ntest may not be enough toe escape from\nthe conclusiveness of <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_47\">Section 112</a> of the\nEvidence Act like a case where a husband\nand wife were living together during the\ntime of conception.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"505918\" id=\"span_45\">This is what this\nCourt said; (<a href=\"/doc/505918/\" id=\"a_48\">Banarsi Dass</a> case, SCC pp.\n454-55, para 13)\n\n     &quot;13. We may remember that\n     <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_49\">Section 112</a> of the Evidence\n     Act was enacted at a time\n     when the modern scientific\n     advancements              with\n     deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)\n     as well as ribonucleic acid\n     (RNA) tests were not even in\n     contemplation        of    the\n     legislature. The result of a\n     genuine DNA test is said to be\n     scientifically accurate.  But\n     even that is not enough to\n     escape          from       the\n     conclusiveness of <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_50\">Section 112</a>\n     of the Evidence Act e.g. if a\n     husband and wife were living\n     together during the time of\n     conception but the DNA test\n     revealed that the child was\n     not born to the husband, the\n     conclusiveness in law would\n     remain irrebuttable. This may\n     look hard from the point of\n     view of the husband who\n     would be compelled to bear\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">                   35</span>\n\n\n\n      the fatherhood of a child of\n      which he may be innocent.</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_51\">      But even in such a case the\n      law leans in favour of the\n      innocent child from being\n      bastardized if his mother and\n      her    spouse     were    living\n      together during the time of\n      conception.       Hence, the\n      question regarding the degree\n      of proof of non-access for\n      rebutting the conclusiveness\n      must be answered in the light\n      of what is meant by access or\n      non-access     as    delineated\n      above.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_52\">       It was emphasized that DNA\ntest is not to be directed as a matter\nof routine and only in deserving\ncases such a direction can be given.&quot;\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">&quot;21. In a matter where paternity of\na child is in issue before the court,\nthe use of DNA test is an extremely\ndelicate and sensitive aspect. One\nview is that when modern science\ngives the means of ascertaining the\npaternity of a child, there should not\nbe any hesitation to use those\nmeans whenever the occasion\nrequires. The other view is that the\ncourt must be reluctant in the use\nof such scientific advances and tools\nwhich result in invasion of right to\nprivacy of an individual and may not\nonly be prejudicial to the rights of\nthe    parties     but    may    have\ndevastating effect on the child.\nSometimes the result of such\nscientific test may bastardise an\ninnocent child even though his\nmother and her spouse were living\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">                   36</span>\n\n\n\ntogether   during      the   time   of\nconception.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">22. In our view, when there is\napparent conflict between the right\nto privacy of a person not to submit\nhimself     forcibly    to    medical\nexamination and duty of the court to\nreach the truth, the court must\nexercise its discretion only after\nbalancing the interest of the parties\nand on due consideration whether\nfor a just decision in the matter,\nDNA test is eminently needed. DNA\ntest in a matter relating to paternity\nof a child should not be directed by\nthe court as a matter of course or in\na routine manner, whenever such a\nrequest is made. The court has to\nconsider diverse aspects including\npresumption under <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_51\">Section 112</a> of\nthe Evidence Act: pros and cons of\nsuch order and the test of &quot;eminent\nneed&quot; whether it is not for the court\nto reach the truth without use of\nsuch test.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">23. There is no conflict in the two\ndecisions of this Court, namely,\nGoutam Kundu and Sharada. In\nGoutam Kundu it has been laid\ndown that courts in India cannot\norder blood test as a matter of\ncourse and such prayers cannot be\ngranted to have roving inquiry; there\nmust be strong prima facie case and\nthe court must carefully examine as\nto what would be the consequence\nof ordering the blood test.         In\nSharada while concluding that a\nmatrimonial court has power to\norder a person to undergo a medical\ntest, it was reiterated that the court\nshould exercise such a power if the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">                             37</span>\n\n\n\n           applicant has a strong prima facie\n           case and there is sufficient material\n           before    the   Court.     Obviously,\n           therefore, any order for DNA test\n           can be given by the court only if a\n           strong prima facie case is made out\n           for such a course.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_53\">     31.   As to whether ordering or subjecting a\n\nperson to a medical test would be in violation of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_52\">Article\n\n21</a> of the Constitution of India or not, has been\n\nconsidered by the Apex Court in the case of SHARADA\n\nvs. DHARAMPAL reported in (2003) 4 SCC 493 and it\n\ncame to be held that it would not be in violation of right\n\nto personal liberty enshrined under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_53\">Article 21</a> of the\n\nConstitution of India.

Thus, the Civil Court although may\nnot have any specific provisions in <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_57\">the\nCode of Civil Procedure</a> and the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_58\">Evidence\nAct</a>, has an inherent power in terms of\n<a href=\"/doc/56600062/\" id=\"a_59\">Section 151</a> of the Code of Civil Procedure\nto pass all orders for doing complete\njustice to the parties to the suit.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_50\">                  39</span><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_56\">\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_57\">33.

In all such matrimonial\ncases where divorce is sought, say on the\nground of impotency, schizophrenia etc.\nnormally without there being medical\nexamination, it would be difficult to arrive\nat a conclusion as to whether the\nallegation made by his spouse against the\nother spouse seeking divorce on such a\nground, is correct or not. In order to\nsubstantiate      such    allegation,    the\npetitioner would always insist on medical\nexamination. If the respondent avoids\nsuch medical examination on the ground\nthat it violates his/her right to privacy or\nfor that matter right to personal liberty as\nenshrined      under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_61\">Article    21</a> of    the\nConstitution of India, then it may in most\nof such cases become impossible to arrive\nat a conclusion. It may render the very\ngrounds on which divorce is permissible\nnugatory. Therefore, when there is no\nright to privacy specifically conferred\nby <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_62\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India\nand with the extensive interpretation of\nthe phrase &quot;personal liberty&quot; this right has\nbeen read into <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_63\">Article 21</a>, it cannot be\ntreated as absolute right. What is\nemphasized is that some limitations on\nthis right have to be imposed and\nparticularly where two competing interests\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_51\">                  40</span>\n\n\n\nclash. In matters of the aforesaid nature\nwhere the legislature has conferred a right\nupon his spouse to seek divorce on such\ngrounds, it would be the right of that\nspouse which comes in conflict with the\nso-called right to privacy of the\nrespondent. Thus the Court has to\nreconcile these competing interests by\nbalancing the interests involved.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_61\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_62\">77. If for arriving at the satisfaction of\nthe court and to protect the right of a\nparty to the lis who may otherwise be\nfound to be incapable of protecting his\nown interest, the court passes an\nappropriate order, the question of such\naction being violative of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_64\">Article 21</a> of the\nConstitution of India would not arise. The\ncourt having regard to <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_65\">Article 21</a> of the\nConstitution of India must also see to it\nthat the right of a person to defend himself\nmust be adequately protected.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_63\">78. It is, however, axiomatic that a court\nshall not order a roving inquiry. It must\nhave sufficient materials before it to\nenable it to exercise its discretion.\nExercise of such discretion would be\nsubjected to the supervisory jurisdiction of\nthe High Court in terms of <a href=\"/doc/82577596/\" id=\"a_66\">Section 115</a> of\nthe Code of Civil Procedure and/or <a href=\"/doc/1331149/\" id=\"a_67\">Article\n227</a> of the Constitution of India.

To sum up, our conclusions are:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_44\">                1.     A matrimonial court has the\n           power to order a person to undergo\n           medical test.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_45\">                  2.    Passing of such an order by\n           the court would not be in violation of the\n           right to personal liberty under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_69\">Article 21</a> of\n           the Indian Constitution.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_46\">                  3.   However, the court should\n           exercise such a power if the applicant has\n           a strong prima facie case and there is\n           sufficient material before the court. If,\n           despite the order of the court, the\n           respondent refuses to submit himself to\n           medical examination, the court will be\n           entitled to draw an adverse inference\n           against him.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_47\">     32.   Thus, keeping in mind the above position of\n\nlaw, when the facts on hand are examined it would\n\nindicate that trial Court while ordering for a DNA test by\n\nthe impugned order has held to the following effect:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_48\">         &quot;9.      According to the plaintiff, he is the\n        son of defendant No.1 and Smt. Radhamma.\n        Out of their wed-lock he born in the year\n        1955. The defendant No.1 who appeared\n        before the Court and filed written statement\n        specifically denying the paternity.          The\n        defendant No.1 and Smt. Radhamma\n        specifically denied the birth of plaintiff out of\n        their wed-lock. They contended that plaintiff\n        is the son of K.L. Vasanthaia and Smt.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_53\">                     42</span>\n\n\n\nRangamma (This Rangamma is the sister of\nSmt.Radhamma). Thereby, it appears that\nthe specific dispute between the plaintiff and\ndefendant No.1 is about paternity and birth\nof plaintiff out of the wed-lock of defendant\nNo.1 and Smt.Radhamma.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_49\">10.       Now, both the parties have lead\ntheir part of evidence. Both the parties have\nproduced many documents and produced\noral evidence.      On perusal of entire\nevidence on record still there is an\nambiguity in the mind of the Court as to\nthe paternity of the plaintiff.          The\nambiguity can only be cleared and\nclarified by the experts opinion.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_50\">11.      The    plaintiff  has   specifically\nopposed this application on the ground that\nthe defendant No.1 himself admitted before\nthe Tribunal about the relationship.      He\nfurther contended that the defendant No.1\nhas not proved non-access and there is a\nconclusive presumption under <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_70\">Sec.112</a> of\nIndian Evidence Act. The defendant No.1\nand Smt. Radhamma lead marital life for a\nperiod of 10 years from 1950 to 1960.\nHence, it cannot be held that there is no\nnon-access between them. But it is relevant\nto note here that, the non-access between\nthe defendant No.1 with Smt. Radhamma is\nnot at all disputed by the defendants. Even\nthe martial relationship between the\ndefendant No.1 with Smt. Radhamma is not\nat all disputed and denied by the parties.\nOnly the dispute between the parties is\nwhether the plaintiff is born out of the\nwedlock      of    defendant    No.1     and\nSmt.Radhamma. This is the main question\nbefore the Court. Therefore, question of\nnon-access and presumption Under Sec.112\nof Evidence Act is not applicable to the\npresent case.     The documents and oral\nevidence on record supports the contention\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_54\">                              43</span>\n\n\n\n        of their respective claim. No amount of oral\n        evidence can prove the paternity of the\n        plaintiff. The D.N.A. test will set at rest the\n        dispute between the parties. The evidence\n        on record does not speaks about that the\n        plaintiff is biological son of defendant No.1\n        and Smt. Radhamma or not. Therefore, the\n        opinion of the experts through D.N.A. test is\n        very much necessary to adjudicate the\n        matter in just and proper.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_66\">     33.   Reasons assigned by trail Court for DNA test\n\nas could be seen from the above order is on account of:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_51\">(1) specific dispute between plaintiff and first defendant\n\nabout paternity and birth of plaintiff out of wedlock\n\nbetween defendant No.1 and Smt. Radhamma; (2) still\n\nthere is an ambiguity in the mind of Court as to the\n\npaternity of plaintiff; (3) non-access between defendant\n\nNo.1 and Smt. Radhamma is not being in dispute; and\n\nlastly, (4) records do not speak that plaintiff is the\n\nbiological son of defendant No.1 and Smt. Radhamma.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_67\">     34.   The question of presumption about paternity\n\nof a child under <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_71\">Section 112</a> of the Evidence Act would\n\nbe available when there is no dispute that parties are\n\nhusband and wife or as man and woman living together,\n\nthey had access to each other and living together. There\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\">                                  44</span>\n\n\n\nmay be circumstances where the father in order to avoid\n\nthe    liability   or   to   avoid    discharging    his    marital\n\nobligation arising out of such relationship, may attempt\n\nto stave-off such liability or obligation by raising a\n\ndispute with regard to paternity of the person claiming\n\nto be his son or daughter. It is in this background, law\n\npresumes strongly in favour of legitimacy of an off-\n\nspring, as it is birth that determines the status of a\n\nperson. When a child is born in lawful wedlock, law\n\npresumes that married couple had sexual intercourse\n\nbetween themselves. The principle, underlying the rule\n\nis on the ground of public policy.                  However, the\n\npresumption is rebuttable, but only by very strong and\n\nclear proof of non-access or when there is a strong\n\nevidence to establish that wife was not in a position to\n\nbeget a child or the wife was not in a position to\n\nconceive.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_68\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_69\">       35.    In the instant case, there is no dispute to the\n\nfact   that    first    defendant     was   married        to   Smt.\n\nRadhamma and they lived together for almost 10 years\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_56\">                            45</span>\n\n\n\ni.e., from 1950 to 1960 as could be seen from the\n\nadmission of defendant No.1 himself, who has disputed\n\nthe paternity of plaintiff in his cross examination dated\n\n04.12.2015.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_70\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_71\">     36.   In the instant case, said Smt.Radhamma,\n\nwhom plaintiff claims to be his biological mother has\n\nentered the witness box as DW5 and she has clearly\n\nadmitted that she was married to first defendant in the\n\nyear 1950 and on account of she being unable to\n\nconceive and beget children, she had persuaded her\n\nhusband i.e., first defendant to get married to her\n\nbrother&#x27;s daughter Smt.Gowramma (second defendant)\n\nherein and accordingly, their marriage came to be\n\nsolemnized in the year 1973. She has also stated that\n\nout of said wedlock between first defendant and second\n\ndefendant, third defendant was born.     She also states\n\nthat plaintiff is not her son, he is the son of\n\nSri.K.L.Vasanthaiah and Smt. B.N. Rangamma and they\n\nhad three sons (including plaintiff) and one daughter.\n\nShe also states that said Smt. B.N.Rangamma is none\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_57\">                               46</span>\n\n\n\nother than her sister and as such, she is well aware of\n\nall these facts.   She also states that plaintiff is not born\n\nto her out of her wedlock with first defendant. She has\n\nalso categorically stated that plaintiff has created\n\ncertain documents to depict as though he is the son of\n\nfirst defendant and herself. She also states that said\n\nK.L.Vasanthaiah while being in service was suspended\n\nand as such, plaintiff had come to Pavagada and was\n\nadmitted to the school at Pavagada by her husband -\n\nfirst defendant.      In other words, the person whom\n\nplaintiff claims has given birth to him, has entered the\n\nwitness box and denied that plaintiff is her son and she\n\nhas specifically contended that he is the son of\n\nSri.K.L.Vasanthaiah and Sri.B.N.Rangamma.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_72\">      37.   On the contrary, plaintiff is attempting to\n\nrely upon Annexures-A to E which has been produced\n\nand marked as Exhibits before trial Court to contend\n\nthat first defendant himself had declared that plaintiff is\n\nhis son and as such, a presumption would arise under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_72\">Section 112</a> of the Evidence Act with regard to his\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_58\">                              47</span>\n\n\n\npaternity of plaintiff and in that view of the matter, trial\n\nCourt was not justified in ordering for conducting DNA\n\ntest. First defendant was alive when the trial was being\n\nconducted.     He has entered the witness box and\n\nreiterated the plea raised in his written statement. He\n\nhas also specifically stated in the cross - examination\n\nthat Smt.Radhamma did not conceive or deliver any\n\nchildren. In the light of said rival contentions and both\n\noral and documentary evidence being at variance, trial\n\nCourt was of the considered view that despite entire\n\nevidence being available on record, there is still\n\nambiguity in its mind as to the paternity of plaintiff.\n\nHence, it has ordered for conducting DNA test on the\n\nparties.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_73\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_74\">      38.    Though   learned     Advocate   appearing   for\n\npetitioner has made a valiant attempt to contend that\n\n<a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_73\">Section 112</a> of the Evidence Act is attracted, same\n\nwould not get attracted to the facts on hand, inasmuch\n\nas, it is not the case of defendants, that first defendant\n\nand Smt.Radhamma were not husband and wife or they\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_59\">                                48</span>\n\n\n\nhave never contended that they were not living together\n\nor they have contended that they had no access to each\n\nother. But on the other hand, it is their specific case\n\nthat despite they being husband and wife and living\n\ntogether, she namely, Smt.Radhamma was unable to\n\nbeget children or she did not conceive and it is because\n\nof this precise reason, said Smt.Radhamma herself had\n\narranged the marriage of first defendant with second\n\ndefendant and out of said wedlock third defendant was\n\nborn.     At this stage, her (Smt.Radhamma) evidence\n\ncannot be brushed aside.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_75\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_76\">        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1039362\" id=\"span_60\">39.

We may remember that <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_76\">Section 112</a>\n              of the Evidence Act was enacted at a time\n              when the modern scientific advancements\n              with deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) as well\n              as ribonucleic acid (RNA) tests were not\n              even in contemplation of the legislature.\n              The result of a genuine DNA test is said to\n              be scientifically accurate. But even that is\n              not    enough      to  escape    from   the\n              conclusiveness of <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_77\">Section 112</a> of the Act\n              e.g. if a husband and wife were living\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_61\">                               49</span>\n\n\n\n           together during the time of conception but\n           the DNA test revealed that the child was\n           not    born     to   the   husband,    the\n           conclusiveness in law would remain\n           irrebuttable. This may look hard from the\n           point of view of the husband who would be\n           compelled to bear the fatherhood of a child\n           of which he may be innocent. But even in\n           such a case the law leans in favour of the\n           innocent child from being bastardized if\n           his mother and her spouse were living\n           together during the time of conception.\n           Hence the question regarding the degree of\n           proof of non-access for rebutting the\n           conclusiveness must be answered in the\n           light of what is meant by access or non-\n           access as delineated above.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_77\">     40.

A presumption of a fact depends upon\n\nsatisfaction   of   certain    circumstances.        Those\n\ncircumstances would ultimately lead to the fact sought\n\nto be presumed. This is what <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_79\">Section 112</a> provides for\n\nby way of presumption.             Said Section would be\n\ninapplicable to the facts on hand, inasmuch as, it is not\n\nthe case of first defendant that he had no access to his\n\nwife or there was no cohabitation between them.
