Puram Police Station, Tumkur\n\nalleging, that when his daughter xxxxxx xxxxxxxx, aged about 16\n\nyears was attending online classes from home, the petitioner, a\n\n\n   Page No.3 is retyped and replaced vide Chamber order dated 12.03.2024.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                  4</span>\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">tenant in the house of one Gangadaraiah abutting the house of the\n\ncomplainant, had developed contact with his daughter which he had\n\nnoticed from the room of his house. It is alleged that he had\n\nnoticed that the petitioner began to make gestures from his\n\nwindow, to the window of the daughter of the complainant, when\n\nshe was attending online classes. It is the complaint averment that\n\nthe father checks the mobile phone of his daughter without her\n\nknowledge     and   discovered   that   the   petitioner   was   sending\n\nmessages on whats app which were sexually intimidating and which\n\nwere in the nature of trying to force her to have sexual intercourse\n\nwith him.     Plethora of texts had been exchanged between his\n\ndaughter and the petitioner. This complaint becomes a crime in\n\nCrime No.105 of 2021 for offences punishable under <a href=\"/doc/106760949/\" id=\"a_3\">Sections 354A</a>\n\nand <a href=\"/doc/166765731/\" id=\"a_4\">354B</a> of the IPC and <a href=\"/doc/101331313/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 12</a> of the POCSO Act. Investigation\n\ncommenced against the petitioner after registration of crime.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">      4. The Police conduct a detailed investigation and file a &#x27;B&#x27;\n\nreport observing that it was a false case registered against the\n\npetitioner.   By then, the petitioner had filed Criminal Petition\n\nNo.8172 of 2021 before this Court.        In view of filing of the &#x27;B&#x27;\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                  5</span>\n\n\n\nreport, this Court disposed the petition in terms of its order dated\n\n02-02-2022. After the said order being passed by this Court, the\n\nconcerned Court, after hearing the parties, accepted the &#x27;B&#x27; report\n\nand discharged the accused i.e., the petitioner.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">      5. The issue in the lis does not concern merit of the crime.\n\nThe petitioner is knocking at the doors of this Court, on the ground\n\nthat when the name of the petitioner is clicked on any search\n\nengine, it reveals him to be an accused in the aforesaid crime and\n\npetitioner in Criminal Petition No.8172 of 2021. It is, therefore, the\n\npetitioner seeks masking of his name in the digital records of this\n\nCourt.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_7\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_8\">      6. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner would\n\nvehemently contend that the &#x27;B&#x27; report depicts that it was a false\n\ncase, as the daughter of the complainant and the petitioner were\n\nclose friends and they had exchanged several messages. It was not\n\none sided, but the daughter had also exchanged messages.\n\nTherefore, the Police after investigation filed a &#x27;B&#x27; report, stating it\n\nto be a false case and the complainant did not contest the &#x27;B&#x27;\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                6</span>\n\n\n\nreport. Thereafter, the concerned Court also closes the case\n\naccepting the &#x27;B&#x27; report and discharges the petitioner. She would\n\nsubmit that the digital records still show him as an accused. On\n\naccount of the name being displayed in the website of the High\n\nCourt, he is not getting any job and his brothers also are not\n\ngetting any job, as the moment search is done, it would show that\n\nthe petitioner was an accused. Explanation that he is discharged\n\ncomes about later. But, by then all his job offers vanish. She would\n\ncontend, that if the charge sheet had been filed or there was\n\nconviction, it would have been a different circumstance. The\n\npetitioner is now left without any blame. The digital records depict\n\nhim to be an accused, which has placed him worse than being an\n\naccused. She would submit that every human being is entitled to\n\nlive with dignity. Therefore, she seeks that the name of the\n\npetitioner should be masked in the records of this Court.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_9\">     7. The learned counsel representing the High Court would\n\nvehemently refute the submissions to contend that masking of the\n\nname is permissible only of the victim and not the accused. Merely\n\nbecause he is discharged on accepting the &#x27;B&#x27; report or an accused\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                 7</span>\n\n\n\ngets acquitted, would not mean that his name should not figure as\n\nan accused. It is her submission that the deeds committed by the\n\naccused will always follow him. Therefore, the request of the\n\npetitioner should not be acceded to and merely because his name\n\nfigures it cannot be said that the petitioner is put to any prejudice.\n\nShe would seek dismissal of the petition.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_10\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_11\">      8. I have given my anxious consideration to the submissions\n\nmade by the respective learned counsel and have perused the\n\nmaterial on record.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_12\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_13\">      9. The afore-narrated facts are not in dispute. The petitioner\n\nis alleged of exchanging lewd messages with the daughter of the\n\ncomplainant. Therefore, the crime comes to be registered in Crime\n\nNo.105 of 2021. The police conduct investigation and in the detailed\n\nfinal report would opine that it was a false case and, therefore, &#x27;B&#x27;\n\nreport is filed. The concerned Court accepts the &#x27;B&#x27; report and\n\ncloses the proceedings against the petitioner by discharging him of\n\nthe allegations. The situation is that the petitioner who was once an\n\naccused becomes blame free today.       The charge sheet itself was\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                  8</span>\n\n\n\nnot filed against him, as the investigation led to filing of &#x27;B&#x27; report.\n\nThe &#x27;B&#x27; report, even after it being notified to the complainant was\n\nnot contested and, therefore, the petitioner was discharged on\n\nacceptance of &#x27;B&#x27; report resulting in closure of the case. In those\n\ncircumstances, the name of the petitioner being dubbed as an\n\naccused even after the aforesaid circumstance, undoubtedly leads\n\nto grave prejudice to the petitioner. He is on a higher pedestal than\n\nany of the accused who would get acquitted after a full blown trial.\n\nThe petitioner, at the threshold itself, is declared to be innocent.\n\nThe issue is whether the name of the petitioner-accused should be\n\nmasked in the digital records of this Court. She would submit that\n\nthe other respondents have already yielded to the request of the\n\npetitioner and have masked the name of the petitioner in their\n\nrecords.   What remains is only the masking of the name in the\n\ndigital records of this Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_14\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_15\">      10. The law in this regard cannot be termed to be static, but\n\ndynamic. Dynamic, I deem it necessary to observe, as it should\n\nevolve like evolution of the Constitution of India, which is a dynamic\n\ndocument. A facet of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_6\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India is that\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                  9</span>\n\n\n\nevery citizen in the country should have a life with dignity; the\n\ndignity does get trampled on account of various acts of a citizen.\n\nThose acts are punishable after a due process of law. If the result of\n\ndue process of law is absolving of any person of alleged guilt, those\n\npersons become the ones who would get a right to live with dignity,\n\nhaving no blame against them.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_16\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"127517806\" id=\"span_7\">11. This Court, in plethora of cases, comes about issues\n\nwhere crimes are registered without any rhyme or reason and lead\n\nto quashment of those proceedings in exercise of its jurisdiction\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 482</a> of the Cr.P.C., sometimes on the sole score that\n\nit was frivolous or an act of wreaking vengeance, inter alia.      It is\n\ntherefore, after the accused gets blame-free by a process of law, he\n\ncannot be seen to be carrying the sword of him being accused on\n\nhis head, for all his life. Right to oblivion; right to be forgotten are\n\nthe principles evolved by the democratic nations, as one being a\n\nfacet of right to informational privacy. Countries like France and\n\nItaly, had by themselves evolved the concept of right to oblivion,\n\nwhich dates back to 19th century. Europe, in the European Union\n\nhas, over privacy and personal data, evolved the principle of right\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                          10</span>\n\n\n\nto be forgotten, as a right to be a part of ones right to personality,\n\nwhich encompasses dignity, honour and right to a private life. The\n\naforesaid principles evolved from time to time, can be paraphrased\n\ninto what could become right to life under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_8\">Article 21</a> of the\n\nConstitution of India. It becomes apposite to refer to the judgment\n\nof      the    Apex      Court     in     the   case    of    <a href=\"/doc/127517806/\" id=\"a_9\">JUSTICE     K.S.\n\nPUTTASWAMY(RETD) v. UNION OF INDIA1</a>. The Apex Court\n\nconsiders      various    facets    of     privacy;    one   such   privacy    is\n\ninformational privacy.        On informational privacy, the Apex Court\n\nobserves as follows:</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_18\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">         &quot;Informational privacy\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">                629.

The\n         existence of such a right does not imply that a criminal can\n         obliterate his past, but that there are variant degrees of\n         mistakes, small and big, and it cannot be said that a person\n         should be profiled to the nth extent for all and sundry to know.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">               630.

This does not\nmean that all aspects of earlier existence are to be\nobliterated, as some may have a social ramification. If we\nwere to recognise a similar right, it would only mean that\nan individual who is no longer desirous of his personal\ndata to be processed or stored, should be able to remove\nit from the system where the personal data/information\nis no longer necessary, relevant, or is incorrect and\nserves no legitimate interest. Such a right cannot be\nexercised where the information/data is necessary, for\nexercising the right of freedom of expression and\ninformation, for compliance with legal obligations, for the\nperformance of a task carried out in public interest, on\nthe grounds of public interest in the area of public health,\nfor archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or\nhistorical research purposes or statistical purposes, or for\nthe establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.\nSuch justifications would be valid in all cases of breach of\nprivacy, including breaches of data privacy.&quot;\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\">                                   (Emphasis supplied)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                  13</span>\n\n\n\n\nThe Apex Court considers the entire spectrum the right to privacy\n\nand the &#x27;right to be forgotten&#x27; evolved in the European Union\n\nRegulation of 2016, by the European Parliament. The Apex Court\n\nrecognizes the right to be forgotten to be a basic right under the\n\nright to informational privacy.       It has observed the right of an\n\nindividual to exercise control over his personal data and, to be able\n\nto control his or her own life would encompass his right to control\n\nover its existence on the internet. The Apex Court observes that the\n\nimpact of digital age results in information on the internet being\n\npermanent.    Humans forget, but the internet does not forget and\n\ndoes not let humans forget. Therefore, the soul of the judgment of\n\nthe Apex Court quoted supra is that the footprints in certain\n\ncircumstances should not be permitted to remain, as it is an\n\nanti-thesis to right to be forgotten.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_27\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"49149701\" id=\"span_13\">12.

It is the admitted position that the petitioner\n     was ultimately acquitted of the said charges in the case\n     levelled against him. Owing to the irreparable prejudice\n     which may be caused to the petitioner, his social life\n     and his career prospects, in spite of the petitioner\n     having ultimately been acquitted in the said case via the\n     said judgment, prima facie this Court is of the opinion\n     that the petitioner is entitled to some interim protection,\n     while the legal issues are pending adjudication by this\n     Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_35\">            <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"64737690\" id=\"span_23\">12.

Respondent 1 to ensure\n     compliance of this order.&quot;</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_36\">       7. In the opinion of the court, the fact that the\nentire career of the petitioner, who is a young executive,\nis likely to be jeopardised due to the continued presence\nof the impugned articles on the internet would weigh in\nfavour of directing the removal of these publications.\nMoreover, the court has to draw a balance between the\nright to access information, in general on the one hand\nand the petitioner&#x27;s well-being, mental health, career\nprospects and prospects in life and family on the other\nhand. The fulcrum of any society following the rule of law\nwould be to reform a person and not condemn a person\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                                  19</span>\n\n\n\n      permanently. While bearing these factors in mind and\n      considering the order extracted above, it is deemed\n      appropriate to direct all the publishers i.e. Respondents 3\n      to 10 to remove the articles which have been collectively\n      attached to the petition as Annexure P-1.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_37\">            8.

Evolving this concept of a right to be forgotten or right to\n\nerasure have been the subject matter of the Personal Data\n\nProtection Bills notified from time to time.        The Personal Data\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">                                      20</span>\n\n\n\nProtection Bill, 2018 recognizes the right to be forgotten. Likewise,\n\nthe Personal Data Protection Bill, 2018 also recognizes the right to\n\ncorrection and erasure.          The Government of India notifies the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/3510545/\" id=\"a_19\">Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023</a>, on 11th August, 2023, to\n\ncome into force from the date of its publication in the official\n\ngazette.     <a href=\"/doc/1965344/\" id=\"a_20\">The Act</a> also recognizes the right of erasure of personal\n\ndata. The aforesaid are referred only to lay emphasis, on the fact\n\nthat the law in this regard is also evolving in the country.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_45\">         15. It becomes germane at this juncture, to notice the\n\njudgment of the Queen&#x27;s Bench of the United Kingdom rendered on\n\n13-04-2018, which also recognizes the said principle in NT 1 v.\n\nGOOGLE LLC4 wherein the Queen&#x27;s Bench has held as follows:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">               &quot;1. These two claims are about the &quot;right to be\n         forgotten&quot; or, more accurately, the right to have personal\n         information &quot;delisted&quot; or &quot;de-indexed&quot; by the operators\n         of internet search engines (&quot;ISEs&quot;).\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">               ...                ...                 ...\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">                38. Point 2 highlights the fact that the CJEU regarded the\n         sensitivity of the data in question as an important element in\n         striking the balance. Point 4 explains why it may be misleading\n         to label the right asserted by these claimants as the &quot;right to be\n         forgotten&quot;. They are not asking to &quot;be forgotten&quot;. The first\n         aspect of their claims asserts a right not to be remembered\n         inaccurately. Otherwise, they are asking for accurate\n         information about them to be &quot;forgotten&quot; in the narrow sense of\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">4</span>\n    [2018] EWHC 799 (QB)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">                              21</span>\n\n\n\nbeing removed from the search results returned by an ISE in\nresponse to a search on the claimant&#x27;s name. No doubt a\nsuccessful claim against Google would be applied to and by\nother ISEs. But it does not follow that the information at issue\nwould have to be removed from the public record, or that a\nsimilar request would have to be complied with by a media\npublisher on whose website the same information appeared. In\nthese proceedings the claimants are not asking for any such\nremedy. It is also worth noting here a point that I shall come\nback to: a successful delisting request or order in respect of a\nspecified URL will not prevent Google returning search results\ncontaining that URL; it only means that the URL must not be\nreturned in response to a search on the claimant&#x27;s name.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">       ...                  ...                  ...\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">        101. In my judgment, both versions of the argument\nwould fail on the alternative ground that the processing involved\nwhen Google Search makes available third party content that\nhappens to be of a journalistic nature is not properly regarded\nas processing undertaken &quot;solely&quot; or &quot;only&quot; for journalistic\npurposes, as required by <a href=\"/doc/260256/\" id=\"a_21\">Article 9</a> and s 32. In Google Spain,\nthe Grand Chamber indicated at [85] that it did not consider an\nISE would process solely for journalistic purposes, and although\nthat was not an integral part of the Court&#x27;s reasoning I consider\nit is true. I also accept the argument of Ms Proops, for the ICO\nthat Google&#x27;s approach to the journalism exemption is to be\nresisted because it would have consequences that cannot have\nbeen intended by the legislators. The argument, shortly stated,\nis that the effect of ss 3, 45 and 46 of the DPA is to impose\nsevere constraints on the ICO&#x27;s powers of enforcement where\ndata are processed for the special purposes. If Google&#x27;s\nactivities fall within that description, it would be able to operate\nthe &quot;right to be forgotten regime&quot; without regulatory oversight\nand control. I consider my conclusions to be consistent with the\nstricture contained in <a href=\"/doc/260256/\" id=\"a_22\">Article 9</a> of the DP Directive, that Member\nStates may provide for journalistic exemptions &quot;only if they are\nnecessary to reconcile ... privacy with ... freedom of expression&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_46\">(emphasis added).\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_47\">               ...                   ...                   ...\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_48\">      165. Behind these competing submissions lie some\nobvious difficulties. It is not a simple matter of applying s 4 of\nthe 1974 Act, without regard to other factor or considerations.\nSuch a hard-edged approach would be incompatible with human\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">                               22</span>\n\n\n\nrights jurisprudence, and the fact-sensitive approach that is\nrequired. The argument for the ICO, and the argument with\nwhich Mr Tomlinson ended up, acknowledge as much. The\nCourt&#x27;s task is to interpret and apply the will of Parliament as\nexpressed in a statute passed some 25 years before the advent\nof the internet, to a set of facts of a kind that Parliament cannot\nthen have foreseen; to do so consistently with the will of\nParliament as expressed via the HRA in 1998; and to do so in\nthe light of the fact that it was not until 2004 that the Courts\nidentified the existence of the common law tort of misuse of\nprivate information. The conclusions arrived at then have to be\nfitted into the scheme of the &quot;right to be forgotten&quot;, first\nauthoritatively recognised in a CJEU judgment of 2014 by which\nthis Court is bound, by reason of the 1972 Act.\n</p><pre id=\"pre_2\">      ...                   ...                   ...\n      230. My conclusions are:-\n\n      (1)    The delisting claim is not an abuse of the\n             court&#x27;s process, as alleged by Google.\n\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_49\">       (2)   The inaccuracy complaint is upheld, and an\n             appropriate delisting order will be made, its\n             terms to be the subject of argument.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_50\">       (3)   The remainder of the delisting claim also\n             succeeds.

The Queen&#x27;s Bench declines to accept the contentions of\n\nGoogle for delisting the name of the accused therein. The claim of\n\nthe appellant before the Queen&#x27;s Bench, on an allegation of misuse\n\nof private information succeeded.         The distilled essence of the\n\njudgments rendered by the Apex Court and the judgment of the\n\nDelhi High Court, as also that of the judgment of Queen&#x27;s Bench\n\nall quoted supra would mean that, even an accused who has been\n\ndischarged or acquitted honourably by a competent Court of law\n\nhas a right to live with dignity.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_55\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_56\">      17. <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_23\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India mandates that no\n\nperson shall be deprived of his life or liberty except in accordance\n\nwith law.

In the crime, once the accused\n\ngets acquitted - honourably, discharged by a competent Court of\n\nlaw, or this Court would quash those crimes in exercise of its\n\njurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 482</a> of the Cr.P.C. and those orders\n\nbecome final, the shadow of crime, if permitted to continue in place\n\nof shadow of dignity, on any citizen, it would be travesty of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">                                  24</span>\n\n\n\nconcept of life under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_25\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India. Every\n\ncitizen born in this nation, governed by the Constitution, has a right\n\nto live with dignity.    What is being sought for, is masking of the\n\nname of the petitioner in the cause title of the case found in the\n\nrecords of this Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_57\">      18. In the peculiar facts of the case, no fault can be found\n\nwith such a demand. I deem it appropriate to observe that when\n\nidentical demands are made by those accused or victims, as the\n\ncase would be, accused who come within the circumstances\n\nnarrated hereinbefore, the Fourth Estate should also consider\n\nmasking, delisting and deleting their names from their respective\n\ndigital records and not drive them to this Court seeking such\n\ndeletion. However, it is made clear that mere erasure of the name\n\nof the petitioner in the cause title, does not mean that he is entitled\n\nto seek such erasure from the police records.          The direction\n\nwould be only to enable the internet forget, like the humans\n\nforget.   If it is allowed to stay on record, the internet will\n\nnever permit the humans to forget.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">                                    25</span><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_58\">\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_59\">        19.
