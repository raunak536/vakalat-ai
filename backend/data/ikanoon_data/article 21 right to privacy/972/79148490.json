The High Court, in the judgment impugned before us, taking\n\nnote of the testimony of PW11, who deposed that she had, upon\n\nexamination, found the convict-appellant to have delivered a child\n\nand that the deceased had suffered injuries, convicted the\n\naccused. However, the doctor admits that the death of the child\n\n                         4- [CRIMINAL APPEAL No.1730 OF 2012]\n\fbeing prior to or after the birth remains unmentioned. The same\n\nwas noted to be of no consequence as the injuries recorded on the\n\nbody of the deceased child established the death to be homicidal\n\nin nature. In conclusion, the High Court held that the conviction\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 302</a> IPC was warranted.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\">6.       It is observed that the Courts below, in holding the accused\n\nguilty, primarily relied on the testimonies of eight independent\n\nwitnesses, the testimony of the doctor PW11, and the statement of\n\nthe accused under Section 313 Cr.P.C.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_13\">OUR VIEW\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"193324377\" id=\"span_6\">7.       Awarding the punishment of life imprisonment requires due\n\nappreciation of evidence and cannot be awarded mechanically and\n\nin a perfunctory manner. The law requires that the High Court,\n\nmust, only after re-appreciation of evidence confirm or overturn\n\nthe findings of fact returned by the Trial Court. Recently, this\n\nCourt in <a href=\"/doc/193324377/\" id=\"a_10\">Geeta Devi v. State of U.P.3</a> has succinctly dealt with\n\nthis issue.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_15\">8.       The judgment under challenge, which we are constrained to\n\nobserve, makes only general and sketchy observations, unlike the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">3</span>\n    2022 SCC OnLine 57 (2-Judge Bench)\n                             5- [CRIMINAL APPEAL No.1730 OF 2012]\n\fappreciation of evidence as is required by law, in respect of\n\ntestimonies of the witnesses and other evidence. This approach\n\ncannot be appreciated, especially when the conviction rendered is\n\nfor a serious offence, that is, <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 302</a> IPC. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"193324377\" id=\"span_8\">In <a href=\"/doc/193324377/\" id=\"a_12\">Geeta Devi</a>\n\n(supra), the Court found it fit to remand the matter to the High\n\nCourt for consideration afresh, but in the present case, such\n\ncourse will not be prudent given that this appeal dates back to the\n\nyear 2010. Hence, we proceed to examine the evidence on record.</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_16\">9.   The testimony of Jai Mangal Singh – PW1, who was Sarpanch\n\nat the time of the incident, also reveals that he was informed by a\n\nvillager about the dead body of a newborn child found in the pond\n\nbut did not know to whom it belonged to. Also, he had no\n\nknowledge about the pregnancy of the accused. He did not know\n\nwhen and by whom the child was thrown. In his cross-\n\nexamination, he stated that there were houses belonging to other\n\npeople near the dabri where the dead body was found.\n\nSignificantly, we find none of them stands examined, testifying to\n\nthe presence of the accused near the pond, nor does this witness\n\ntestify to such an effect.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_17\">10. Suraj Kumar Singh - PW2, who saw the dead body of a child\n\nin his dabri, admits the place to be open from all sides, having\n                      6- [CRIMINAL APPEAL No.1730 OF 2012]\n\faccess by all. He further deposes that he did not see any woman,\n\nmuch less the accused, throw the child.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\">11. Rambaran Singh - PW3, who was informed by PW2 of the\n\ndead body of a child lying in the dabri, admits having no knowledge\n\nas to whom the child belonged to. His testimony reveals the reason\n\nfor suspicion and doubting the accused, for she being the only one\n\nwithout a husband.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_19\">12. Smt. Sumitra - PW4, in her testimony, only discloses the\n\nfactum of the accused being pregnant. The testimonies of PW5 and\n\nPW6 are also to similar effect.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_20\">13. Similarly, though, Smt. Rambai - PW7 denies any knowledge\n\nof the accused being pregnant but only adds that the accused&#x27;s\n\nbody looked as though she had just delivered a child. However, the\n\nlatter part is denied by PW8.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_21\">14. The testimony of the Investigating Officer - PW10 is only to\n\nthe effect of spot verification and conduct of procedural formalities.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_22\">15. PW11 is the Medical Officer who examined the child&#x27;s dead\n\nbody and the accused person. She gave her opinion that the child\n\nwas delivered prematurely, i.e., prior to 9 months. She also stated\n\nthat the child died within 45 to 50 hours of the medical\n\n                      7- [CRIMINAL APPEAL No.1730 OF 2012]\n\fexamination, and its death was homicidal in nature. On\n\nexamination, she found the accused to be physically weak. She\n\nadmitted not to have mentioned as to whether the child had died\n\nbefore or after birth. She did not even mention if the child belonged\n\nto the accused person.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_23\">16. Thus, none of these witnesses could prove, much less beyond\n\na reasonable doubt, the prosecution case of the accused having\n\nthrown the child in the dabri after delivery or having caused the\n\ndeath.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_24\">17. In her defense, the convict-appellant categorically denied the\n\naccusation of having killed any child, much less the child in\n\nquestion. She states that Baiga Gond, who had fathered the child\n\nshe was carrying, in an endeavor to get rid of the child, forcibly\n\ntried to have her take some medicine. He pushed her into &#x27;Suraj ki\n\ndabri&#x27; on her refusal, leading to her miscarriage. The further\n\ndefence set up by her was that she had not killed the child and\n\nwas being falsely implicated.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_25\">18. A perusal of the statement of the convict-appellant gives rise\n\nto the question as to whether she had admitted her guilt? Whether\n\nupon such a statement, the onus on the prosecution stood shifted?\n\nWhether it could be said that the convict-appellant was obliged to\n                      8- [CRIMINAL APPEAL No.1730 OF 2012]\n\fdisclose her pregnancy, if so, and what became of such child that\n\nshe was allegedly carrying?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_26\">19. Further, what must be considered is whether the convict-\n\nappellant has no right of privacy of not disclosing the prosecution\n\nor the Court as to what happened to her child which she was\n\ncarrying in her womb, particularly when the prosecution failed to\n\ndischarge the initial burden and onus of establishing the deceased,\n\nin any manner to be related to the accused?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_27\">20. Is not, inherent in a lady the right of confidentiality and\n\nprivacy in matters concerning her personal life, of not disclosing\n\nany circumstances, as may be required by law?\n\nLAW ON PRIVACY\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_28\">21. In searching for answers to the questions above, it is pertinent\n\nfor us to intervene when structures of injustice and persecution\n\ndeeply entrenched in patriarchy are destructive of constitutional\n\nfreedom.4 The right to privacy is the underpinning of human\n\ndignity and is fundamental to the realization of human rights.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_29\">22.

The importance of this right was underscored by U.S.\n\nSupreme Court as far as the year 19585 by quoting William Pitt,\n\nEarl of Chatham:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">               “The poorest man may in his cottage bid defiance to all\n              the force of the Crown.

In K.S. Puttaswamy (Privacy-9J.) v. Union of India,6 this\n\nCourt, speaking through Dr. D.Y. Chandrachud, J. (as the learned\n\nChief Justice then was) while discussing the essential nature of\n\nprivacy observed:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">              “297. What, then, does privacy postulate? Privacy\n              postulates the reservation of a private space for the\n              individual, described as the right to be let alone. The\n              concept is founded on the autonomy of the individual.\n              The ability of an individual to make choices lies at the\n              core of the human personality. The notion of privacy\n              enables the individual to assert and control the human\n              element which is inseparable from the personality of the\n              individual. The inviolable nature of the human\n              personality is manifested in the ability to make\n              decisions on matters intimate to human life. The\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">5</span>\n Miller v United States 357 U.<a href=\"/doc/1233988/\" id=\"a_14\">S. 301(1958)</a>\n<a href=\"/doc/1633827/\" id=\"a_15\">6 (2017)</a> <a href=\"/doc/1980183/\" id=\"a_16\">10</a> SCC 1\n                            10- [CRIMINAL APPEAL No.1730 OF 2012]\n\fautonomy of the individual is associated over matters\nwhich can be kept private. These are concerns over\nwhich there is a legitimate expectation of privacy. The\nbody and the mind are inseparable elements of the\nhuman personality. The integrity of the body and the\nsanctity of the mind can exist on the foundation\nthat each individual possesses an inalienable ability\nand right to preserve a private space in which the\nhuman personality can develop. Without the ability to\nmake choices, the inviolability of the personality would\nbe in doubt. Recognising a zone of privacy is but an\nacknowledgment that each individual must be entitled\nto chart and pursue the course of development of\npersonality. Hence privacy is a postulate of human\ndignity itself. Thoughts and behavioural patterns which\nare intimate to an individual are entitled to a zone of\nprivacy where one is free of social expectations. In that\nzone of privacy, an individual is not judged by others.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_32\">Privacy enables each individual to take crucial decisions\nwhich find expression in the human personality. It\nenables individuals to preserve their beliefs, thoughts,\nexpressions, ideas, ideologies, preferences and choices\nagainst societal demands of homogeneity. Privacy is an\nintrinsic recognition of heterogeneity, of the right of the\nindividual to be different and to stand against the tide\nof conformity in creating a zone of solitude. Privacy\nprotects the individual from the searching glare of\npublicity in matters which are personal to his or her life.\nPrivacy attaches to the person and not to the place\nwhere it is associated. Privacy constitutes the\nfoundation of all liberty because it is in privacy that\nthe individual can decide how liberty is best\nexercised. Individual dignity and privacy are\ninextricably linked in a pattern woven out of a\nthread of diversity into the fabric of a plural culture.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_33\">298. Privacy of the individual is an essential aspect of\ndignity. Dignity has both an intrinsic and instrumental\nvalue. As an intrinsic value, human dignity is an\nentitlement or a constitutionally protected interest in\nitself. In its instrumental facet, dignity and freedom are\ninseparably intertwined, each being a facilitative tool to\nachieve the other. The ability of the individual to protect\na zone of privacy enables the realisation of the full value\nof life and liberty. Liberty has a broader meaning of\nwhich privacy is a subset. All liberties may not be\nexercised in privacy. Yet others can be fulfilled only\nwithin a private space. Privacy enables the individual\n\n            11- [CRIMINAL APPEAL No.1730 OF 2012]\n\f                 to retain the autonomy of the body and mind. The\n                 autonomy of the individual is the ability to make\n                 decisions on vital matters of concern to life. Privacy\n                 has not been couched as an independent fundamental\n                 right. But that does not detract from the constitutional\n                 protection afforded to it, once the true nature of privacy\n                 and its relationship with those fundamental rights\n                 which are expressly protected is understood. Privacy lies\n                 across the spectrum of protected freedoms. …The\n                 intersection between one&#x27;s mental integrity and privacy\n                 entitles the individual to freedom of thought, the\n                 freedom to believe in what is right, and the freedom of\n                 self-determination. When these guarantees intersect\n                 with gender, they create a private space which protects\n                 all those elements which are crucial to gender identity.\n                 The family, marriage, procreation and sexual\n                 orientation are all integral to the dignity of the\n                 individual… The freedoms under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_17\">Article 19</a> can be\n                 fulfilled where the individual is entitled to decide upon\n                 his or her preferences. ... Dignity cannot exist without\n                 privacy.
