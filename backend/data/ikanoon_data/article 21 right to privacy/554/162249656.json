He states that after the Defendant No.1 published the Impugned Quote\n                                   Tweet, the Plaintiff had published Suppressed Tweet No.2 in response\n                                   thereto, wherein she had for the first time raised the issue of violation of\n                                   privacy rights.

He states that firstly,\n                                   the staring 22 second of the impugned video was telecasted live, and\n                                   secondly, there is no material placed by the Plaintiff on record to show that\n                                   the impugned video is doctored. He states that Plaintiff has herself relied\n                                   upon the said video and its screenshot to substantiate her arguments,\n                                   therefore, if the impugned video is doctored the claim of the Plaintiff has to\n                                   fall which is made on the basis of the said impugned video.\n                                   9.4.   He states that in the impugned video it can be seen that the Plaintiff is\n                                   abusing the Defendant No.12 and has forced him to get out of her house. He\n                                   states that the Plaintiff in the plaint and in the captioned application has not\n                                   pleaded anything with respect to that part of impugned video where the\n                                   Plaintiff can be seen misbehaving with the Defendant No.12, who was just\n                                   doing his duty. He states that in the plaint the Plaintiff has nowhere\n                                   mentioned that she had moved the camera or even touched the camera or the\n                                   cameraperson i.e., Defendant No.12, but on being pointed out during the\n                                   course of hearing, there has been a summersault in the said stand as can be\n                                   seen in the written submission of the Plaintiff wherein she stated that she\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">Signature Not Verified             CS(OS) 632/2024</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">Signed By:HEMANT PRATAP</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">SINGH                                                                                                          Page 11 of 42</span>\n\nSigning Date:04.04.2025 13:15:10\n                                    had moved the camera just once.

He states that the grant of interim injunction as sought for by the\n                                   Plaintiff cannot be in nature of a final relief or mandatory injunction as the\n                                   same if granted would amount to a final decree.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_43\">                                   9.6.

It is also admitted that the Defendant No.12\n                                   had placed the camera after taking due consent from the Plaintiff and\n                                   therefore, the Plaintiff waived off her rights if any to claim defence of\n                                   privacy right being violated.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_44\">                                   9.7.       He states that once the use of video was consented, the manner of\n                                   using the said video was entirely the discretion of the Defendants and the\n                                   same cannot be dictated by the Plaintiff. (Re: Martin v. Senators, Inc.7).\n                                   He further states that the right of privacy does not exist where a person has\n                                   consented and further that an individual cannot claim right to privacy with\n                                   regard to subject matter which cannot from the very nature of things remain\n                                   private.

He states that in-fact the Defendant No.1 has\n                                   not even taken views of Defendant No.12 before publishing the said video.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_45\">                                   (iv)        Plaintiff&#x27;s response to the non-disclosure of Suppressed Tweet Nos. 1 and 2\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_46\">                                   10.

But it is obvious that the subject-matter of an action for\n                                             defamation is so special as to require exceptional caution in\n                                             exercising the jurisdiction to interfere by injunction before the\n                                             trial of an action to prevent an anticipated wrong. The right of\n                                             free speech is one which it is for the public interest that\n                                             individuals should possess, and, indeed, that they should exercise\n                                             without impediment, so long as no wrongful act is done; and,\n                                             unless an alleged libel is untrue, there is no wrong committed;\n                                             but, on the contrary, often a very wholesome act is performed in\n                                             the publication and repetition of an alleged libel.

The Court will not restrain the\n                                             publication of an article, even though it is defamatory, when the\n                                             defendant says he intends to justify it or to make fair comment on\n                                             a matter of public interest. That has been established for many\n                                             years ever since (Bonnard v. Perryman [Bonnard v.

The reason sometimes given is that the\n                                             defences of justification and fair comment are for the jury, which\n                                             is the constitutional tribunal, and not for a Judge. But a better\n                                             reason is the importance in the public interest that the truth\n                                             should out. ...&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_63\">                                                                                       (Emphasis supplied)\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_64\">                                   13.

The Defendant Nos. 1 and 2 have contended that video footage of 40\n                                   seconds which was recorded after the Plaintiff withdrew from the live debate\n                                   was due to a technical lag and not deliberate.

Therefore, the first issue arising for consideration on the basis of the\n                                   defence of Defendant Nos. 1 and 2 is that, &#x27;whether the Plaintiff had waived\n                                   all her rights to privacy vis-à-vis the impugned video (more specifically the\n                                   first part of 40 seconds forming part of Video No.3) recorded in the privacy\n                                   of her home and as uploaded with the Impugned Quote Tweet ?\n                                   19.1. Admittedly the Plaintiff had consented to participating in the live\n                                   debate hosted by Defendant No. 1 on the platform of Defendant No. 2 on a\n                                   current affairs issue. The Plaintiff had joined the live debate virtually from\n                                   her home and had consented to the video recording of her views on the topic\n                                   of the live debate. It is a matter of record that due to a difference of opinion\n                                   with the host Defendant No. 1, the Plaintiff elected to withdraw from the\n                                   live debate midway, which was not objected to by Defendant No. 1 and he in\n                                   fact, fairly observed on the National Television that Plaintiff is at liberty to\n                                   withdraw from the debate. [This can be seen in the video footage of the\n                                   televised live debate placed before this Court as Video No. 1].\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_78\">                                   11</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_87\">                                        Para 2 (xii) in Defendant No. 1&#x27;s Reply to I.A.

A perusal of Video No. 1 as seen on National Television shows that\n                                   when the Plaintiff withdrew from the live debate, she first removed the\n                                   microphone and the patch and thereafter, rose from her chair and walked\n                                   away from the shooting frame; all of which was visible in the televised live\n                                   debate. These actions are also captured in the first 22 seconds of impugned\n                                   video, which video was recorded at Plaintiff No. 1&#x27;s residence. To this\n                                   extent, this Court finds merit in the submission of Defendant Nos. 1 and 2\n                                   that the Plaintiff had waived privacy rights vis-à-vis the first 22 seconds of\n                                   the Video No.3 as she did not instruct Defendant No. 12 to stop recording\n                                   her before she started removing her microphone. The live telecast of first 22\n                                   seconds of the impugned video was known to the Plaintiff at the\n                                   contemporaneous time and she did not raise any objections to this effect in\n                                   her Suppressed Tweet No. 1 which was published on 26.07.2024 at 10:21\n                                   P.M., immediately after she exited from the live debate.\n                                   19.3. In this regard, this Court observes that the allegations of the Plaintiff12\n                                   that the video recording of her removing her microphone (as seen in the first\n                                   22 seconds of the impugned video) outrages her modesty also does not\n                                   prima facie appeal to this Court. When Video No. 1 of the live debate is seen\n                                   in continuity and as a whole, it is observed that Plaintiff carefully proceeded\n                                   to remove the microphone having decided to withdraw from the live debate.\n                                   There is no discomfort visible on the Plaintiff&#x27;s face, as alleged in the plaint.\n                                   In fact, the Plaintiff can be seen removing the microphone efficiently and\n                                   walk away from the chair in which she was seated. More importantly, the\n                                   televised live debate was also being viewed by the Plaintiff on the TV screen\n                                   in her room at her residence (as also admitted by the Plaintiff in the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_82\">                                   12</span>\n                                        At paragraph 3.6 of the plaint.\n</p>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_83\">Signature Not Verified             CS(OS) 632/2024</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_84\">Signed By:HEMANT PRATAP</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_85\">SINGH                                                                                                        Page 23 of 42</span>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_88\">Signing Date:04.04.2025 13:15:10\n                                    Suppressed Tweet No.2) and therefore, she could see that her action of\n                                   removal of her microphone has been captured on the live debate and\n                                   Plaintiff did not raise any objection at the contemporaneous time on this\n                                   recording of unmiking in the Suppressed Tweet No.1.\n                                   19.4. If the Plaintiff, did not want the removal of the microphone to be\n                                   recorded, she should have first asked Defendant No. 12 to stop recording\n                                   her, confirm the stoppage of recording and then proceeded to remove her\n                                   microphone. In the facts of this case, Plaintiff did not do any of the above;\n                                   however, once she decided to withdraw from the live debate, she unmiked\n                                   herself while still being seen on National Television and walked away from\n                                   the shooting frame.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_89\">                                   19.5. Thus, the Plaintiff&#x27;s allegations pertaining to the video recording of\n                                   her removing the microphone, allegedly outraging her modesty or violating\n                                   her privacy appears is misconceived and appears to be an afterthought.\n                                   Next 18 seconds of the impugned video\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_90\">                                   20.

Upon careful examination of the next 18 seconds of the impugned\n                                   video, it is evident that various parts of the Plaintiff&#x27;s residence, including\n                                   her bedroom, are visible in this footage. Additionally, while the Plaintiff was\n                                   participating in the live debate, her hair was styled and left open.

Therefore, a thin difference has been put forth\n                                               regarding the private life of a public official and the public duties of\n                                               the public official.

In the second part of the text portion of the Impugned Quote Tweet\n                                   there are four (4) comments vis-à-vis Plaintiff solely based on the impugned\n                                   video; (i) chuck the mike; (ii) abuse our video journalist; (iii) throw him out\n                                   of your house; and (iv) no excuse for bad behaviour.\n                                   22.3. As noted above Defendant No.1 admits that these comments are not\n                                   based on corroboration of Defendant No. 12 but solely on the basis of the\n                                   opinion formed by Defendant No.1 and PCR of Defendant No. 2 after\n                                   viewing the impugned video. This Court will deal with each of the said\n                                   comment, objected to in the plaint and the captioned application, to see\n                                   whether they are covered by the defence of truth or not.\n                                   &#x27;Chuck the mike&#x27; and &#x27;throw him out of your house&#x27;\n                                   22.4. This Court has viewed Video No. 3, which has been relied upon by\n                                   Defendant Nos. 1 and 2 and also Video No.1 for further clarity. As\n                                   previously noted in this judgment, a careful examination of the said videos\n                                   reveals that the Plaintiff removed the mike efficiently and the patch attached\n                                   to it, and subsequently rose from her chair, placing the microphone on the\n                                   table in front of her. The microphone however fell due to the entanglement\n                                   with the cord. It is therefore, clear on a bare perusal of the video footages\n                                   that by no reasonable interpretation, can it be claimed that the mike was\n                                   &#x27;chucked&#x27; by the Plaintiff. Therefore, the comment chuck the mike cannot be\n                                   said to be substantially correct as it is without any basis and contrary to the\n                                   video footages; not affording this comment, the protection of defence of\n                                   truth as contended/relied upon by Defendant No. 1.\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_126\">Signature Not Verified             CS(OS) 632/2024</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_127\">Signed By:HEMANT PRATAP</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_128\">SINGH                                                                                                        Page 32 of 42</span>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_115\">Signing Date:04.04.2025 13:15:10\n                                    22.5. Insofar as protection of defence of truth qua the comment throw him\n                                   out of your house is concerned it has been examined on the basis of the\n                                   impugned video and the reply filed by Defendant No. 12 to the captioned\n                                   application. This is for the reason that Defendant No. 1 admits that he had\n                                   not verified the facts from Defendant No. 12 before posting the Impugned\n                                   Quote Tweet and had relied solely upon the impression formed by him after\n                                   viewing the impugned video. The part of impugned video of 18 seconds\n                                   certainly shows the Plaintiff aggressively demanding Defendant No. 12 to\n                                   leave her house and the words used while so directing are certainly not\n                                   polite or cordial. Admittedly, it is not the case of Defendant No. 12 in his\n                                   reply to this application that he was physically escorted out or pushed out\n                                   from Plaintiff&#x27;s apartment. However, Defendant No. 1&#x27;s comment that\n                                   Plaintiff threw the Defendant No. 12 out of her house is bound to give an\n                                   impression to the ordinary reader on reading the comment with the\n                                   impugned video as though, Plaintiff physically pushed out Defendant No. 12\n                                   from the apartment; which is factually inaccurate and not even made out\n                                   from viewing the 18 seconds video footage.

Furthermore, when the phrases chuck the mike and throw him out of\n                                   your house is evaluated in the context of Defendant No. 1&#x27;s assertion in his\n                                   reply, wherein he stated that the Impugned Quote Tweet was published to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_129\">Signature Not Verified             CS(OS) 632/2024</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_130\">Signed By:HEMANT PRATAP</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_131\">SINGH                                                                                                       Page 33 of 42</span>\n\nSigning Date:04.04.2025 13:15:10\n                                    present the Plaintiff&#x27;s true image vis-à-vis her character to the public, it can\n                                   be reasonably concluded that the comment chuck the mike and throw him out\n                                   of your house is an overstatement, intended to create a sensationalized\n                                   narrative, which in fact had an intended effect because various news\n                                   agencies published and reported the Impugned Quote Tweet as a fact to its\n                                   readers/viewers.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_118\">                                   22.7. In the present case, the text of the Impugned Quote Tweet uses a\n                                   powerful expression, which when the ordinary reader of the tweet would\n                                   read is bound to influence his/her mind before he/she plays the attached\n                                   impugned video. The comments in the Impugned Quote Tweet would create\n                                   a perspective with which the reader would view the impugned video. Since,\n                                   &#x27;X&#x27; is a conversational medium and the reader would spend limited time\n                                   viewing the comment and the video, the impression formed on the basis of\n                                   the comment and video would be instantaneous. Since Defendant No. 1 is a\n                                   reputed Journalist with large number of followers, the tendency of the reader\n                                   to believe the accuracy of the comment posted by Defendant No. 1 would be\n                                   higher. Moreover, in the facts of this case, since Defendant No. 1 in the\n                                   Impugned Quote Tweet has asserted that he is commenting about the\n                                   conduct of Plaintiff vis-à-vis Defendant No.2&#x27;s cameraman (Defendant No.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_119\">                                   12), the reader would further assume that Defendant No. 1 had verified the\n                                   said fact. Thus, the impact of Defendant No. 1&#x27;s Impugned Quote Tweet is\n                                   certainly significant as is evident from the rapid traction that this comment\n                                   got with other news agencies. For instance, Defendant No. 10 has posted a\n                                   comment alleging that Plaintiff attacked Defendant No. 12, which comment\n                                   is clearly not made out in the facts of this case. However, this Court having\n                                   viewed the impugned video and having perused the affidavit of Defendant\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_132\">Signature Not Verified             CS(OS) 632/2024</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_133\">Signed By:HEMANT PRATAP</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_134\">SINGH                                                                                                       Page 34 of 42</span>\n\nSigning Date:04.04.2025 13:15:10\n                                    No. 12 finds that Defendant No. 1 did not have a reasonable basis for\n                                   making these impugned comments i.e., &#x27;chuck the mike&#x27; and &#x27;throw him out\n                                   of your house&#x27;.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_120\">                                   &#x27;Abuse our video journalist&#x27; and &#x27;no excuse for bad behaviour&#x27;\n                                   22.8.

It has been pleaded by\n                                   Defendant No. 1 in its reply that after the live debate concluded, he was\n                                   shown the impugned video by the PCR of Defendant No. 2 and he was\n                                   asked to do something about the misbehaviour and abuses hurled by the\n                                   Plaintiff on Defendant No. 12. Defendant No. 1 has further contended that\n                                   after perusing the Suppressed Tweet No. 1 he posted the Impugned Quote\n                                   Tweet to set the record straight and also highlight the conduct of Plaintiff\n                                   vis-à-vis Defendant No. 12.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_125\">                                   23.2.

They published impugned articles carrying the\n                                   Impugned Quote Tweet and impugned video and reported it as &#x27;facts&#x27;. These\n                                   articles would certainly be governed by journalistic norms cited by Plaintiff\n                                   and Defendant nos. 1 and 2; and these Defendants (nos. 6 to 9) would\n                                   certainly be obliged to carry out verification from Plaintiff and Defendant\n                                   No. 12 before reposting the Impugned Quote Tweet and impugned video.\n                                   23.4. In this regard, this Court finds that the Plaintiff has rightly relied upon\n                                   the Norms of Journalistic Conduct published by Press Council of India\n                                   which requires the journalist to verify the story from the concerned parties\n                                   before reporting on the same. In the facts of this case, Plaintiff has asserted\n                                   that no such verification was carried out by the said Defendant Nos. 6 to 9.\n                                   Moreover, the impugned video placed in public domain by Defendant Nos. 1\n                                   and 2 without the consent of the Plaintiff is liable to be removed by other\n                                   Defendants as well. Therefore, Defendant No.6 to 9 are directed to take\n                                   down impugned video and/or the article published on the basis of the said\n                                   impugned video.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_127\">                                   Qua Defendant No.10\n                                   23.5.

It is stated that\n                                   impugned video was doctored and published with the intent of putting the\n                                   Plaintiff in bad light and to defame her. In this regards it would be relevant\n                                   to refer to the post script filed by the IT Local Commissioner along with the\n                                   main report of the Local Commissioners. In the said post script, the IT Local\n                                   Commissioner has highlighted three (3) probable doubts with respect to the\n                                   impugned video and has subsequently answered all three (3) of them.
