The plaintiff by this application seeks a direction to the first defendant to furnish blood\nsamples for enabling the DNA testing.\n\n2.     Briefly, the facts are that the plaintiff claims a decree for declaration that the first\ndefendant is his biological father. The second defendant (hereafter referred to as Ujjawala\nSharma) is the plaintiff‟s mother. Apparently, he (first defendant) was a Member of Parliament\nduring the period 1967-1980. It is contended that Ujjawala Sharma was active in politics and\n\nIA No.4720/2008 in CS(OS) No. 700/2008                                                      Page 1\n involved in activities of All India Young Woman Congress apart from her job as Sanskrit\nLecturer at Daulat Ram College. The plaintiff also contends that Ujjawala Sharma was\npreviously married to Sh. B.P. Sharma from whom she was estranged. Apparently, she and her\nhusband Sh. B.P. Sharma had a son Siddhartha Sharma. The plaintiff contends that the first\ndefendant did not have any child from his marriage, and, as he was very fond of Ujjawala\nSharma and even wanted to marry her, he convinced her to have his child promising that he\nwould divorce his wife and give his name to the child to be borne by her (i.e. Ujjawala Sharma).\nThe plaintiff submits that believing the first defendant and due to his emotional pressure,\nUjjawala Sharma yielded to his request and the plaintiff was born on 15.02.1979. It is contended\nthat the first defendant showed interest in the plaintiff as father right from the beginning and\nused, to sometime, stay with him in the house of his maternal grandfather or wherever the\nplaintiff and Ujjawala Sharma resided.\n3.     The suit averments allege that the first defendant used to celebrate all important festivals\nand the plaintiff‟s birthday together, with him, and that he, i.e. (the plaintiff was) told by his\nmother and his maternal grandparents, as well as well wishers that the first defendant would\nadopt him. It is stated that in the records, plaintiff‟s father name was disclosed as B.P. Sharma\nbut around the time when he became 12/13 years, he was made aware of the circumstances of his\nbirth and that he was the biological son of the first defendant. The plaintiff claims that the first\ndefendant was active in politics and that his relationship with him (i.e. the plaintiff) was in the\npublic knowledge. With passage of time, , the first defendant gained prominence in his political\ncareer and started taking less interest in his (the plaintiff‟s) life, even though he maintained some\nrelationship. In 1995, the plaintiff suffered a blow when the first defendant refused to meet\nUjjawala Sharma and instructed his staff that she should not be allowed to enter the house. The\nplaintiff felt this rejection difficult to understand, as it was a big blow to his self-esteem since he\nwas of an impressionable age, i.e. 16 years. It is alleged that the first defendant‟s men used to\ngive the plaintiff threatening calls. The suit alleges that in 2001 when the plaintiff tried to meet\nthe first defendant in Delhi with Ujjawala Sharma, he was rebuffed and manhandled by the first\ndefendant‟s guards.\n4.     The suit alleges that when the first defendant became the Chief Minister of Uttaranchal in\n2002, perhaps with a view to avoid unpleasantness, he agreed to meet the plaintiff occasionally.\nAllegedly, this went on for a while after which the first defendant again refused to meet or have\n\n\nIA No.4720/2008 in CS(OS) No. 700/2008                                                          Page 2\n anything to do with the plaintiff. The suit alleges that between 2002 and 2005, a record of the\nmeeting with the first defendant was maintained through photographs of the functions attended\nby the parties. It is alleged that thereafter, i.e. after 2005, the first defendant has stopped meeting\nthe plaintiff due to which he has suffered grave mental trauma and finds it unable to bear the\ninjustice done to him. The plaintiff submits that the inhuman conduct of the first defendant is\nhurting, as a result of which he filed a suit being No.1711/2007. It is submitted that at that time\nthe first defendant was holding the position of Governor of Andhra Pradesh and the suit was\nwithdrawn as disclosing a technical defect on 24.3.2005 with liberty to file a fresh suit. In these\ncircumstances, he has filed the suit, claiming declaration of paternity.\n5.     The plaintiff urges that it is necessary and in the interest of justice that the blood samples\nof the first defendant should be obtained, for which the Court should issue an appropriate\ndirection to the latter. The plaintiff urges that such a direction is necessitated on account of the\nDNA test report received from the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Hyderabad, to\nwhich the plaintiff‟s blood samples and that of Sh. B.P. Sharma, (shown in the records as his\nfather), were submitted. The plaintiff states that the report of the said DNA report\nunambiguously reflects that Sh. B.P. Sharma cannot be his (i.e. the plaintiff‟s) biological father.\nThe plaintiff besides relying on the report, a copy of which is on the record, also relies upon a\njoint affidavit by himself and the said Sh. B.P. Sharma stating that such blood samples were\nfurnished voluntarily; he also relies upon copies of several photographs filed along with the suit\nand even subsequently. In support of the submission that Ujjawala Sharma and B.P. Sharma\nwere estranged and subsequently their marriage was dissolved, reliance is placed upon the\npleadings in the divorce proceedings. It is submitted that the said Court document established\nthat the husband and wife were estranged and living separately since 1970.\n6.     The plaintiff submits that the Court has power under <a href=\"/doc/69984823/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 75 (e)</a> of the Code of Civil\nProcedure (<a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_2\">CPC</a>) read with Order-XXVI, Rule-10 (A) to issue a direction for holding a scientific\ntechnical or expert investigation. It is argued that the Supreme Court had in Goutam Kundu v.\nState of West Bengal &amp; Anr., (1993) 3 SCC 418 even while sounding a note of caution with\nregard to a court‟s approach in deciding such applications, had summarized the legal position in\nthe following manner: -\n       &quot;26. From      the              above    discussion  it                 emerges:-\n       (1) that courts in          India cannot order blood test              as matter\n       of course;\n\nIA No.4720/2008 in CS(OS) No. 700/2008                                                          Page 3\n        (2) wherever applications are made for such prayers                           in\n       order to have roving inquiry, the prayer for blood                          test\n       cannot be entertained.\n       (3) There must be a strong prima facie case in that                          the\n       husband must establish non access in order to dispel                         the\n       presumption arising under <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_3\">section 112</a> of the Evidence Act.\n       (4) The court must carefully examine as to what would                        be\n       the consequence of ordering the blood test; whether it                      will\n       have the effect of branding a child as a bastard and                        the\n       mother as an unchaste woman.\n       (5) No one can be compelled to give sample of blood                          for\n       analysis.&quot;\n\n7.     The plaintiff argues that the correct legal position was, however, restated and clarified by\na subsequent larger - 3 Judges Bench ruling reported as Sharda v. Dharmpal, AIR 2003 SC\n3450. In the said judgment, the Court held as follows: -\n       &quot;39. Goutam Kundu (supra) is, therefore, not an authority for the\n       proposition that under no circumstances the Court can direct that blood tests\n       be conducted. It, having regard to the future of the child, has, of course,\n       sounded a note of caution as regard mechanical passing of such order. In\n       some other jurisdictions, it has been held that such directions should\n       ordinarily be made if it is in the interest of the child.\n\n       XXX                                   XXX                               XXX\n\n       80. The matter may be considered from another angle. In all such\n       matrimonial cases where divorce is sought, say on the ground of impotency,\n       schizophrenia...etc. normally without there being medical examination, it\n       would be difficult to arrive at a conclusion as to whether the allegation made\n       by his spouse against the other spouses seeking divorce on such a ground, is\n       correct or not. In order to substantiate such allegation, the petitioner would\n       always insist on medical examination. If respondent avoids such medical</pre>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_1\">       examination on the ground that it violates his/her right to privacy or for a\n       matter right to personal liberty as enshrined under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_4\">Article 21</a> of the\n       Constitution of India, then it may in most of such cases become impossible to\n       arrive at a conclusion. It may render the very grounds on which divorce is\n       permissible nugatory. Therefore, when there is no right to privacy specifically\n       conferred by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_5\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India and with the extensive\n       interpretation of the phrase &quot;personal liberty&quot; this right has been read into\n       <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_6\">Article 21</a>, it cannot be treated as absolute right. What is emphasized is that\n       some limitations on this right have to be imposed and particularly where two\n       competing interests clash. In mattes of aforesaid nature where the legislature\n       has conferred a right upon his spouse to seek divorce on such grounds, it\n       would be the right of that spouse which comes in conflict with the so-called\n\nIA No.4720/2008 in CS(OS) No. 700/2008                                                      Page 4\n        right to privacy of the respondent. Thus the Court has to reconcile these\n       competing interests by balancing the interests involved.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_2\">8.     The first defendant relies upon the written statement, which has denied the suit\naverments. It is submitted that the suit is not maintainable since the effect of the relief claimed is\nthat he should be declared as a legitimate son of the first defendant. The first defendant relies\nupon <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 112</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/750738/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 4</a> of the Indian Evidence Act and submits that the Court\ncannot ascertain the truth or otherwise of the paternity allegations since a valid marriage\nsubsisted between Ujjawala Sharma and B.P. Sharma.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_3\">9.     The first defendant claims that the suit is the result of a deep rooted criminal conspiracy\nand to defame, tarnish his image and to harm his reputation as a public figure and that it is also a\ntool used with the sinister design of grabbing his property. The first defendant argues that the\ncorrect legal position is that the birth of a child during the subsistence of a valid marriage\nbetween his parents is conclusive proof of legitimacy unless it is shown that the parties to the\nmarriage had no access to each other at any time when the child had been begotten. It is\nemphasized that the Court cannot allow any evidence to be led for the purpose of disproving\nsuch conclusive proof except to the extent of lack of access.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_4\">10.    In response to the application for direction to the first defendant to give blood samples, it\nis urged that the application is pre-mature since the Court would evaluate the evidence and\nmaterials at the stage of trial and then if the occasion so warrants consider and weigh the\nnecessity of issuing such directions. However, at this stage, the Court cannot pre-judge on the\nbasis of this scanty material and conclude that a direction sought for ought to be given.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_5\">11.    The first defendant argues that the materials on record in any event nowhere substantiate\nthe plaintiff‟s allegation inasmuch as the matrimonial/divorce proceedings, as between the\nUjjawala Sharma and her former husband B.P. Sharma, were instituted only in 2006. Even the\ntwo applications filed by the parties before the Court which dissolved their marriage disclosed\nthat they lived in the same building although it was shown that one lived on the first floor and the\nother spouse on the ground floor. Prima facie, this supported the case of access for the period\n1978-2006 rather than otherwise. In these circumstances, without admitting the soundness of the\nplaintiff‟s legal contentions - argues the first defendant - there is in fact no prima facie case made\nout for the direction sought by the applicant.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_6\">IA No.4720/2008 in CS(OS) No. 700/2008                                                         Page 5\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_7\"> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"505918\" id=\"span_1\">12.    It is argued that the authorities on the effect of <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_9\">Section-112</a> are uniform, from the\ndecision in Goutam Kundu onwards. Reliance in this context is placed upon the judgment\nreported as <a href=\"/doc/505918/\" id=\"a_10\">Banarsi Dass v. Mrs. Teeku Dutta and Anr.</a>, (2005) 4 SCC 449.         In that case, the\nSupreme Court relied upon previous decision and held in the following terms: -</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_8\">         &quot;13. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"503124\" id=\"span_2\">In <a href=\"/doc/503124/\" id=\"a_11\">Dukhtar Jahan (Smt.) v. Mohammed Farooq</a>: 1987 Cri LJ 849 this\n         Court held:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">         ...<a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 112</a> lays down that if a person was born during the continuance of\n         a valid marriage between his mother and any man or within two hundred\n         and eighty days after its dissolution and the mother remains unmarried, it\n         shall be taken as conclusive proof that he is the legitimate son of that man,\n         unless it can be shown that the parties to the marriage had no access to\n         each other at any time when he could have been begotten. This rule of law\n         based on the dictates of justice has always made the courts incline towards\n         upholding the legitimacy of a child unless the facts are so compulsive and\n         clinching as to necessarily warrant a finding that the child could not at all\n         have been begotten to the father and as such a legitimation of the 1089 child\n         would result in rank injustice to the father. Courts have always desisted\n         from lightly or hastily rendering a verdict and that too, on the basis of\n         slender materials, which will have the effect of branding a child as a\n         bastard and its mother an unchaste woman.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">              XXX                             XXX                         XXX\n\n         In order to succeed in the succession application the applicant has to\n         adduce cogent and credible evidence in support of the application. The\n         respondents, if they so choose, can also adduce evidence to oppose the grant\n         of succession certificate. The trial court erroneously held that the\n         documents produced by the respondents were not sufficient or relevant for\n         the purpose of adjudication and DNA test was conclusive. This is not a\n         correct view. It is for the parties to place evidence in support of their\n         respective claims and establish their stands. DNA test is not to be directed\n         as a matter of routine and only in deserving cases such a direction can be\n         given, as was noted in Goutam Kundu‟s case (supra). Present case does not\n         fall to that category. High Court‟s judgment does not suffer from any\n         infirmity. We, therefore, uphold it.

The said 13 outlet is, if it can be shown\n              that the parties had no access to each other at the time when the\n              child could have been begotten the presumption could be rebutted.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\">         21.

Durgi\n         during the continuance of her marriage with the deceased Balak Ram.\n         Therefore, in the absence of cogent and reliable evidence as to non-access\n         on the part of the deceased Balak Ram, presumption under <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 112</a> of\n         the Indian Evidence Act would be available and it will have to be held that\n         plaintiff and defendants are sons of deceased Balak Ram.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_12\">         22. On ground of public policy, it is undesirable to enquire into the paternity\n         of a child whose parents &quot;have access&quot; to each other.

In that case, the\nSupreme Court considered the previous ruling in Sharda‟s case in the context of a submission\nthat it conflicted with the reasoning in Goutam Kundu‟s case and held as follows:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">         &quot;13. In a matter where paternity of a child is in issue before the court, the\n         use of DNA is an extremely delicate and sensitive aspect. One view is that\n         when modern science gives means of ascertaining the paternity of a child,\n         there should not be any hesitation to use those means whenever the occasion\n         requires. The other view is that the court must be reluctant in use of such\n         scientific advances and tools which result in invasion of right to privacy of\n         an individual and may not only be prejudicial to the rights of the parties but\n         may have devastating effect on the child. Sometimes the result of such\n         scientific test may bastardise an innocent child even though his mother and\n         her spouse were living together during the time of conception. In our view,\n         when there is apparent conflict between the right to privacy of a person not\n         to submit himself forcibly to medical examination and duty of the court to\n         reach the truth, the court must exercise its discretion only after balancing the\n         interests of the parties and on due consideration whether for a just decision\n         in the matter, DNA is eminently needed. DNA in a matter relating to\n         paternity of a child should not be directed by the court as a matter of course\n\nIA No.4720/2008 in CS(OS) No. 700/2008                                                      Page 7\n          or in a routine manner, whenever such a request is made. The court has to\n         consider diverse aspects including presumption under <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 112</a> of the\n         Evidence Act; pros and cons of such order and the test of `eminent need&#x27;\n         whether it is not possible for the court to reach the truth without use of such\n         test.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">         <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"43471013\" id=\"span_5\">14. There is no conflict in the two decisions of this Court, namely, Goutam\n         Kundu (AIR 1993 SC 2295: 1993 AIR SCW 2325) and Sharda (AIR 2003 SC\n         3450: 2003 AIR SCW 1950). In Goutam Kundu, it has been laid down that\n         courts in India cannot order blood test as a matter of course and such\n         prayers cannot be granted to have roving inquiry; there must be strong\n         prima facie case and court must carefully examine as to what would be the\n         consequence of ordering the blood test. In the case of Sharda while\n         concluding that a matrimonial court has power to order a person to undergo\n         a medical test, it was reiterated that the court should exercise such a power if\n         the applicant has a strong prima facie case and there is sufficient material\n         before the court. Obviously, therefore, any order for DNA can be given by\n         the court only if a strong prima facie case is made out for such a course.\n         Insofar as the present case is concerned, we have already held that the State\n         Commission has no authority, competence or power to order DNA. Looking\n         to the nature of proceedings with which the High Court was concerned, it has\n         to be held that High Court exceeded its jurisdiction in passing the impugned\n         order. Strangely, the High Court over-looked a very material aspect that the\n         matrimonial dispute between the parties is already pending in the court of\n         competent jurisdiction and all aspects concerning matrimonial dispute raised\n         by the parties <a href=\"/doc/43471013/\" id=\"a_18\">in that case</a> shall be adjudicated and determined by that Court.\n         Should an issue arise before the matrimonial court concerning the paternity\n         of the child, obviously that court will be competent to pass an appropriate\n         order at the relevant time in accordance with law. In any view of the matter,\n         it is not possible to sustain the order passed by the High Court.&quot;</span>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1513913\" id=\"span_6\">15.

The presumption of legitimacy of a child born during the subsistence of a lawful wedlock\nis a conclusive one and can only be rebutted in cases of „non-access‟ on the part of either spouse.\nThis emerges from a joint reading of <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_21\">Sections112</a> and <a href=\"/doc/750738/\" id=\"a_22\">4</a> of the Indian Evidence Act. Both the\nsaid provisions are reproduced below:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">       &quot;112. Birth during marriage, conclusive proof of legitimacy.- The fact that any person\n       was born during the continuance of a valid marriage between his mother and any man,\n       or within two hundred and eighty days after its dissolution, the mother remaining\n       unmarried, shall be conclusive proof that he is the legitimate son of that man, unless it\n       can be shown that the parties to the marriage had no access to each other at any time\n       when he could have been begotten.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">       ..........................                          .......................                     .........................\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">       4. &quot; May presume.&quot;- Whenever it is provided by this Act that the Court may presume a\n       fact, it may either regard such fact as proved, unless and until it is disproved, or may call\n       for proof of it: &quot;Shall presume.&quot;- Whenever it is directed by this Act that the Court shall\n       presume a fact, it shall regard such fact as proved, unless and until it is disproved:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">       &quot;Conclusive proof.&quot;- When one fact is declared by this Act to be conclusive proof of\n       another, the Court shall, on proof of the one fact, regard the other as proved, and shall\n       not allow evidence to be given for the purpose of disproving it.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\">17.    In a matter concerning the legitimacy of a child therefore, the Court has to confine itself\nto determining if there was a &quot;lack of access&quot; to either spouse (to a marriage). The legislative\nintent behind this (now seemingly archaic) provision is directed towards safeguarding the\ninterests of the child and protecting it from being bastardized in the event that his paternity is in\nquestion.    The issue here is to what extent, is the presumption (of legitimacy) attracted in\npaternity action which seeks a contrary declaration, i.e. that an individual is the biological (as\nopposed to the legal/legitimate) father of another, and the extent of Court‟s powers to direct the\ndefendant to undergo DNA testing.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">Position in India regarding DNA tests\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\">18.    Scientific evidence such as the results of Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) tests are under\nIndian law to be evidence of one‟s paternity/lineage in that these tests can accurately determine\nwhether or not the persons are biologically related. Such tests, however, have little relevance in a\n\n\n\nIA No.4720/2008 in CS(OS) No. 700/2008                                                        Page 9\n proceeding to determining the „legitimacy‟ of a child. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"505918\" id=\"span_7\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/505918/\" id=\"a_23\">Banarsi Dass</a> (supra), it was\nheld:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">        &quot;13. We may remember that <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 112</a> of the Evidence Act was enacted at a time when\n        the modern scientific advancements with deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) as well as\n        ribonucleic acid (RNA) tests were not even in contemplation of the legislature. The result\n        of a genuine DNA test is said to be scientifically accurate. But even that is not enough\n        to escape from the conclusiveness of <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 112</a> of the Evidence Act e.g. if a husband\n        and wife were living together during the time of conception but the DNA test revealed\n        that the child was not born to the husband, the conclusiveness in law would remain\n        irrefutable. This may look hard from the point of view of the husband who would be\n        compelled to bear the fatherhood of a child of which he may be innocent. But even in\n        such a case the law leans in favour of the innocent child from being bastardised if his\n        mother and her spouse were living together during the time of conception. Hence the\n        question regarding the degree of proof of non-access for rebutting the conclusiveness\n        must be answered in the light of what is meant by access or non-access as delineated\n        above.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\">19.     The above case dealt with a situation where the husband was resisting parenthood of the\nchild. The issue here is in the context of a situation where the child seeks a declaration to the\neffect of ascertaining his paternity, even at the cost of bastardizing himself. The Court\nemphasized that DNA test is not to be directed, as a matter of routine and only in deserving cases\ncould such a direction can be given. On this point, the Supreme Court, in the case of Goutam\nKundu (supra) observed,\n\n        &quot;The position which emerges on reference to these authoritative texts is that depending\n        on the type of litigation, samples of blood, when subjected to skilled scientific\n        examination, can sometimes supply helpful evidence on various issues, to exclude a\n        particular parentage set up in the case. But the consideration remains that the party\n        asserting the claim to have a child and the rival set of parents put to blood test must\n        establish his right so to do. The Court exercises protective jurisdiction on behalf of an\n        infant.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\">20.     This Court notes that the above decisions are authorities in matters where it is the father\nwho is resisting parentage at the cost of bastardizing the child. The same rationale does not\nhowever, apply, in situations where the child, who, on attaining adulthood , moves the Court for\na declaration to determine his/her parentage, as in this case. There would then be no question of\n„protective jurisdiction‟ of the Court since the declaration sought is on his/her behalf about the\ntrue paternity, as opposed to the legitimacy ordained by law. It is true that courts have not come\n\n\nIA No.4720/2008 in CS(OS) No. 700/2008                                                     Page 10\n across an occasion to draw this distinction since invariably the interests of the child has\ndemanded () that its legitimacy should not be jeopardized. The issue of applicability of <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_26\">Section\n112</a> has to be seen from a different trajectory than that in the decided cases; no decision, as yet,\nwith a comparable fact-situation where the offspring of parents, born during the subsistence of\ntheir marriage, sought a paternity declaration that another man (and not his mother‟s husband)\nwas his father, is discernable. Therefore, where it can be established that the husband is not the\nfather of the child, through scientific tests conducted upon them voluntarily, the presumption of\n<a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_27\">Section112</a> can stand rebutted, prima facie. On this presumption, it was observed by the\nSupreme Court in Goutam Kundu (supra)\n\n       &quot;It is a rebuttable presumption of law that a child born during the lawful wedlock is\n       legitimate, and that access occurred between the parents. This presumption can only be\n       displaced by a strong preponderance of evidence, and not by a mere balance of\n       probabilities... This rule of law based on the dictates of justice has always made the\n       courts incline towards upholding the legitimacy of a child unless the facts are so\n       compulsive and clinching as to necessarily warrant a finding that the child could not at\n       all have been begotten to the father and as such a legitimation of the child would result in\n       rank injustice to the father. Courts have always desisted from lightly or hastily rendering\n       a verdict and that too, on the bases of slender materials, which will have the effect of\n       branding a child as a bastard and its mother an unchaste woman.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\">Development in statute law in India\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_22\">21.    <a href=\"/doc/56319/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 14</a> of the Family Courts Act, 1984 enacts if any evidence which would otherwise\nnot be relevant/admissible under the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_29\">Evidence Act</a>, assists the Court, may be both relevant and\nadmissible in such proceedings. Therefore, while the presumption under <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 112</a> of the\nEvidence Act renders the results of such tests futile as to the legitimacy of the child, the\nrelevance of such tests cannot be disregarded, in regard to matters and disputes covered by the\n<a href=\"/doc/373687/\" id=\"a_31\">Family Courts Act</a>, and triable under it. <a href=\"/doc/681440/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 7</a> of the Act provides for jurisdiction of the\nCourt in this respect:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">       &quot;7.

The entire focus of attention and legislative concern in enacting <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 112</a> with a near\nimpregnable presumption of legitimacy was premised on the welfare or best interests of a child,\nand society‟s assurance that a child born to a woman after the marriage, should not - except\nunder limited circumstances - be exposed to any inquiry about who was his true father. This\noverarching concern also was aimed at protecting a woman from allegations of unchastity, and\nthe resultant harassment that she could be subjected to in legal proceedings. While those\nconcerns are as real today as they were when the provision was enacted, nevertheless subsequent\nchanges in women‟s status, the rights enjoyed by them, scientific developments and\nadvancements, and changes in legal provisions which recognize a child‟s right to know its\nbiological antecedents, cannot be ignored. Another related aspect is that when the provision was\nenacted, women had no property rights; in England, they were not even enfranchised. The law\nwas conceived and put in place by a colonial power. Its possible intersection and perhaps tension\n\nIA No.4720/2008 in CS(OS) No. 700/2008                                                    Page 12\n with paternity actions, and the impact such a presumption could have on those proceedings, was\nnot conceived. This issue assumes importance in the present case where it is the child who seeks\na declaration to ascertain his parenthood. The Court‟s present concern is as to the paternity of the\nplaintiff and whether the Defendant is his biological father. Here, there is a legitimate interest of\nthe child in the knowledge of his true parents. Such a child has a right to know, and to be\nafforded the company of his true parents, unless such knowledge is detrimental to his interest.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">International Covenants and developments in other jurisdictions\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_25\">23.    The right of the child to know of her (or his) biological antecedents is now recognized\ninternationally as being of critical importance. Major international instruments such as the UN\nDeclaration on Human Rights have recognized the rights of a child irrespective of her (or his)\nlegitimacy and the Convention on the Rights of Child, 1990 has expressly specified a right to\nknowledge of parenthood. Parts of the Convention on the Rights of Child dealing with this aspect\nare produced as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">       &quot;<a href=\"/doc/735354/\" id=\"a_36\">Article 7</a>\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">       1. The child shall be registered immediately after birth and shall have the right\n       from birth to a name, the right to acquire a nationality and. as far as possible,\n       the right to know and be cared for by his or her parents....&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\">24.    The Convention therefore, specifically requires that as far as possible, the State must\nenable the child to know of his true paternity. A mention in this regard may also be made of the\ndevelopments in the United States and United Kingdom where this right has had a crucial\ninfluence on decisions to permit the conduct of reliable scientific tests on the mother, the child\nand the party alleged to be the father in order to determine the paternity of the child. Excerpts\nfrom the S.532 McKinney‟s <a href=\"/doc/373687/\" id=\"a_37\">Family Courts Act</a> in the United States are reproduced:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">       &quot;§ 532.

A child‟s right to know of her or his biological parentage has had a critical influence also\nmany developments in Europe that have lead to lifting the anonymity of a „donor‟ in assisted\npregnancies and in case of sperm donors. Such donors remained anonymous in Europe till the\n1980s. However, later developments mark a shift from the anonymity based approach, and the\nCourts, tend to lean in support of the child‟s right to know her or his biological antecedents.\nSimilar laws have been passed in many countries all over the world (such as Sweden in 1985,\nfollowing which almost all of Europe with the latest addition of the United Kingdom has\nfollowed suit). In the Human Fertilization and Embryology Authority Regulations 2004, the\nchildren in United Kingdom have the right to obtain information about their donors after they\nreach the age of 18. The age prescription, in such regulations, are seen as a check towards\nprotecting the child‟s interests in legitimacy. These developments all over the world indicate that\nthere is a very tenable argument in the child‟s interests that support its right to know the truth of\nits origin.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\">26.     A distinction has to be drawn here between „legitimacy‟ and „paternity‟ of the child.\n<a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 112</a> of the Act was a provision enacted by the British directed at safeguarding the\ninterests of the child by securing its legitimacy. This provision was modeled around a rigid\nEnglish law system, which may be aptly summarized in the majority opinion in the case of\nRussel v. Russel, (1924) AC 687 where it was held that neither the declarations of the wife, nor\nher testimony that the child was the child of a man other than her husband were admissible as\nevidence to prove or disprove paternity. Similarly, the evidence of the husband that he was not\n\n\nIA No.4720/2008 in CS(OS) No. 700/2008                                                           Page 14\n the father of the child was also inadmissible in that regard. However, it was the dissenting\nopinion of Lord Summers that gained more importance over the years. He held that:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">              &quot;in the administration of justice nothing is of higher importance than that all\n       relevant evidence should be admissible and should be heard by the tribunal that is\n       charged with deciding according to the truth.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_29\">27.    The law in England is now guided by the Family Reforms Act, 1969 (later replaced by\nthe 1987 Act); it enables the Court to draw a distinction between parentage and paternity thus\nallows conduct of tests to determine who is the biological father of the child. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"682973\" id=\"span_8\">In highlighting the\nimportance of the right of the child to know the truth of its paternity the court, in <a href=\"/doc/682973/\" id=\"a_39\">W. v.

English law on this point has no doubt undergone a major change. No such distinction\nhas been statutorily created in Indian law and it is not in this Court‟s domain to do so. However,\nthis Court is of the opinion that the object        of <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 112</a> of the Act was to determine\n„legitimacy‟ and not „paternity‟. Such an interpretation to this provision would be in accordance\nwith both the UN Declaration on Human Rights and the Conventions on the Rights of Child.\nIndia is a ratifying party to both these international instruments and as such, they constitute an\nobligation on the State under <a href=\"/doc/346437/\" id=\"a_41\">Article 51(c)</a> of the Constitution. Where the provisions of law may\nbe interpreted in different ways, the law is to be interpreted in a manner that would ensure\ncompliance with the State‟s international obligations, if it is consistent with provisions of Part III\nof the Constitution of India. Such a construction assumes special importance in cases where\nhuman rights of the individuals are concerned. The Supreme Court has sought to use this rule of\nconstruction to harmonize India‟s domestic laws with its international obligations in matters\ndealing with valuable human rights on many instances. This rule assumes relevance in instances\nwhere there has either been legislative inactivity leading to a lacuna in the law, or a law has\nbecome so archaic that it is not in conformity with the existing system of rights.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_31\">29.    In the Case of Vishakha v. State of Rajasthan, ( 1997 ) 6 SCC 241 for instance, the Court\nsought to take steps towards providing valuable human rights to women where the legislature\n\nIA No.4720/2008 in CS(OS) No. 700/2008                                                       Page 15\n had refrained from doing so in order to harmonise India‟s international obligations with treaty\nlaw. In the case of P.U.C.L v. Union of India, (1997) 1 SCC 301 then, the Apex Court held:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">       &quot;It is accepted that a statute is to be interpreted and applied, as far as its\n       language permits, so that it is in conformity and not in conflict with the\n       established rules of international law...Apart from influencing the construction of\n       a statute or subordinate legislation, an international convention may play a part\n       in the development by the courts of the common law.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_32\">30.    This Court cannot disregard the interests of the child in this regard to know of his\nbiological roots. This „right to know‟ can be enforced through reliable scientific tests, absent any\noverriding concern that directing such tests are not in the best interests of the child. There is of\ncourse, the vital interests of child to not be branded „illegitimate‟; yet the conclusiveness of the\npresumption created by the law in this regard must not act detriment to the interests of the child.\nIf the interests of the child are best sub-served by establishing paternity of someone who is not\nthe husband of her (or his) mother, the Court should not shut that consideration altogether. The\nprotective cocoon of legitimacy, in such case, should not entomb the child‟s aspiration to learn\nthe truth of her or his paternity. The Court is of opinion that „legitimacy‟ and „paternity‟ are both\nvalid interests of the child that may be accorded recognition under Indian law without prejudice\nto each other. While „legitimacy‟ may be established by a legal presumption, „paternity‟ has to\nbe established by science and other reliable evidence. In this specific matter, the plaintiff has\nsought a declaration, as to his „paternity‟. Any such declaration will have no bearing upon his\nlegitimacy, which as such, will continue to be governed by the conclusive presumption in\n<a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 112</a>.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_33\">31.    Indian law casts an obligation upon a biological father to maintain his child; does not\ndisregard the rights of an illegitimate child to maintenance. <a href=\"/doc/946025/\" id=\"a_43\">The Hindu Adoptions and\nMaintenance Act, 1956</a> for example, specifically provides for maintenance of illegitimate\nchildren in <a href=\"/doc/1577106/\" id=\"a_44\">Sections 20</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1712157/\" id=\"a_45\">21</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1021266/\" id=\"a_46\">22</a> of the Act.

Similarly, the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_47\">Code of Criminal Procedure</a> enacts an &quot;umbrella&quot; provision that imposes a\nlegal duty upon a person to provide maintenance for his children, irrespective of whether such\nchild is legitimate or otherwise:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">       &quot;<a href=\"/doc/94809/\" id=\"a_48\">Section 125</a> - Order for maintenance of wives, children and parents\n\n       (1) If any person having sufficient means neglects or refuses to maintain.-\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">           (a) his wife, unable to maintain herself, or\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">           (b) his legitimate or illegitimate minor child, whether married or not, unable to\n           maintain itself, or\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">           (c) his legitimate or illegitimate child (not being a married daughter) who has\n           attained majority, where such child is, by reason of any physical or mental\n           abnormality or injury unable to maintain itself, or...&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_42\">                                                             (emphasis supplied)\n\n\n\n\nIA No.4720/2008 in CS(OS) No. 700/2008                                                     Page 17\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_43\"> 33.     The right to maintenance therefore is an inalienable right of a child, even if illegitimate,\nunder Indian law. In circumstances where the child cannot be maintained, it will in fact be in its\nbest interests to ascertain the child‟s true paternity to ensure that he or she can avail the benefit of\nmaintenance. Thus, children of women born as a result of forced or non-consensual sexual\nrelations, or either due to the social status, or dominant economic power of the biological father\n(or as a result of rape of a married woman) even during the subsistence of the woman‟s marriage,\ncan claim their right to maintenance. The domain of property rights is an entirely different\nmatter and concerns only legitimate children, which will not be affected, by a finding relating to\nthe paternity of the child.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_44\">34.     It may now be necessary to tie the disparate threads of reasoning together, at this stage.\n„Legitimacy‟ and „paternity‟ are two distinct concepts in law. <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_49\">Section 112</a> of the Indian Evidence\nAct deals only with legitimacy, and not paternity. The idea behind this provision was to establish\na conclusive presumption in favour of the „legitimacy‟ of a child to not subject him or her to the\nstigma of being a „bastard‟. The said presumption, however, is conclusive only as regards the\n„legitimacy‟ of the child and not its „paternity‟. Unless the Court feels in certain circumstances\nthat it is against the interests of the child to know of its „paternity‟, the Court is justified in\nascertaining the „paternity‟ of the child through reliable scientific tests such as DNA tests. This is\nof course, subject to the caveat (on account of the existing structure of <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_50\">Section 112</a>) that such\ntests can be directed, after the Court is prima facie satisfied on the basis of evidence on the\nrecord that there was no access (to the mother) at the relevant time. A finding as regards the\npaternity of the child through such means will not prejudice the conclusiveness of the\npresumption established by <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_51\">Section 112</a> of the Evidence Act. Such a child, who has sought a\ndeclaration by the Court towards ascertaining his or her           paternity, may continue to be a\nlegitimate child in law under the presumption of <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_52\">Section 112</a>. Such a construction is in line with\ninternational instruments to which India is a ratifying party and the widely cherished „right to\nknow‟ of the child. A finding of „paternity‟ would, in certain circumstances, also enable the child\nto avail of maintenance under<a href=\"/doc/1056396/\" id=\"a_53\"> S.125</a> of the Cr.P.C. 1973, and other provisions of law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_45\">35.     The Court would now examine if a third party (to a marriage, like the first defendant\nhere) may be compelled to undergo scientific tests of the nature of giving blood samples for the\n\n\n\nIA No.4720/2008 in CS(OS) No. 700/2008                                                         Page 18\n purpose of DNA testing. The case of Goutam Kundu (supra) provides us with assistance here. In\nthis case, the Court held that\n\n       &quot;1. A matrimonial court has the power to order a person to undergo medical test.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_46\">       2. Passing of such an order by the court would not be in violation of the right to personal\n       liberty under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_54\">Article 21</a> of the Indian Constitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_47\">       3. However, the Court should exercise such a power if the applicant has a strong prima\n       facie case and there is sufficient material before the Court. If despite the order of the\n       court, the respondent refuses to submit himself to medical examination, the court will be\n       entitled to draw an adverse inference against him.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_48\">36.    While the Court here advised that such tests should not be conducted in a routine manner,\nit did not ban their conduct, upon the third party, altogether. It held that ordering a test upon a\nperson to determine biological relationships between him and the plaintiff would not attract the\nsanction of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_55\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India. The Law Commission of India in its 185th\nReport further made certain observations in this regard and recommended modifying<a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_56\"> S.112</a> as\nfollows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">       Birth during marriage conclusive proof of legitimacy except in certain cases\n       &quot;112 The fact that any child was born during the continuance of a valid marriage\n       between its mother and any man, or within two hundred and eighty days,\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">               (i) after the marriage was declared nullity, the mother remaining\n                        unmarried, or\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_38\">               (ii) after the marriage was avoided by dissolution, the mother remaining\n                        unmarried,\n\n       shall be conclusive proof that such person is the legitimate child of that man,\n       unless\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_39\">                     (a) it can be shown that the parties to the marriage had no access\n                         to each other at any time when the child could have been\n                         begotten; or\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_40\">                     (b) it is conclusively established, by tests conducted at the\n                         expense of that man, namely,\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_41\">                           (i) medical tests, that, at the relevant time, that man was\n                                   impotent or sterile, and is not the father of the child;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_49\">                                   or\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_50\">                           (ii) blood tests conducted with the consent of that man and\n                                   his wife and in the case of the child, by permission of\n\nIA No.4720/2008 in CS(OS) No. 700/2008                                                     Page 19\n                                    the Court, that that man is not the father of the child;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_51\">                                   or\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_52\">                           (iii) DNA genetic printing tests conducted with the consent of\n                                   that man and in the case of the child, by permission of\n                                   the Court, that that man is not the father of the child;\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_53\">                                   and\n                       Provided that the Court is satisfied that the test under sub-clause (i) or\n                       sub-clause (ii) or sub-clause (iii) has been conducted in a scientific\n                       manner according to accepted procedures, and in the case of each of these\n                       sub-clauses (i) or (ii) or (iii) of clause (b), at least two tests have been\n                       conducted, and they resulted in an identical verdict that that man is not\n                       the father of the child.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_54\">                       Provided further that where that man refuses to undergo the tests under\n                       sub clauses (i) or (ii) or (iii), he shall, without prejudice to the provisions\n                       of clause (a), be deemed to have waived his defence to any claim of\n                       paternity made against him.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_55\">                  Explanation I: For the purpose of sub clause (iii) of clause (b), the words\n           „DNA genetic printing tests‟ shall mean the tests conducted by way of samples\n           relatable to the husband and child and the words &quot;DNA&quot; mean „Deoxyribo-Nucleic\n           Acid‟.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_56\">                   Explanation II: For the purposes of this section, the words „valid marriage‟\n           shall mean a void marriage till it is declared nullity or a voidable marriage till it is\n           avoided by dissolution, where, by any enactment for the time being in force, it is\n           provided that the children of such marriages which are declared nullity or avoided by\n           dissolution, shall nevertheless be legitimate.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_57\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"43471013\" id=\"span_9\">37.   The Court notes that the above Law Commission proposal does not allow a third party to\nbe compelled to undergo such tests against his liberty and is confined in its applicability to the\nhusband of the mother. However, as the Court in <a href=\"/doc/43471013/\" id=\"a_57\">Sharda and Jena</a> (Supra) observed, there is no\nviolation of the right to life, or privacy, or such third party, in directing a DNA test, to be\nundergone by him.</span> The three Judge Bench in Sharda (supra) stated in no uncertain terms that a\ndirection, (after taking into consideration all relevant facts), to the person, to undergo such a test\nis not an invasion of his right to life. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"43471013\" id=\"span_10\"><a href=\"/doc/43471013/\" id=\"a_58\">Bhabani Prasad Jena</a> (supra), after noticing all the previous\njudgments, including Goutam Kundu and Sharda, on the point, affirmed the power of the Court\nto direct a DNA test by one of the parties, and stated that it must be exercised with caution, after\nweighing all &quot;pros and cons&quot;, the evidence, and satisfying itself if the &quot;test of `eminent need&#x27;&quot;</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_42\">for such an order, is fulfilled. This Court is therefore, bound by those principles.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_43\">IA No.4720/2008 in CS(OS) No. 700/2008                                                       Page 20\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_44\"> 38.    The facts here are that the plaintiff is the son of the second defendant, who is his mother.\nShe was married to Sh. B.D. Sharma, who is not a party to the proceeding. In support of his\nclaim, the plaintiff relies not only on pleadings but on more than a hundred photographs, taken\nfrom the time of his childhood, several of them with the first defendant. Many of these include\noccasions like birthday parties, festivals, and some even capture moments where they (the\nplaintiff and the first defendant) shared moments together. To be fair to the first defendant, there\ncan be explanations; yet prima facie there appears to be some consistency or pattern in his\nbehavior; he is definitely seen as a close friend of the family, with a special fondness for the\nplaintiff. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant used to see him very frequently, and he had\naccess, but later he was denied such access, to the first defendant and that the last time he could\nmeet the plaintiff was in 2005.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_45\">39.    The first defendant does not deny knowing the plaintiff‟s mother, i.e. the second\ndefendant. The latter has filed an affidavit saying that though she was married to B.D. Sharma,\nthey stopped living together since 1970. She also relies on certified copies of divorce\nproceedings, to say that her marriage with him had been dissolved. The first defendant points\nthat these documents establish that the second defendant and her husband, B.D. Sharma, were\nliving in the same building, albeit on separate floors. This according to the first defendant is\ndestructive of the plaintiff‟s plea about non access of B.D. Sharma to the second defendant. It is\nalso submitted that if the Court were to direct that blood samples of the first defendant should\nbe given, for the purpose of DNA testing on the strength of these materials, grave prejudice\nwould occur to him. It is urged that such an order is fraught with serious consequences, because\ntwo people who are parties to a marriage, can collude, and allege that their child is the natural or\nbiological son or daughter of another, with the evil motive of grabbing his property, or tarnishing\nhis reputation.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_46\">40.    Documents have been filed by the plaintiff, on the record to establish that both Sh. B.P.\nSharma and Mrs. Ujjwala Sharma were estranged in 1970 and subsequently their marriage was\ndissolved. Both of them have filed affidavits in this regard. The Court, at this stage, cannot\ndisbelieve them. Additional evidence has been placed on the record, in the form of a DNA test\nreport conducted on the plaintiff and Sh. B.P. Sharma that categorically states that he cannot be\nthe father of the plaintiff. This report has been supported by his affidavit, as well as that of the\nplaintiff, stating that such tests were conducted upon them voluntarily. The Court, at this stage\n\n\nIA No.4720/2008 in CS(OS) No. 700/2008                                                      Page 21\n has no reason to disbelieve their statements, on affidavit, or results of the test. In this case, the\nplaintiff is a major, capable of taking his decisions, and there is no question of his welfare being\nadversely affected, by an order, that would facilitating determination of his true biological roots.\nThe facts alleged by him, his mother, and his (legitimate) father, are that the first defendant is the\nplaintiff‟s biological father. Therefore, he wishes the Court to declare his paternity. The Court\ntherefore, has to deal with a situation where the plaintiff is seeking the relief, on the basis of his\ninformed decision.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_47\">41.     As far as the first defendant‟s submission that incalculable harm would ensue if he is\ndirected to undergo DNA testing is concerned, on the ground that doing so would be sanctioning\nthe dubious motives of grasping individuals, who may collusively level false allegations, with a\nview to profit and extort from vulnerable persons, the Court notices that there are sufficient\nguidelines framed by virtue of the law declared in Goutam Kundu and Bhabani Prasad Jena,\nwhich the Court must follow;. these are:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_48\">(i)     Existence of a fair degree of prima facie case (revealing non-access);\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_49\">(ii)    welfare of the child;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_50\">(iii)   A need to balance the rights of two competing claims, i.e. the one for paternity and the\none for privacy (or autonomy), and direct a test if there is eminent need to do so.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_58\">42.     Scientific tests on record have prima facie established that no biological relationship\nexists between the plaintiff and Sh. B.P. Sharma. These tests, on the strength of precedent, are\nnot dismissive of the „legitimacy‟ of the plaintiff and are irrelevant in that regard. They,\nhowever, do indicate that B.P Sharma voluntarily subjected himself to such procedure, and\nfurther that he is not the plaintiff‟s biological father. This Court, as observed earlier is not\nconcerned with the plaintiff‟s legitimacy , and is called upon to make a declaration in order to\nhelp him to ascertain his true biological roots. No doubt, there are possibilities that the first\ndefendant is not the biological father; the Court cannot direct him to undergo DNA test on the\nassumption that he is the father, at the mere asking of the plaintiff. That is where, the other\nmaterials, such as the second defendant mother‟s affidavit, and photographs of the plaintiff,\ntogether with the first defendant, are relevant. They do, taken cumulatively with such the DNA\ntest results, indicate a strong prima facie case, suggesting &quot;eminent need&quot; to issue the directions.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_59\">IA No.4720/2008 in CS(OS) No. 700/2008                                                        Page 22\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_60\"> 43.     So far as the first defendant‟s argument of collusion, and the further submission, that the\nmere fact that the DNA test report points to Sh. B.P. Sharma not being the biological father, in\nturn nowhere indicates his involvement, is concerned, the Court is of opinion that this is\nprecisely where an overall prima facie analysis of the materials, is necessary. These overall\nmaterials are on record in the form of photographs some pertaining to special personal occasions,\nand others showing the plaintiff and first defendant in public functions, as well as Ujjwala\nSharma‟s affidavit, which prima facie disclose a strong probability that fulfils the &quot;eminent\nneed&quot; to direct such DNA testing of the first defendant‟s blood samples. The defendants‟\narguments facially do not point to any prejudice to him which outweigh the strong prima facie\ncase, and eminent need for the test.
