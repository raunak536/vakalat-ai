The petitioners are challenging the in-action on part of the\n    respondents        in\n                             closing        the    rowdy       sheet       vide\n\n    C.No.491/Genl/SDPO-N/2019               dated.30.04.2019    which      was\n\n\n\n    opened by the 4&#x27;^ respondent against the petitioners.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_2\"> 2. The petitioners were shown as Accused in SC.No.91 of 2023\n    and the petitioners was acquitted vide judgment dated\n    01.11.2024 by the learned X Additional District and Sessions\n    Judge, West Godavari at Narsapur.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_3\"> 3. The learned counsel for the petitioners submits                 that    the\n\n\n   respondents have not closed the rowdy sheet though there IS no\n   case pending for a period of five years from the date of opening\n\n   of the rowdy sheet against the petitioner.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_4\">4. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioners submits that\n   continuation of rowdy sheet against the petitioners is also a\n   social sigma on the petitioners. It is also submitted                   that\n\n\n   continuation of the rowdy sheet against the petitioners without\n   any valid reason amounts to interfering with the fundamental\n   rights of the petitioners i.e., right to live with dignity and the right\n\n   guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1024002/\" id=\"a_5\">Article 19(1 )(d).</a>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_5\"> -T-\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_6\">                                      .   ,//3//\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                                                 WP.No.9357 of 2025</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_7\">      5.   The learned Assistant Government Pleader representing              the\n\n\n           respondents submits filed counter and submits that the Police\n\n           Standing Orders 602(2) clearly mentioned that nothing precludes\n\n           the SP/DCP/CP from continuing a rowdy sheet on the                sole\n\n\n           ground that the rowdy sheeter is not figuring as an accused in\n\n           the previous five years. It would depend upon the nature of the\n\n           activities of the rowdy sheeter for continuing the suspect sheet to\n\n           enable peace and tranquility in the society.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_8\">      6. The learned Assistant Government Pleader appearing for the\n\n           state does not dispute that there are no cases pending against\n\n           the petitioners: however submits that the petitioners activities\n\n           would require continuous surveillance for the police to maintain\n\n           the law and order in the state.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">      7.   Heard the learned counsel appearing for the petitioners and the\n\n           learned Assistant Government Pleader for the state and perused\n\n           the material on record.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_10\">      8. The following questions would fall for consideration of these writ\n\n           petitions ;\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\">            I.   Whether the fundamental right under <a href=\"/doc/1024002/\" id=\"a_6\">Article 19(1 )(d)</a> of\n                 a Citizen is infringed upon on account of continued\n                 surveillance under the guise of opening and continuing\n                 rowdy sheet ?\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_12\">                                   //4//\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                                           WP.No.9357 of 2025</span>\n\n\n\n      . The scope of judicial review of rowdy sheet / rowdy\n         sheet    on   the     touchstone   of reasonableness,\n         arbitrariness and non-application of mind ?\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_13\">9. It is also not in dispute that the petitioners were not convicted of\n    any offence(s). The stand taken by the respondents, that the\n    Police Standing Orders would empower the respondents to open\n    rowdy sheets/rowdy sheets in order to maintain law and order IS\n\n   not an unfettered right. The Police Standing Orders do not have\n   statutory force. The standing orders are only administrative\n   instructions. It is also not in dispute that the Police Standing\n   Orders which are issued under the <a href=\"/doc/1481639/\" id=\"a_7\">Police Act</a> would have\n   statutory force.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_14\">10. It is pertinent to refer to Chapter 31 of the A.P. Police Code\n\n   which contains 24 Standing Orders. They deal with the Station\n\n   Crime history. Standing Orders 733 to 741 and Standing Order\n   749 deal with Rowdy sheets. Standing Order 742 deals with\n\n   rowdy sheets.

On the facts of the\n                                present case, the continuance of rowdy sheet\n           against the petitioners would\n                                                    amount to illegal surveillances\n          which is an arbitrary act\n                                        on part of the state. The same includes\n          the right to privacy and violates <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_12\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of\n          India. At the same time i\n                                        it is made clear that keeping a person\n          under watch to prevent crime and to maintain law and order               as\n\n         authorized by law is\n                                a reasonable restriction which is permissible\n         under the Constitution of India.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_28\">   14. There is no justification i\n                                 in continuation of the rowdy sheet\n         against the petitioners        more so when there was no case\n\n         registered against the petitioners for a period of five years from\n        the date of opening of the\n                                       rowdy sheet. The pending case\n        against the petitioners would also not warrant continuance of the\n        rowdy sheet against the petitioners.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_29\">  15.
