The present appeal is against the judgment and decree\n\n     dated 04.01.2019 passed by the Family Court Bemetara\n\n     in Civil Suit No.9-A/2017 wherein the application filed by\n\n     the wife under <a href=\"/doc/322349/\" id=\"a_1\">section 9</a> of the Hindu Marriage Act for\n\n     restitution of conjugal rights was allowed. Hence this\n\n     appeal by the husband.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">  2. The brief facts of the case are that the parties have\n\n     entered in wedlock on 22.04.2016. Out of such wedlock,\n\n     a child was born on 20.10.2016.         Since it was a\n\n     premature birth, the child was admitted to hospital. After\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                            2</span>\n\n  two months of treatment, the child was discharged and\n\n  thereafter the wife joined the company of husband.\n\n  However, since February 2017, the behavior of the in-\n\n  laws towards the wife became strange and she along\n\n  with child was forcibly left at her maternal home in\n\n  village Jhhal. Subsequently, the wife came to know that\n\n  the child was subjected to DNA without the consent of\n\n  the mother and it was alleged that the child begotten to\n\n  them and the husband was not a biological father, as\n\n  such, dispute arose.    The wife further contended that\n\n  since the husband wanted a divorce as he is in love\n\n  affairs with a lady outside the marriage, she was forcibly\n\n  left at maternal home. Thereafter the wife filed a report\n\n  at Women Police station Bemetara where she came to\n\n  know that DNA test got conducted on the child by\n\n  applying wrong method        without following the legal\n\n  norms.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">3. The husband in his reply to the application<a href=\"/doc/322349/\" id=\"a_2\"> u/s 9</a> pleaded\n\n  that the marriage took place on 22.04.2016, the Gowna\n\n  rituals was performed on 18.05.2016 and thereafter\n\n  within a period of 5 months, a child was born on\n\n  22.10.2016.    It is further pleaded that the child was\n\n  further subjected to DNA test and it was found that he\n\n  was not biological father. Consequently, the child was\n\n  left along with the mother at her parental place.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_5\">4. The learned trial Court framed 3 issues and allowed the\n\n  application of the wife for restitution of conjugal rights.\n\n  Being aggrieved by the said order, the present appeal.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_6\">5. The learned counsel for the appellant would submits that\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                            3</span>\n\n  during the proceeding under <a href=\"/doc/322349/\" id=\"a_3\">section 9</a> of the Family\n\n  Court, an application was filed by the husband to get the\n\n  DNA test of the child and the wife, which was allowed.\n\n  However, despite that the wife refused to expose\n\n  themselves for DNA test. As a result, the inference of\n\n  <a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_4\">section 114</a> of the Evidence Act would be applicable. He\n\n  further submits that the wife knowing the fact that the\n\n  answer to the DNA test is &quot;unfavourable&quot;, refused to\n\n  expose along with child for DNA test. He placed reliance\n\n  in Dipanwita Roy Versus Ronobroto Roy (2015) 1\n\n  SCC 365 and would submit that the petition for divorce\n\n  is already pending before the Court and despite refusal\n\n  of the wife to get herself to be expose to DNA, if the\n\n  findings are not set aside in this case then it would have\n\n  an adverse affect on the divorce petition. Therefore, he\n\n  prays that the judgment of the court below be set aside.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_7\">6. Per contra, learned counsel for the respondent would\n\n  submit that birth of the child was premature and as per\n\n  <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_5\">section 112</a> of the Evidence Act, the presumption of\n\n  paternity of the child would be covered that he is a\n\n  biological child. Consequently the order of the learned\n\n  family Court allowing the application<a href=\"/doc/529244/\" id=\"a_6\"> u/s 9</a> of th <a href=\"/doc/590166/\" id=\"a_7\">Hindu\n\n  Marriage Act</a> is well merited, which does not call for any\n\n  interference.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_8\">7. We have heard learned counsel for the parties.       The\n\n  primary dispute which arose between the husband and\n\n  wife was for the reason that a child was born after 5\n\n  months of their marriage.    Under these circumstances,\n\n  the dispute arose and the wife was left at her parental\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                4</span>\n\n  place along with the child.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_9\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"159613381\" id=\"span_4\">8. A perusal of the order sheets of the court below would\n\n  show that the defence was taken by the appellant that\n\n  the child begotten to them, he is not the biological father\n\n  and as such an application for DNA test was filed. The\n\n  learned family Court by its order dated 31.7.2018\n\n  allowed the application of the husband for DNA of the\n\n  child and wife. This order was subject of challenge in\n\n  W.P.No.131/2021 wherein this Court by order dated\n\n  09.07.2021 followed the case law reported               (2015) 1\n\n  SCC 365 (<a href=\"/doc/159613381/\" id=\"a_8\">Dipanwita Roy v. Ronobroto Roy</a>) and observed\n\n  that although there is an order for D.N.A Test passed by\n\n  the trial Court, but the wife has option not to participate\n\n  in DNA test and dismissed the petition.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"160470236\" id=\"span_5\">9. The Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/160470236/\" id=\"a_9\">Sharda v. Dharampal</a> (2003)\n\n  4 SCC 493 has dealt with similar issue when the DNA\n\n  test is sought by one of the parties and at para 20\n\n  referred to the decision rendered by English Court in\n\n  B.R.B. Versus J.B      (1968) 2 All ER 1023 wherein\n\n  it was held thus :</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">              &quot;A Judge of the High Court has power to\n          order a blood test whenever it is in the best\n          interest of the child. The Judges can be trusted\n          to exercise this discretion wisely.             No limit-\n          condition or bound is set up to the way in which\n          Judges exercise their discretion.         The object of\n          the court always is to find out the truth. When\n          scientific   advances        give   fresh   means      of\n          ascertaining   it,       there   should   not   be   any\n          hesitations to use those means whenever the\n          occasion requires&quot;.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                              5</span>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1259126\" id=\"span_7\">10. Further, in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1259126/\" id=\"a_10\">Goutam Kundu v. State of\n\n   W.B.</a> AIR 1993 SC 2295 initially the Court has held\n\n   that Courts in India cannot order blood test as a matter\n\n   of course and whenever applications are made for such\n\n   prayers in order to have roving inquiry, the prayer for\n\n   blood test cannot be entertained. It was further held that\n\n   the Court must carefully examine as to what would be\n\n   the consequence of ordering the blood test; whether it\n\n   will have the effect of branding a child as a bastard and\n\n   the mother as an unchaste woman and therefore no\n\n   person can be compelled to give sample of blood for\n\n   analysis.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"167495843\" id=\"span_8\">11. The said finding was further considered in case of\n\n   <a href=\"/doc/167495843/\" id=\"a_11\">Sharda vs. Dharampal</a>          (supra) and the Court held\n\n   that if the respondent avoids such medical examination\n\n   on the ground that it violates his/her right to privacy or\n\n   for that matter right to personal liberty as enshrined\n\n   under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_12\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India, then it may\n\n   in most of such cases become impossible to arrive at a\n\n   conclusion. It was further held that no right to privacy\n\n   specifically conferred by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_13\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of\n\n   India and with the extensive interpretation of the phrase\n\n   &quot;personal liberty&quot; this right has been read into <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_14\">Article\n\n   21</a>, it cannot be treated as an absolute right. It was held\n\n   that some limitations on this right have to be imposed\n\n   and particularly where two competing interests clash.\n\n   The <a href=\"/doc/167495843/\" id=\"a_15\">Court further held</a> if for arriving at the satisfaction of\n\n   the court and to protect the right of a party to the lis\n\n   who may otherwise be found to be incapable of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                  6</span>\n\n   protecting   his   own   interest,   the court   passes   an\n\n   appropriate order, the question of such action being\n\n   violative of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_16\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India would\n\n   not arise. It was further held that the court having\n\n   regard to <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_17\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India must also\n\n   see to it that the right of a person to defend himself\n\n   must be adequately protected. The limitation was further\n\n   imposed that court cannot order for a roving inquiry and\n\n   there must have sufficient materials before it to enable it\n\n   to exercise its discretion.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">12. Lately thereafter the Supreme Court in Narayan Dutt\n\n   Tiwari v. Rohit Shekhar (2012) 12 SCC 554                 at\n\n   Para 40 has reproduced the observations from the Court\n\n   of Appeal (Civil Division) of H. and A. (Children Paternity\n\n   Tests), which reads thus:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">            &quot;40. Though in the light of what we have held, it\n            is not strictly relevant, but we are unable to\n            restrain ourselves from recording what the Court\n            of Appeal (Civil Division) observed in H. and A.\n            (Children) (Paternity : Blood Tests), In re- 2002\n            EWCA (Civ) 383 :\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">            <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"133524703\" id=\"span_10\">&quot;Over thirty years ago in his speech in <a href=\"/doc/133524703/\" id=\"a_18\">S. v. McC\n            Lord Hodson</a> said : (AC pp. 57 F-58 A)\n\n            &#x27;......The only disadvantage to the child which is\n            put forward as an argument against the use of a\n            blood test, not for therapeutic purposes but to\n            ascertain paternity, is that the child is exposed\n            to the risk that he may lose the protection of the\n            presumption of legitimacy.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">            Without seeking to depreciate the value of this\n            presumption it is, I think, fair to say that\n            whatever may have been the position in the\n            past the general attitude towards illegitimacy\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                         7</span>\n\n    has changed and the legal incidents of being\n    born a bastard are now almost non-existent. I\n    need not dilate upon this, for I recognise that it\n    is impossible to say that there is no stigma of\n    bastardy even though it be no more than the\n    indirect stigma of the imputation of unchastity\n    to the mother of the child so described. On the\n    other hand, it is difficult to conceive of cases\n    where, assuming illegitimacy in fact, it is to the\n    advantage of the child that this legal status of\n    legitimacy should be preserved only perhaps to\n    be displaced by firm evidence of illegitimacy\n    decided later in his or her life from a blood test.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">    The interests of justice in the abstract are best\n    served by the ascertainment of the truth and\n    their must be few cases where the interests of\n    children can be shown to be best served by the\n    suppression of truth. Scientific evidence of blood\n    groups has been available since the early part of\n    this century and the progress of serology has\n    been so rapid that in many cases certainty or\n    near    certainty       can   be    reached     in    the\n    ascertainment of paternity. Why should the risk\n    be taken of a judicial decision being made which\n    is   factually   wrong        and    may      later   be\n    demonstrated to be wrong ?&#x27;\n\nThose principles have been consistently applied in\nsubsequent cases, including H. (A Minor) (Blood\nTests : Parental Rights), In re-1997 Fam 89 : (1996) 3\nWLR 506 and T. (A Child) (DNA Tests : Paternity), In\nre- (2001) 3 FCR 577. The Jude sought to distinguish\nthose two authorities in his concluding paragraph,\nwhich I have cited above. It draws the distinction that\nin those two cases there were serious doubts as to\nthe husband&#x27;s    procreative      capacities. I     do    not\nconsider that factual distinction begins to displace\nthe points of principle to be drawn from the cases,\nfirst that the interests of justice are best served by\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                8</span>\n\n         the ascertainment of the truth and second that the\n         court should be furnished with the best available\n         science and not confined to such unsatisfactory\n         alternatives as presumptions and inferences. It\n         seems to me obvious that all the Lord Hodson\n         expressed in the passage that I have cited applies\n         with even greater force and logic in a later era. First\n         there have been huge scientific advances with the\n         arrival of DNA testing. Scientists no longer require\n         blood,   thus   removing   what   for   some    is   the\n         unbearable process of its extraction. Of even greater\n         importance is the abandonment of the legal concept\n         of legitimacy achieved by the Family Law Act, 1987.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\">                                           (emphasis supplied)\n\n      It was further observed that paternity of any child is to\n\n      be established by science and not by legal presumption\n\n      or inference or by a long and acrimonious trial.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"43471013\" id=\"span_13\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"159613381\" id=\"span_14\">13.   Subsequently, the Supreme Court in case of <a href=\"/doc/159613381/\" id=\"a_19\">Dipanwita\n\n      Roy v. Ronobroto Roy</a> (2015) 1 SCC 365                   has\n\n      reiterated the principles <a href=\"/doc/159613381/\" id=\"a_20\">laid down in</a> case of <a href=\"/doc/43471013/\" id=\"a_21\">Bhabani\n\n      Prasad Jena v.

A similar issue case to be adjudicated\n             upon by this Court in <a href=\"/doc/43471013/\" id=\"a_22\">Bhabani Prasad Jena v.\n             Orissa State Commission</a> for Women, wherein\n             this Court held as under :</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">                  21. In a matter where paternity of a child is\n             in issue before the court, the use of DNA test is\n             an extremely delicate and sensitive aspect. One\n             view is that when modern science gives the\n             means of ascertaining the paternity of a child,\n             there should not be any hesitation to use those\n             means whenever the occasion requires. The\n             other view is that the court must be reluctant in\n             the use of such scientific advances and tools\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                      9</span>\n\nwhich result in invasion of right to privacy of an\nindividual and may not only be prejudicial to the\nrights of the parties but may have devastating\neffect on the child. Sometimes the result of such\nscientific test may bastardise an innocent child\neven though his mother and her spouse were\nliving together during the time of conception.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">      22. In our view, when there is apparent\nconflict between the right to privacy of a person\nnot    to   submit       himself forcibly    to   medical\nexamination and duty of the court to reach the\ntruth, the court must exercise its discretion only\nafter balancing the interests of the parties and\non due consideration whether for a just decision\nin the matter, DNA test is eminently needed.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_17\">DNA test in a matter relating to paternity of a\nchild should not be directed by the court as a\nmatter of course or in a routine manner,\nwhenever such a request is made. The court has\nto     consider       diverse      aspects        including\npresumption under <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_23\">section 112</a> of the Evidence\nAct; pros and cons of such order and the test of\n&#x27;eminent need&#x27; whether it is not possible for the\ncourt to reach the truth without use of such test.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\">      23. There is no conflict in the two decisions\nof this Court, namely, Goutam Kundu v. State of\nW.P.

In Goutam Kundu\n[(1993) 3 SCC 418], it has been laid down that\ncourts in India cannot order blood test as a\nmatter of course and such prayers cannot be\ngranted to have roving inquiry; there must be\nstrong prima facie case and the court must\ncarefully examine as to what would be the\nconsequence of ordering the blood test. In\nSharda [2003 (4) SCC 493] while concluding that\na matrimonial court has power to order a person\nto undergo a medical test, it was reiterated that\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                                10</span>\n\n           the court should exercise such a power if the\n           applicant has a strong prima facie case and\n           there is sufficient material before the court.\n           Obviously, therefore, any order for DNA test can\n           be given by the court only if a strong prima facie\n           case is made out for such a course.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_20\">   Therefore, what is the principle emerges that depending\n\n   on the facts and circumstances of the case, it would be\n\n   permissible for a Court to direct the holding of a DNA\n\n   examination      to   determine     the   veracity    of   the\n\n   allegations, if it was eminently needed.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"159613381\" id=\"span_18\">14.

The Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/139951018/\" id=\"a_29\">Nandlal\n\n   Wasudeo Badwaik v. Lata Nandlal Badwaik</a> AIR\n\n   2014 SC 932 has categorically held that in deciding the\n\n   paternity of the child, DNA test prevails over conclusive\n\n   proof of <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_30\">section 112</a> of the Act. For the sake of brevity,\n\n   paras 17 and 18 AIR is reproduced hereunder :</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">                       &quot;17. We may remember that <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_31\">Section\n             112</a> of the Evidence Act was enacted at the\n             time when the modern scientific advancement\n             and DNA test were not even in contemplation\n             of the Legislature. The result of DNA test is\n             said to be scientifically accurate.         Although\n             <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_32\">section     112</a>     raises   a   presumption       of\n             conclusive    proof    on    satisfaction    of   the\n             conditions enumerated therein but the same\n             is rebuttable.      The presumption may afford\n             legitimate means of arriving at an affirmative\n             legal conclusion.      While the truth or fact is\n             known, in our opinion, there is no need or\n             room for any presumption.         Where there is\n             evidence to the contrary, the presumption is\n             rebuttable and must yield to proof. Interest of\n             justice is best served by ascertaining the truth\n             and the court should be furnished with the\n             best available science and may not be left to\n             bank upon presumptions, unless science has\n             no answer to the facts in issue.             In our\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">                              12</span>\n\n              opinion, when there is a conflict between a\n              conclusive proof envisaged under law and a\n              proof     based      on    scientific   advancement\n              accepted by the world community to be\n              correct, the latter must prevail over the\n              former.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">              18.       We must understand the distinction\n              between a legal fiction and the presumption of\n              a fact.    Legal fiction assumes existence of a\n              fact which may not really exist. However,\n              presumption       of       a   fact     depends   on\n              circumstances. Those circumstances logically\n              would lead to the fact sought to be presumed.\n              <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 112</a> of the Evidence Act does not\n              create a legal            friction but provides for\n              presumption.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_23\">16. Therefore, we are conscious of the fact that under\n\n   <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_34\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution the wife has all the right to\n\n   refuse the order of the Court to undergo DNA test.\n\n   However, such refusal is required to be determined by\n\n   the Court by drawing a presumption in terms of <a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_35\">Section\n\n   114</a> illustration (h) thereof.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_24\">17. During the course of hearing, it is stated at Bar           a\n\n   divorce case has been filed by the husband which is\n\n   pending adjudication before the Family Court, Bemetara.\n\n   This fact cannot be over-looked that the ground which\n\n   has been raised by the husband would have a genesis to\n\n   the dispute between the wife and husband.              The DNA\n\n   report (Ex.D-1) which was produced by the husband in\n\n   this case shall not be admissible for the reason that it is\n\n   not clear as to who was the author of document and in\n\n   absence of evidence whose DNA test that pertains is\n\n   also not clear. Therefore, it         cannot be accepted and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">                                    13</span>\n\n         used against the child.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\">      18.

The parties shall\n\n         appear before the Family Court as and when the case of\n\n         divorce was fixed. The records of the court below be\n\n         sent back. The Family Court shall further proceed to\n\n         decide the case in terms of the order passed on\n\n         31.07.2018 as also the observation made by this Court\n\n         in order dated 09.07.2021 passed in WP No.17/2021\n\n         along with the further observation made in the foregoing\n\n         paragraphs of the instant order.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_26\">      19.
