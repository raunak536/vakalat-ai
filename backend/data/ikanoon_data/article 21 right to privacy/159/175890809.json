The petitioner was posted as SDO, Sub-Division Badali\n\nAla Singh, P.S.P.C.L, District Fatehgarh Sahib. A complaint was filed by\n\nInderjit Singh alleging that bribe of Rs.10,000/- was demanded by the\n\npetitioner for transfer of electricity connection of motor. The deal was struck\n\nfor Rs.8000/-. On complaint, a trap was laid. The petitioner was apprehended\n\nred handed. As per the case set up, a voice recorder with memory card was\n\nhanded over to the complainant for recording the conversation. The petitioner\n\nwas arrested on 8.4.2019, he remained in remand of Vigilance Department for\n\ntwo days and thereafter in judicial custody for a month. On presentation of\n\n                                        1 of 11\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                     ::: Downloaded on - 03-09-2022 23:57:46 :::</span>\n CRM-M-39718 of 2022 (O&amp;M)                                             -2-\n\nchallan, the charges were framed.

The contention is that\n\nthere is delay in filing application as no voice sample was taken when the\n\npetitioner was in custody. It is further argued that C.D. was prepared using a\n\nlaptop and memory card of the voice recorder.

Despite unanimity amongst the learned Judges hearing the\n            appeal on the first question on which the learned counsel for the\n            appellant has also not laid much stress it would be appropriate to\n            make the discussions complete to answer the question on the\n            strength of the test <a href=\"/doc/1626264/\" id=\"a_8\">laid down by</a> this Court in <a href=\"/doc/1626264/\" id=\"a_9\">State of Bombay v.\n            Kathi Kalu Oghad</a> (supra). Speaking on behalf of the majority\n            the then learned Chief Justice B.P. Sinha was of the view that the\n            prohibition contemplated by the constitutional provision\n            contained in <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_10\">Article 20(3)</a> would come in only in cases of\n            testimony of an accused which are self-incriminatory or of a\n            character which has the tendency of incriminating the accused\n            himself. The issue in the case was with regard to specimen\n            writings taken from the accused for comparison with other\n            writings in order to determine the culpability of the accused and\n            whether such a course of action was prohibited under <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_11\">Article\n            20(3)</a> of the Constitution. The following observations of the then\n            Chief Justice B.P. Sinha would be apt for recollection as the\n            same conclusively determines the first question arising. The\n            same, therefore, is extracted below:</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">                   &quot;(11)..........It is well-established that clause (3) of <a href=\"/doc/655638/\" id=\"a_12\">Article\n                   20</a> is directed against self-incrimination by an accused\n                   person. Self-Incrimination must mean conveying\n                   information based upon the personal knowledge of the\n                   person giving the information and cannot include merely\n                   the mechanical process of producing documents in court\n                   which may throw a light on any of the points in\n                   controversy, but which do not contain any statement of the\n                   accused based on his personal knowledge..........\n                   (12) In order that a testimony by an accused person may\n                   be said to have been self-incriminatory, the compulsion of\n                   which comes within the prohibition of the constitutional\n                   provision, it must be of such a character that by itself it\n                   should have the tendency of incriminating the accused, if\n                   not also of actually doing so. In other words, it should be a\n                   statement which makes the case against the accused person\n                   at least probable, considered by itself. A specimen\n                   handwriting or signature or finger impressions by\n                   themselves are no testimony at all, being wholly\n                   innocuous, because they are unchangeable; except, in rare\n                   cases where the ridges of the fingers or the style of writing\n                   have been tampered with.

We may hasten to add that Section 65B does not speak of\n            the stage at which such certificate must be furnished to the\n            Court. In Anvar P.V. (supra), this Court did observe that such\n            certificate must accompany the electronic record when the same\n            is produced in evidence. We may only add that this is so in cases\n            where such certificate could be procured by the person seeking\n            to rely upon an electronic record. However, in cases where\n            either a defective certificate is given, or in cases where such\n            certificate has been demanded and is not given by the concerned\n            person, the Judge conducting the trial must summon the\n            person/persons referred to in <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 65B(4)</a> of the Evidence Act,\n            and require that such certificate be given by such\n            person/persons. This, the trial Judge ought to do when the\n            electronic record is produced in evidence before him without the\n            requisite certificate in the circumstances aforementioned. This\n            is, of course, subject to discretion being exercised in civil cases\n            in accordance with law, and in accordance with the\n            requirements of justice on the facts of each case. When it comes\n            to criminal trials, it is important to keep in mind the general\n            principle that the accused must be supplied all documents that\n            the prosecution seeks to rely upon before commencement of the\n            trial, under the relevant sections of the Cr.P.C.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">            51. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"119431472\" id=\"span_16\">In a recent judgment, a Division Bench of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/119431472/\" id=\"a_32\">State\n            of Karnataka v.

Having regard to the above principle of law, the\n                    High Court erred in coming to the conclusion that\n                    the failure to produce a certificate under <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_35\">Section\n                    65B(4)</a> of the Evidence Act at the stage when the\n                    charge-sheet was filed was fatal to the prosecution.\n                    The need for production of such a certificate would\n                    arise when the electronic record is sought to be\n                    produced in evidence at the trial. It is at that stage\n                    that the necessity of the production of the certificate\n                    would arise.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_25\">              52. It is pertinent to recollect that the stage of admitting\n              documentary evidence in a criminal trial is the filing of the\n              charge-sheet. When a criminal court summons the accused\n              to stand trial, copies of all documents which are entered in\n              the charge-sheet/final report have to be given to the\n              accused. <a href=\"/doc/1613898/\" id=\"a_36\">section 207</a> of the CrPC, 1973 which reads as\n              follows, is mandatory. Therefore, the electronic evidence,\n              i.e. The computer output, has to be furnished at the latest\n              before the trial begins. The reason is not far to seek; this\n              gives the accused a fair chance to prepare and defend the\n              charges levelled against him during the trial. The general\n              principle in criminal proceedings therefore, is to supply to\n              the accused all documents that the prosecution seeks to\n              rely upon before the commencement of the trial. The\n              requirement of such full disclosure is an extremely\n              valuable right and an essential feature of the right to a fair\n              trial as it enables the accused to prepare for the trial\n              before its commencement.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\">              <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"924107\" id=\"span_20\">53. In a criminal trial, it is assumed that the investigation\n              is completed and the prosecution has, as such, concretised\n              its case against an accused before commencement of the\n              trial. It is further settled law that the prosecution ought not\n              to be allowed to fill up any lacunae during a trial. As\n              recognised by this Court in <a href=\"/doc/924107/\" id=\"a_37\">Central Bureau of\n              Investigation v. R.S. Pai</a> (2002) 5 SCC 82 : 2002(2) RCR\n              (Criminal) 536, the only exception to this general rule is if\n              the prosecution had `mistakenly&#x27; not filed a document, the\n              said document can be allowed to be placed on record. The\n              Court held as follows:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">                      &quot;7. From the aforesaid sub-sections, it is apparent\n                      that normally, the investigating officer is required to\n                      produce all the relevant documents at the time of\n                      submitting the charge-sheet. At the same time, as\n                      there is no specific prohibition, it cannot be held\n                      that the additional documents cannot be produced\n                      subsequently. If some mistake is committed in not\n                      producing the relevant documents at the time of\n                      submitting the report or the charge-sheet, it is\n\n                               8 of 11\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">            ::: Downloaded on - 03-09-2022 23:57:47 :::</span>\n CRM-M-39718 of 2022 (O&amp;M)                                          -9-\n\n                    always open to the investigating officer to produce\n                    the same with the permission of the court.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_27\">              54. Therefore, in terms of general procedure, the\n              prosecution is obligated to supply all documents upon\n              which reliance may be placed to an accused before\n              commencement of the trial. Thus, the exercise of power by\n              the courts in criminal trials in permitting evidence to be\n              filed at a later stage should not result in serious or\n              irreversible prejudice to the accused. A balancing exercise\n              in respect of the rights of parties has to be carried out by\n              the court, in examining any application by the prosecution\n              under sections 91 or 311 of the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_38\">CrPC</a>, 1973 or <a href=\"/doc/302809/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 165</a>\n              of the Evidence Act. Depending on the facts of each case,\n              and the Court exercising discretion after seeing that the\n              accused is not prejudiced by want of a fair trial, the Court\n              may in appropriate cases allow the prosecution to produce\n              such certificate at a later point in time. If it is the accused\n              who desires to produce the requisite certificate as part of\n              his defence, this again will depend upon the justice of the\n              case - discretion to be exercised by the Court in\n              accordance with law.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\">              <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"117357116\" id=\"span_22\">55.
