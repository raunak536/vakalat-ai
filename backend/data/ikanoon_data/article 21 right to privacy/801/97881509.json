But the language employed in the FIR is shocking, as it\n                       is, more a case of victim blaming. Even at the time of receiving\n                       complaint, counselling must have been provided by the\n                       officials concerned, so as to understand the clear picture about\n                       the incident in order to eliminate the trauma already caused to\n                       the victim girl by the accused person. The complaint and the\n                       FIR could have been drafted in such a way as to protect the\n                       dignity of the victim. It is the duty of the Police official\n                       receiving the complaint to assist the victim by employing a\n                       language, which does not infringe her right to dignity. Rather\n                       using words/phrases, insinuating the woman&#x27;s character and\n                       berating her dignity is uncalled for. This could have been\n                       avoided by appropriate choice of words without violating her\n                       right to dignity\n                       ............\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">                                  23.
