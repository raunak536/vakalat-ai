JUSTICE MUKTA GUPTA\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">1.      The Petitioner is a 12 year old victim in case FIR No. 04/2009 under\n<a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 376</a>/<a href=\"/doc/1243353/\" id=\"a_2\">342</a> IPC registered at PS Neb Sarai. On registration of FIR, an\ninquiry for age determination of Respondent No.2 was conducted and\nRespondent No.2 was found to be juvenile at the time of committing the\nalleged offence. Thus, an enquiry was conducted by the Juvenile Justice\nBoard-II. The proceedings in the inquiry qua Respondent No.2 culminated\non 8th July, 2011, however the Petitioner is not aware of its final outcome.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">The Petitioner was orally informed that Respondent No.2 was found to have\ncommitted the offence and was directed to be placed in the special home for\nthe period he had already undergone, which, according to the Petitioner, is\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">Crl.Rev.P. 356/2011                                             Page 1 of 17</span>\n around 2 to 3 months. The Petitioner filed an application before the Juvenile\nJustice Board seeking certified copy of the order dated 8 th July, 2011 so that\nshe could exercise her right of appeal/ revision against the said order.\nLearned Juvenile Justice Board vide impugned order dated 11 th July, 2011\ndeclined the request of the Petitioner to give a certified copy of the order\ndated 8th July, 2011 in view of the fundamental principles laid down in the\n<a href=\"/doc/148942/\" id=\"a_3\">Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection) Act, 2000</a> as amended in 2006 and the\nDelhi Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Rules, 2009 (in\nshort „the <a href=\"/doc/148942/\" id=\"a_4\">JJ Act</a>‟ and „the JJ Rules‟ respectively). Thus, the Petitioner is\nbefore this Court by way of the present revision petition filed under <a href=\"/doc/1475229/\" id=\"a_5\">Section\n53</a> of the JJ Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_5\">2.      Learned counsel for the Petitioner contends that <a href=\"/doc/1183186/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 21</a> of the JJ\nAct prohibits publication of any report of an inquiry disclosing the name,\naddress or school or any other particulars calculated to lead to the\nidentification regarding a juvenile in conflict with law or a child in need of\ncare and protection in any newspaper, magazine, news-sheet or visual media.\nSub-<a href=\"/doc/555852/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 2</a> to <a href=\"/doc/1183186/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 21</a> prescribed that any person who contravenes the\nprovisions of sub-section (1) shall be liable to a penalty which may extend to\ntwenty five thousand rupees. Learned counsel for the Petitioner contends\nthat the prohibition of publication to keep the confidentiality of a juvenile is\nnot a bar in providing of the certified copy of inquiry to a victim/aggrieved\nperson, who has a fundamental right to pursue the legal remedies available to\nher. Even <a href=\"/doc/804653/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 51</a> of the JJ Act only directs that the report of the\nprobation officer or social worker considered by the competent authority\nshall be treated as confidential.    Further Rule 3(2)(XI) of the JJ Rules\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">Crl.Rev.P. 356/2011                                              Page 2 of 17</span>\n provides that the right of privacy and confidentiality shall be protected by all\nmeans and through all the stages of proceedings. According to the learned\ncounsel for the Petitioner privacy and confidentiality provided under the sub-\nrule does not take away the statutory right of the Petitioner to avail of her\nlegal remedies, as in the absence of the impugned judgment, the Petitioner\ncannot even decide as to what remedy, if any, is available and whether she\nhas to avail the said remedy. According to the learned counsel, even Rule 99\nof JJ Rules which provides that the records or documents in respect of\njuvenile in conflict with law or child shall be kept in safe custody for a\nperiod of 7 years and no longer, and thereafter be destroyed, does not bar the\nsame to be given to an aggrieved party. The provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/148942/\" id=\"a_10\">JJ Act</a> relating\nto appeals and revision i.e. <a href=\"/doc/655003/\" id=\"a_11\">Sections 52</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1475229/\" id=\"a_12\">53</a> of JJ Act would become\nredundant in the absence of the copy of the order being available to the\naggrieved party. Further <a href=\"/doc/768975/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 54</a> of the JJ Act provides that while holding\nany inquiry appeal or revision proceedings under this Act, the procedure as\nfar as practicable applied will be in accordance with the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_14\">Code of Criminal\nProcedure</a>, 1973. Thus, in accordance with <a href=\"/doc/962373/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 363</a> Cr.P.C. a copy of\nthe judgment is required to be provided to the Petitioner.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_6\">3.      According to the learned counsel for the Petitioner, the decision of the\nJuvenile Justice Board cannot be the final step in the legal hierarchy and the\nrights available to a victim, who is also a minor, cannot be made nugatory. It\nis submitted that JJ Rules cannot override the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/148942/\" id=\"a_16\">JJ Act</a> wherein\nno prohibition is laid down to supplying of the copy of the order to the\nvictim/ aggrieved person. <a href=\"/doc/148942/\" id=\"a_17\">The Act</a> does not provide for the confidentiality of\nthe order or judgment of the Court. <a href=\"/doc/655003/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 52</a> JJ Act bars only an appeal\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">Crl.Rev.P. 356/2011                                               Page 3 of 17</span>\n against acquittal and appeals against all other orders are permitted. Thus, a\nperson aggrieved of the orders passed for rehabilitation of the juvenile in\nconflict with law can file an appeal before the Court of Sessions and\nthereafter a revision petition before the High Court. <a href=\"/doc/1475229/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 53</a> JJ Act\nenables this Court to examine the legality or propriety of the orders passed\nby the Juvenile Justice Board. <a href=\"/doc/1448957/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 15</a> of the JJ Act provides for the order\nthat may be passed regarding juvenile.        As per the proviso to <a href=\"/doc/131113333/\" id=\"a_21\">Section\n15(1)(g)</a> the Board for the reasons to be recorded, if it is satisfied that having\nregard to the nature of the offence and circumstances of the case, it is\nexpedient so to do, can reduce the period of stay to such period as it thinks\nfit. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"77966\" id=\"span_4\">Thus, in the present case, as informed, since the period of stay at special\nhome has been reduced to the period undergone, it has to be for the reasons\nrecorded in writing. The Petitioner being the aggrieved party has every right\nto know the said reasons and challenge the same. Further the reasons being\njusticiable are subject to review/ revision by a Superior Court. Relying upon\n<a href=\"/doc/77966/\" id=\"a_22\">Krishan Kumar Vs. State of Rajasthan &amp; Ors.</a> AIR 1992 SC 1789 it is\ncontended that the legislature will not take away from one hand what it gave\nwith the other. Thus, the principle of harmonious construction should be\napplied and the Rules relating to privacy and confidentiality cannot be used\nto make the right of appeal and revision nugatory. Further in case the\nJuvenile Justice Board has come to the conclusion that the juvenile in\nconflict with law has been found to have committed a lesser offence, then the\nPetitioner herein has a right to file a statutory appeal under <a href=\"/doc/81939/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 372</a>\nCr.P.C. In any case, a revision against the propriety and legality of the order\nis maintainable before this Court. It is contended that the Act makes no\ndistinction between providing of a final order or interim order. Though\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">Crl.Rev.P. 356/2011                                               Page 4 of 17</span>\n orders on age determination are being provided by the learned Juvenile\nJustice Board, however the final judgments are not being provided to the\nvictim and thus distinction is being made by the Juvenile Justice Boards,\nwhich distinction is not provided in the Act. Thus, the petition be allowed\nand the Juvenile Justice Board be directed to supply the Petitioner certified\ncopy of the order dated 8th July, 2011 so that the Petitioner can avail of the\nlegal remedies as per law.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_7\">4.      Learned counsel for the State on the other hand contends that the\nwords &quot;any person aggrieved&quot; in <a href=\"/doc/655003/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 52</a> JJ Act are wide enough to\ninclude State as well as the victim and thus the statutory remedy of filing an\nappeal except in the case of an acquittal is provided to a person aggrieved.\n<a href=\"/doc/1183186/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 21</a> of the JJ Act is akin to <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 227A</a> of the Cr.P.C. In the present\ncase, there is no challenge to vires of the JJ Rules and thus the contention\nthat Rule 3 (2) (XI) and 99 over-ride <a href=\"/doc/1183186/\" id=\"a_27\">Sections 21</a> and <a href=\"/doc/804653/\" id=\"a_28\">51</a> of the JJ Act is\nmisconceived. It is further contended that the concept of proportionality of\nthe sentence has no application while dealing with the juvenile, as after\nholding that the juvenile has committed an offence, the only consideration\nbefore the Juvenile Justice Board is the measure to be adopted to reform and\nrehabilitate the juvenile in conflict with law. Relying upon <a href=\"/doc/6792993/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 54(2)</a> JJ\nAct it is stated that the words used in the Section are „as far as practicable‟\ni.e. the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_30\">Cr.P.C</a>. would apply as far as practicable. Thus, no\nprovision of the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_31\">Cr.P.C</a>., which is not practically possible to be followed in\nview of the specific provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/148942/\" id=\"a_32\">JJ Act</a> can be invoked. However, a\nclear statutory right of an appeal being given to &quot;any aggrieved person&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"699436\" id=\"span_6\">which includes the State and the victim and a suo-moto or on an application,\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">Crl.Rev.P. 356/2011                                             Page 5 of 17</span>\n power of revision vested in this Court, is a clear case of casus omisus in the\nStatute. Thus, this Court should balance the public interest of maintaining\nthe secrecy of the record of juvenile on the one hand and on the other ensure\nthat the right of appeal provided in the Statute is meaningful and is not\nrendered redundant. In this regard reference is made to Rule 21 of the\nBeijing Rules which provides &quot;access to record shall be limited to persons\ndirectly concerned with the disposition of the case at hand or other duly\nauthorized person&quot;. A victim is included in the expression &quot;persons directly\nconcerned with the disposition of the case in hand&quot;. Further the victim is\nalso covered under <a href=\"/doc/655003/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 52</a> which refers to &quot;any person aggrieved&quot;. It is\nthus prayed that in the light of apparent conflict between the\nabovementioned provisions relating to appellate proceedings and the public\ninterest with regard to confidentiality, this Court will lay down guidelines\nusing the doctrine of casus omisus as to how a victim can gain access to the\norders passed by the Juvenile Justice Board and how an appeal or revision\nmay be preferred in such matters. Relying upon <a href=\"/doc/699436/\" id=\"a_34\">Maulavi Hussein Haji\nAbraham Umarji Vs. State of Gujarat and Anr.</a> (2004) 6 SCC 672 it is\ncontended that the Court will intervene to reconcile these two rights.\nEmphasis is also laid on <a href=\"/doc/596629/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 19(2)</a> JJ Act which directs the Board to\nmaintain the record till the disposal of the appeal or revision or the\nreasonable period.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_8\">5.      Learned counsel for Respondent No.2 on the other hand contends that\nRespondent No.2 has been found to have committed the offence by the\nlearned Juvenile Justice Board. According to him, even if Respondent No.2\nwas not found to have committed the offence alleged, the Petitioner had no\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">Crl.Rev.P. 356/2011                                             Page 6 of 17</span>\n right to file an appeal against acquittal. The right to appeal is only available\nto the juvenile in conflict with law as he is the only &quot;person aggrieved&quot;.\nAccording to learned counsel, the words &quot;any person aggrieved&quot; in <a href=\"/doc/655003/\" id=\"a_36\">Section\n52</a> of the JJ Act only relate to a juvenile in conflict with law as no other\nperson is aggrieved by the order passed by the Juvenile Justice Board.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_9\">6.      I have heard learned counsel for the parties. The issues that arise for\nconsideration are whether a victim has a right to challenge an order of the\nJuvenile Justice Board before a Superior Court by way of an appeal or a\nrevision and therefore a right to get a copy of the said order under <a href=\"/doc/1448957/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 15</a>\nof the JJ Act. Before adverting to the relevant provisions of the Act, it\nwould be appropriate to note the objects of the <a href=\"/doc/148942/\" id=\"a_38\">JJ Act</a> and the perspective in\nwhich the Act was enacted. <a href=\"/doc/148942/\" id=\"a_39\">The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of\nChildren) Act, 2000</a> was a re-enactment of the then existing law, the <a href=\"/doc/49588121/\" id=\"a_40\">Juvenile\nJustice Act, 1986</a> regulating the juveniles bearing in mind the standards\nprescribed in the Convention on the Rights of the Child, United Nations\nStandard Minimum Rules for the Administration of Justice, 1985 (The\nBeijing Rules), the United Nations Rules for the Protection of Juvenile\nDeprived of Their Liberty (1990) and other relevant international\ninstruments. On 11th December, 1992 India ratified the Convention on the\nRights of the Child (in short „the Convention‟) in the United Nations General\nAssembly Resolution 44/25 dated 20th November, 1989 which prescribes a\nset of standards to be adhered to in order to secure the best interest of the\nChild. The Convention aimed at social re-integration of juveniles without\nresorting to judicial proceedings. The Convention requires that all parties to\nthe Convention shall see that the laws and rules of the country should\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">Crl.Rev.P. 356/2011                                              Page 7 of 17</span>\n correspond to the Convention and that they shall undertake all appropriate\nmeasures for the practical implementation of the said rights.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_10\">7.      The United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Administration\nof Juvenile Justice, 1985 (hereinafter called as „The Beijing Rules‟) aim to\nfurther the well-being of a juvenile without the least possible intervention by\njudicial bodies. The Rules aim to create an atmosphere of reform and seek\nto help a juvenile develop free from crime and delinquency. One of the\nfundamental guiding principle behind United Nations Rules for the\nProtection of the Juveniles Deprived of their liberty (1990) is:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">        &quot;The fundamental guiding principle behind the United Nations\n        Rules for the Protection of Juveniles Deprived of their Liberty\n        (1990) (hereinafter &quot;the Rules&quot;) is that the &quot;placement of a\n        juvenile in an institution should always be a disposition of last\n        resort and for the minimum necessary period&quot; and further adds\n        that &quot;because of their high vulnerability, juveniles deprived of\n        their liberty require special attention and protection and that\n        their rights and well-being should be guaranteed during and\n        after the period when they are deprived of their liberty.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_11\">8.      The Beijing Rules provide for the protection of privacy of the\njuveniles which have been incorporated in the JJ Rules. The relevant Rules\nare as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">        &quot;6.     Scope of discretion\n        6.1 In view of the varying special needs of juveniles as well\n        as the variety of measures available, appropriate scope for\n        discretion shall be allowed at all stages of proceedings and at\n        the different levels of juvenile justice administration, including\n        investigation, prosecution, adjudication and the follow-up of\n        dispositions.\n</blockquote>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">Crl.Rev.P. 356/2011                                                Page 8 of 17</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">         6.2 Efforts shall be made, however, to ensure sufficient\n        accountability at all stages and levels in the exercise of any\n        such discretion.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">        6.3 Those who exercise discretion shall be specially qualified\n        or trained to exercise it judiciously and in accordance with their\n        functions and mandates.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">        8.

In consonance with the Beijing Rules, the JJ Act and JJ Rules provide\n\nfor a number of provisions dealing with the confidentiality of the juvenile in\n\nconflict with law.

However, it may be noted that\nwhile providing for utmost confidentiality and privacy and minimizing the\njudicial intervention, the <a href=\"/doc/148942/\" id=\"a_48\">Conventions and the JJ Act</a> did not take away the\nright of appeal/revision permitted to an aggrieved person under the <a href=\"/doc/148942/\" id=\"a_49\">JJ Act</a>.\nThe relevant provisions dealing with the appeals and revision under the <a href=\"/doc/148942/\" id=\"a_50\">JJ\nAct</a> are as under:\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">Crl.Rev.P. 356/2011                                               Page 13 of 17</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">         &quot;2 .

Though the JJ Act and the Conventions provide for minimum possible\njudicial intervention, however at the same time it cannot be said that an order\npassed by the Juvenile Justice Board shall be final and no appeal or revision\nagainst it would lie before the superior Courts. This would be contrary to the\nfundamental principle of right of access to justice.      Thus, this Court is\nrequired to harmoniously construe the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/148942/\" id=\"a_54\">JJ Act</a> and JJ Rules\nkeeping in mind the parallel conflicting fundamental principles and rights. A\nperusal of <a href=\"/doc/655003/\" id=\"a_55\">Section 52</a> of the JJ Act shows that any person aggrieved by an\norder made by a competent authority under the <a href=\"/doc/148942/\" id=\"a_56\">JJ Act</a> can prefer an appeal to\nthe Court of Session within 30 days. However, no such appeal shall lie from\nan order of acquittal made by the Board in respect of a juvenile alleged to\nhave committed an offence. Thereby meaning that except in the case of an\norder of acquittal, an appeal by any aggrieved person would lie before a\nCourt of Sessions. Learned counsel for Respondent No.2 has strenuously\ncontended that the word „aggrieved person‟ in <a href=\"/doc/655003/\" id=\"a_57\">Section 52</a> would mean a\n&quot;juvenile in conflict with law&quot; who has been found to have committed an\noffence by the Board and no other person. Such a restrictive meaning to the\nwords &quot;aggrieved person&quot; cannot be given.          If the Legislature had so\nintended, it would have then used the words &quot;juvenile in conflict with law&quot;\n</p>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">Crl.Rev.P. 356/2011                                              Page 15 of 17</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\"> and not &quot;any person aggrieved&quot;. However, at the same time it may be noted\nthat the right of appeal is limited as no appeal against an acquittal lies. Thus,\nthe other orders on which the victim or the State may have the grievance like\nan order declaring a person juvenile, the aggrieved person would be entitled\nto copy of the order for challenge before the Superior Court.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_34\">14.     It may be noted that proportionality of the sentence is not known to\n<a href=\"/doc/49588121/\" id=\"a_58\">Juvenile Justice Act</a> as no sentence is provided to the juvenile in conflict\nwith law even on return of finding commission of offence. The orders\npassed under <a href=\"/doc/1448957/\" id=\"a_59\">Section 15</a> of the JJ Act are for the reformation and\nrehabilitation of the juvenile. However, in case the measures adopted for the\nrehabilitation and reformation of the juvenile adversely affects the interest of\nthe victim or is not beneficial to the betterment of the juvenile then it cannot\nbe said that the victim or the State to a limited extent have no remedy\navailable to them. In such a situation, they can certainly approach the Court\nof Sessions in its appellate powers or the High Court in its power under\n<a href=\"/doc/1331149/\" id=\"a_60\">Article 227</a> of the Constitution and <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_61\">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C. for redressal of their\ngrievance. If that be the situation, then in those cases the victim or the State\nwould be entitled to approach the superior court, which will then call for the\nrecords of the Juvenile Justice Board and examine the legality and propriety\nof the order after giving due notice to juvenile through its guardian.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_35\">15.     Further while maintaining the complete confidentiality, the victim and\nthe State being a party to the proceeding would be entitled to know the final\noutcome. Thus, the Juvenile Justice Board is duty bound to inform the\noutcome of the inquiry to the victim and the State, besides the juvenile.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">Crl.Rev.P. 356/2011                                               Page 16 of 17</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_36\"> 16.     Applying the principles enumerated above to the facts of the present\ncase, it may be noted that the grievance of the Petitioner in the present case\nis that to the best of her knowledge Respondent No.2, though was held to\nhave committed the alleged offence yet has been directed to remain in the\nspecial home for the period undergone i.e. a period of two to three months.\nAs noted above, the concept of proportionality of sentence is unknown to the\n<a href=\"/doc/148942/\" id=\"a_62\">JJ Act</a>. In view of the fact that there is no indefeasible right of the Petitioner\nto file an appeal on the proportionality of sentence, I find no ground to direct\nthe Juvenile Justice Board to give a copy of the order dated 8 th July, 2011 to\nthe Petitioner herein.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_37\">17.
