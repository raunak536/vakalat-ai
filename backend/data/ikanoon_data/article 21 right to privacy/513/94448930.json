He had\n\n     approached this Court by fling Writ Petition No. 841 of\n\n     2018.       In     that   proceeding    a   letter     of     the     District\n\n     Superintendent of Police Ahmednagar was shown to the\n\n     Court and it was to the efect that the Sub Divisional\n\n     Police Oficer was appointed to make inquiry. In view of\n\n     the steps taken by the superior police oficers, Writ\n\n     Petition No.841of 2018 was disposed of by this Court.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">::: Uploaded on - 29/11/2019                     ::: Downloaded on - 30/11/2019 05:30:20 :::</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">                                         6        Cr WP 25 of 2019\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_9\">     5)               It is the contention of the petitioner that in the\n\n     aforesaid inquiry it revealed that the search of the house\n\n     of the petitioner was taken but there was no search\n\n     warrant.

It is his contention that the police oficers involved\n\n     in the house search could not have come together as they\n\n     were posted at diferent places for discharge of their\n\n     routine duties and everything in the action was illegal. It\n\n     is the contention of the petitioner that there is nothing\n\n     with the respondents to show that they had received any\n\n     information against the petitioner on that night or prior\n\n     to that night and the action taken had no basis. A copy of\n\n     the report prepared by the Superintendent of Police is\n\n     produced on the record and other documents like copy of\n\n     representation are also produced and the aforesaid reliefs\n\n     are claimed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_10\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_11\">     6)               The Superintendent of Police Ahmednagar has\n\n     fled reply afidavit.

He has contended that due to\n\n     such circumstance there was a probability that persons of\n\n     that local area were having fre arms and they were\n\n     involved in illegal activities and so action was taken by\n\n     police which was on the basis of secret information.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_12\">     7)                It is the contention of District Superintendent\n\n     of Police that, present petitioner is driver by occupation\n\n     and against him some crimes were registered prior to the\n\n     date of action though under <a href=\"/doc/1371604/\" id=\"a_2\">sections 304-A</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1270101/\" id=\"a_3\">279</a> of the\n\n     Indian Penal Code between years 2011 and 2015.

In the\n\n     case of Rehman (cited supra)          the Apex Court has laid\n\n     down that as the provision of <a href=\"/doc/232472/\" id=\"a_17\">section 165(1)</a> of the Cr.P.C.\n\n     is mandatory in nature, it should be strictly followed.\n\n     Thus, before entering a house, investigating oficer has to\n\n     specify in writing the things for which search is to be\n\n     made and also the ground of his belief that such things\n\n     would be found in the house which is to be searched. In\n\n     view of the wording of the provision it can be said that\n\n     the provision is not restricted to search of what is stolen\n\n     or believed to be stolen and it permits the police oficer to\n\n     make search for anything necessary for the purposes of\n\n     investigation into any ofence. Thus, on one hand the\n\n     provision enables police to take search of the house for\n\n     investigation of any crime, on the other, it becomes\n\n     mandatory for police to record reasons as the frst step\n\n     before entering the house.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_32\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_33\">     16)              Sub section (2) of <a href=\"/doc/996365/\" id=\"a_18\">section 165</a> of the Cr.P.C.\n\n     shows that police oficer taking action should be either\n\n     police oficer in charge of the police station or the\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">::: Uploaded on - 29/11/2019                ::: Downloaded on - 30/11/2019 05:30:20 :::</span>\n                                            15           Cr WP 25 of 2019\n\n     investigating oficer.

There is nothing\n\n     in the Arms Act and the Rules framed under that Act to\n\n     enable police to take such search by ignoring the\n\n     provision of section 165 of the Cr.P.C. This Court has also\n\n     gone through the provisions of the Maharashtra Police Act\n\n     to ascertain the powers of police oficer and this Act also\n\n     does not show that police can bypass the provision of\n\n     section 165 of the Cr.P.C.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_35\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">::: Uploaded on - 29/11/2019                      ::: Downloaded on - 30/11/2019 05:30:20 :::</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_36\">                                                 16        Cr WP 25 of 2019\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_37\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"127517806\" id=\"span_15\">18)              Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted\n\n     that taking house search illegally itself amounts to\n\n     infringement of privacy and such act is in breach of the\n\n     fundamental               rights   given   under     <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_24\">Article       21</a>      of    the\n\n     Constitution of India. In view of the aforesaid provision,\n\n     and as police oficers entered the house that too in night\n\n     time when he was sleeping with his family which included\n\n     two ladies and the issues, this Court holds that it was\n\n     intrusion into privacy. If such act is done illegally without\n\n     following the procedure which is contemplated in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_25\">Article\n\n     21</a> of the Constitution of India, the consequences follow. In\n\n     such a case, there cannot be defence that it was a mistake\n\n     on the part of the police oficers. On this point, learned\n\n     counsel for the petitioner has placed reliance on the case\n\n     reported as AIR 2017 SC 4161 (<a href=\"/doc/127517806/\" id=\"a_26\">Justice K.S. Puttaswamy v.\n\n     Union of India</a>). Facts and circumstances of each and\n\n     every case are always diferent. It needs to be ascertained\n\n     in every case as to whether the action of the oficers was\n\n     in breach of the fundamental rights given by provision like\n\n     <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_27\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India. If the Court comes\n\n     to conclusion that the action was not in accordance with\n\n     law, it was illegal the court is bound to give compensation.</span>\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">::: Uploaded on - 29/11/2019                         ::: Downloaded on - 30/11/2019 05:30:20 :::</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_38\">                                          17          Cr WP 25 of 2019\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_39\">     19)                In the present matter this Court had given\n\n     opportunity to the respondents to show that there was\n\n     secret information received by police on that night.\n\n     Though from the information, the informant&#x27;s name need\n\n     not be disclosed, it is necessary for police to create a\n\n     record        of    the   information   received.      Entry        of    such\n\n     information which involves commission of cognizable\n\n     ofence needs to be made in station diary. When police\n\n     oficers leave for action, they need to make an entry about\n\n     their movements in station diary. In the present matter the\n\n     record produced by the petitioner shows that most of the\n\n     respondents were assigned diferent duties at diferent\n\n     places on that night. All of them came together on that\n\n     night for this action but no writing is there in respect of\n\n     secret information and also about the compliance of\n\n     provision of <a href=\"/doc/996365/\" id=\"a_28\">section 165</a> of the Cr.P.C. It appears that\n\n     subsequent to taking the search some entry was made in\n\n     the station diary but such entry cannot be used to show\n\n     that there was compliance of provision of <a href=\"/doc/996365/\" id=\"a_29\">section 165</a> of\n\n     the Cr.P.C. This Court holds that the action of the police\n\n     oficers was illegal. This Court has no hesitation to hold\n\n     that the State is liable to pay compensation to the\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">::: Uploaded on - 29/11/2019                    ::: Downloaded on - 30/11/2019 05:30:20 :::</span>\n                                         18         Cr WP 25 of 2019\n\n     petitioner for such illegal action. That action of police was\n\n     not only the infringement into privacy but that action\n\n     defamed the entire family. If in the past some crimes were\n\n     registered against the petitioner for ofence of accidents\n\n     that cannot be considered to say that the petitioner had\n\n     criminal background when his occupation was driver.\n\n     Many times a driver faces such prosecution. So, the\n\n     defence of such nature taken by the respondents cannot\n\n     help them to show that they had reasonable ground to\n\n     take action against            the petitioner. There is other\n\n     probability like involvement of the rivals of the aforesaid\n\n     political leader. Thus there is possibility of mala fdes also\n\n     in the present matter. Considering the status of the\n\n     petitioner this Court holds that the respondents need to\n\n     pay at least Rs.25,000/- as compensation to the petitioner.\n\n     Initially that amount needs to be paid by the State and it\n\n     will be open to the State to recover the amount from the\n\n     concerned police oficers after fxing responsibly on them.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_40\">     20)              Granting of   other reliefs like prosecuting the\n\n     police oficers is not possible in the matter like present\n\n     one.

The facts of these two\n\n     reported cases are diferent. In view of the facts of those\n\n     cases it was held that the acts were not done in purported\n\n     exercise of the duty. In the case of Bhagwan Prasad\n\n     Srivastava (cited supra), the Apex Court has made it clear\n\n     that there must be reasonable connection between the\n\n     &quot;act&quot; and the discharge of oficial &quot;duty&quot;. The act must fall\n\n     within the scope and range of oficial duty of the public\n\n     servant concerned. It is observed that it is not &quot;duty&quot;\n\n     which requires examination as much as &quot;act&quot; because the\n\n     oficial act can be performed both in the discharge of the\n\n     oficial duty as well as in dereliction of it. There cannot be\n\n     dispute over the propositions made in the two cases. In\n\n     the present matter this Court has referred the provisions\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">::: Uploaded on - 29/11/2019               ::: Downloaded on - 30/11/2019 05:30:20 :::</span>\n                                       22         Cr WP 25 of 2019\n\n     of <a href=\"/doc/996365/\" id=\"a_38\">sections 165</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1602278/\" id=\"a_39\">166</a> of the Cr.P.C. The house of the\n\n     petitioner is situated within local jurisdiction of the police\n\n     station of the respondents and it is their contention that\n\n     there was specifc information about illegal possession of\n\n     frearm against the petitioner and so search was taken. In\n\n     view of the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_40\">Cr.P.C</a>. quoted, it can be said\n\n     that search of the house premises was a part of oficial\n\n     duty.

Though search was without warrant the Apex\n\n     Court held that sanction for prosecution of            such police\n\n     oficer needs to be obtained under <a href=\"/doc/12704/\" id=\"a_44\">section 197</a> of the\n\n     Cr.P.C. In the second matter of Anjani Kumar similar\n\n     observations are made and it is observed that if there is\n\n     reasonable connection between the act and the discharge\n\n     of duty by public servant, the act would be &#x27;oficial&#x27; to\n\n     which <a href=\"/doc/12704/\" id=\"a_45\">section 197</a> of the Cr.P.C. would be applicable. On\n\n     that count the proceeding fled against the public servant\n\n     was quashed. In view of this position of law, this Court\n\n     holds that for the prosecution there is necessity of\n\n     sanction under <a href=\"/doc/12704/\" id=\"a_46\">section 197</a> of the Cr.P.C. In view of the\n\n     facts of the present matter this Court holds that no further\n\n     action like direction for prosecution of the police oficers\n\n     is warranted and giving of the compensation to the\n\n     petitioner would be suficient.
