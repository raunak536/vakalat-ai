The petitioner, who is the son of the deceased Bimla Shah who\nwas killed by respondent No.2 and his associate, has preferred this\nrevision petition against the order dated 4.7.2012 passed by the\nAdditional Sessions Judge, Saket Courts, New Delhi whereby the\norder passed by the Juvenile Justice Board on 11.5.2012, declaring the\nrespondent No.2 to be a juvenile was upheld. It has further been\nprayed on behalf of the petitioner to direct the Juvenile Justice Board\nto conduct re-inquiry regarding the age of respondent No.2 and allow\nhim to participate in the aforesaid inquiry.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">CRL.REV.P.362/2012                                            Page 1 of 20</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_2\"> 2.      The factual matrix of the case is as follows.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">3.      On 31.10.2011 a PCR call was received at Jangpura regarding\ntheft in a house at Jangpura Extension. On such information, local\npolice reached the spot and found the main entry gate of the house\nopen. The household articles were found scattered all over and it was\ndeciphered that the house had recently been ransacked. In the process,\nthe dead body of the mother of the petitioner was spotted. Smt.Bimla\nShah, aged about 80 years was found to be inside the bathroom of her\nhouse with her hands and mouth tied. Blood was oozing out of her\nmouth. Thus a case vide FIR No.317/2011 (P.S.Hazrat Nizamuddin)\ndated 31.10.2011 was instituted for the offence under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 302</a> of\nthe IPC.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">4.      During the course of investigation, the police, on coming to\nknow that the deceased was staying with a Nepali servant who was\nfound missing, made a search for him as he was suspected of having\ncommitted the offence. On a tip off, on 25.12.2011, the Nepali servant\n(respondent No.2) was apprehended along with his associate and they\nconfessed about their having committed the murder of Smt.Bimla\nShah. Respondent No.2 was sent to judicial custody.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">5.      While in judicial custody, the respondent No.2 preferred an\napplication seeking a declaration of his juvenility at the time of\noccurrence. Acting on such an application, the learned Additional\nSessions Judge, by order dated 28.4.2012, directed the IO of the case\nto produce respondent No.2 before the Juvenile Justice Board-II, Delhi\nGate.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">CRL.REV.P.362/2012                                           Page 2 of 20</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\"> 6.       The Juvenile Justice Board directed for conducting medical\ntest/ossification bone test of respondent No.2 in order to find out his\nactual age. Pursuant to such a direction, the bone ossification test was\nconducted at Safdarjung Hospital and a report dated 3.5.2012 was\ngiven which opined the age of the respondent No.2 between 18 to 19\nyears.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">7.       By order dated 11.5.2012 the Juvenile Justice Board, found the\nrespondent No.2 to be a juvenile and returned the finding that\nrespondent No.2 was less than 18 years of age on the date of\noccurrence. By the same order the respondent No.2 was directed to be\nshifted to a place of safety.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">8.       It would be relevant here to state that the police submitted\nchargesheet under <a href=\"/doc/1412034/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 173</a> of the Cr.P.C against the respondent\nNo.2 for offences punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_3\">Sections 302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/764237/\" id=\"a_4\">394</a>/<a href=\"/doc/812083/\" id=\"a_5\">411</a> and <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_6\">34</a> of\nthe IPC. On the respondent No.2 being declared a juvenile, he was\ntried by the Juvenile Justice Board and convicted under the aforesaid\nsections. Respondent No.2 had pleaded guilty and, therefore, he was\nsentenced for the period which he had remained in custody i.e six\nmonths. By order dated 7.7.2012 the Juvenile Justice Board directed\nthat respondent No.2 be deported to Nepal.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_9\">9.       The petitioner challenged the order dated 11.5.2012 passed by\nthe Juvenile Justice Board whereby the respondent No.2 was declared\na juvenile and was directed to be shifted to the place of safety. Though\n<a href=\"/doc/655003/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 52</a> of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children)\nAct, 2000 (hereinafter referred to as the &#x27;Act&#x27;) provides for filing of an\nappeal against the order passed by the Juvenile Justice Board, the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">CRL.REV.P.362/2012                                              Page 3 of 20</span>\n petitioner chose to file a revision before the Sessions Judge and which\nrevision petition was entertained as well. The learned Sessions Judge\nvide order dated 4.7.2012 dismissed the prayer of the petitioner.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_10\">10.    The petitioner took the plea that the Juvenile Justice Board did\nnot act in accordance with the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/196876035/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 7A</a> of the Act\nwhich mandates the Juvenile Justice Board to proceed in a specific\nmanner while dealing with an inquiry regarding to the age of a\njuvenile. Without asking for any other documents namely the birth\ncertificate or any document regarding school first attended, the\nJuvenile Justice Board, straightway, asked for a medical information\nand directed for the ossification test. The petitioner has also raised\nobjection with respect to the ossification test report which, in the\nestimation of the petitioner is incomplete as it does not contain the\nreport of teeth X-ray and further that the report is based on AP View\nonly and not lateral view. The challenge of the petitioner was\noverruled and the petition was dismissed vide order dated 4.7.2012.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_11\">11.    A prayer was made by the petitioner for obtaining certified copy\nof the order dated 7.7.2012 whereby the respondent No.2 was\nconvicted and sentenced for the period which he had undergone in\ncustody and also additionally made a prayer for inspecting the file of\nthe case. Both the prayers were refused by the Juvenile Justice Board\nvide order dated 10.7.2012. A reference has been made to the\naforesaid orders in the petition though no specific prayer has been\nmade to set aside the said order.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_12\">12.

From the bare reading of proviso to <a href=\"/doc/1475229/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 53</a> it becomes\nobvious that in exercise of its revisional jurisdiction, the High Court\ncannot pass any order which is prejudicial to any person without\naffording him a reasonable opportunity of being heard. A reference\nalso is required to be made to the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/768975/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 54</a> of the Act\nwhich prescribes the procedure to be followed while dealing with\ninquiries, appeals and revisions under the Act. <a href=\"/doc/768975/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 54</a> of the Act\nreads as hereunder:-\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_15\">      &quot;54.

From a reading of <a href=\"/doc/196876035/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 7A</a> what becomes very obvious is\nthat whenever a claim of juvenility is raised, an inquiry has to be made\nand such inquiry would take place by receiving evidence which would\nbe necessary but not an affidavit so as to determine the age of such\nperson. The receiving of evidence presupposes that the statement\ngiven in evidence would be subject to cross examination. The person\nwho would be aggrieved if an accused is declared to be a juvenile,\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">CRL.REV.P.362/2012                                              Page 7 of 20</span>\n would cross examine such evidence in an inquiry for determination of\nage. In that event also, non supply of records of the case or the\ncertified copy of the order whereby a person is declared juvenile\nwould make the provisions of appeal and revision otiose and\nmeaningless.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">18.

Apart from the above provisions, there can be no cavil on the\nproposition that except under exceptional circumstances the principle\nof affording hearing to the concerned party has to be applied in all\ncircumstances. It is a part of rules of natural justice and it is in\nconsonance with the basic dicta of fair play in action which demands\nthat before any prejudicial or adverse order is passed or action is taken\nagainst a person, he must be given an opportunity to be heard.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_33\">22.    This presupposes that any party which is aggrieved by any order\npassed by the Juvenile Justice Board, would be competent to maintain\nan appeal or revision as the case may be. Such remedies would\nbecome meaningless if the concerned person is not afforded and\nprovided with certified copies of the orders passed by the competent\nauthority or by the appellate or revisional Courts. Even if the <a href=\"/doc/148942/\" id=\"a_30\">Juvenile\nJustice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2000</a> is a beneficial\nlegislation, meant only for the purposes of providing safety and taking\ncare of the juveniles in conflict with law but a copy of the order cannot\nbe refused to a person who seeks to challenge the declaration of\njuvenility of a particular person.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_34\">23.    Thus the Juvenile Justice Board was in clear error in not\nproviding the certified copy of its order on the ground that the records\nwith respect to juveniles are required to be kept in strict confidence\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">CRL.REV.P.362/2012                                             Page 12 of 20</span>\n and in safe place so as not to be easily accessible. The Juvenile Justice\nBoard completely misdirected itself in saying that there was a\npossibility of the records being used against a juvenile and that would\nbe in breach of the confidentiality and right to privacy of the juvenile.\nThe prayer of the petitioner was refused on additional ground that the\njuvenile has already been released in the present matter.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_35\">24.    Thus the aforesaid orders of the Juvenile Justice Board cannot\nbe sustained and are set aside.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_36\">25.    Now to the basic issue regarding the finding of juvenility by the\nJuvenile Justice Board.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_37\">26.    Rule 12 of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of\nChildren) Rule, 2007 provides for the procedure to be followed in\ndetermination of the age. It reads as hereunder:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">       ―12.

In case exact assessment of the age cannot be\n       done, the Court or the Board or, as the case may be, the\n       Committee, for the reasons to be recorded by them, may,\n       if considered necessary, give benefit to the child or\n       juvenile by considering his/her age on lower side within\n       the margin of one year. and, while passing orders in such\n       case shall, after taking into consideration such evidence\n       as may be available, or the medical opinion, as the case\n       may be, record a finding in respect of his age and either\n       of the evidence specified in any of the clauses (a)(i), (ii),\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">       (iii) or in the absence whereof, clause (b) shall be the\n       conclusive proof of the age as regards such child or the\n       juvenile in conflict with law.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">       (4) If the age of a juvenile or child or the juvenile in\n       conflict with law is found to be below 18 years on the\n       date of offence, on the basis of any of the conclusive\n       proof specified in sub-rule (3), the court or the Board or\n       as the case may be the Committee shall in writing pass\n       an order stating the age and declaring the status of\n       juvenility or otherwise, for the purpose of the Act and\n       these rules and a copy of the order shall be given to such\n       juvenile or the person concerned.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">       (5) Save and except where, further inquiry or otherwise\n       is required, inter alia, in terms of <a href=\"/doc/196876035/\" id=\"a_31\">section 7A</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1375287/\" id=\"a_32\">section 64</a>\n       of the Act and these rules, no further inquiry shall be\n       conducted by the court or the Board after examining and\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">CRL.REV.P.362/2012                                               Page 14 of 20</span>\n        obtaining the certificate or any other documentary proof\n       referred to in sub-rule (3) of this rule. (6) The provisions\n       contained in this rule shall also apply to those disposed\n       off cases, where the status of juvenility has not been\n       determined in accordance with the provisions contained\n       in subrule(3) and the Act, requiring dispensation of the\n       sentence under the Act for passing appropriate order in\n       the interest of the juvenile in conflict with law.‖\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_38\">27.    Sub clause (3) of the aforesaid rule clearly mandates that while\nconducting an inquiry about the juvenility of an accused, the board\nwould seek evidence by obtaining the matriculation or equivalent\ncertificates and in the absence whereof the date of birth certificate\nfrom the school first attended and in absence whereof the birth\ncertificate given by a Corporation or a Municipal authority or a\nPanchayat. It is made clear by sub clause (b) that only in the absence\nof the aforesaid three documents, medical information would be\nsought from a duly constituted medical board which will declare the\nage of the juvenile or child. Thus it is only in the absence of the\naforesaid documents that the Juvenile Board could have asked for\nmedical information/ossification test.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\">28.    From the records it would appear that no sooner the respondent\nwas produced before the Juvenile Justice Board, an ossification test\nwas directed. By order dated 11.5.2012, the Juvenile Justice Board, on\nanalysing the medical report/ossification test returned the finding of\nthe respondent being a juvenile. As has been stated earlier the\naforesaid order was put to challenge though by invoking a wrong\nforum under the Act i.e. by filing a revision and not an appeal before a\nSessions Judge. The reasoning given by the Sessions Judge is\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">CRL.REV.P.362/2012                                              Page 15 of 20</span>\n absolutely incorrect. The Sessions Judge has not applied its mind to\nthe provisions of Rule 12 quoted above and decisions of the Apex\nCourt in that regard.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_40\">29.    Even with respect to analysing the ossification test the Juvenile\nBoard lost sight of the fact that the opinion per se is not conclusive\nproof of age as the ossification report is no more than an opinion. It is\na matter of common knowledge that owing to variations in climatic,\ndietic, hereditary and other factors, the structure of the body of\npersons show different results. It would be rather unsafe to formulate a\nuniform standard for the determination of age. The radiological\nexamination in the ossification test could be a useful guiding factor\nbut it does not remain incontrovertible.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_41\">30.    The Juvenile Justice Board has taken such report to be\nabsolutely infallible and has assumed it to be an accurate test to\nindicate the exact date of birth.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_42\">31.    Since it is neither feasible nor desirable to lay down any abstract\nformulae to determine the age of person, the legislature in its wisdom\nhas formulated the rules which are to be followed by the competent\nauthority in determining the age. The date of birth is required to be\ntaken on the basis of materials on record and on appreciation of\nevidence adduced by the parties. The medical evidence is the last in\nthe category of receivable material and that ought not to have been\ntreated as the only conclusive material regarding the age of the\naccused.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_43\">32.    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"27767931\" id=\"span_16\">In Court on <a href=\"/doc/27767931/\" id=\"a_33\">Its Own Motion vs. Department of Women and\nChild Development and Ors</a>, 2013(3) RCR (Criminal) 362, a Bench of\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">CRL.REV.P.362/2012                                              Page 16 of 20</span>\n this Court gave directions to the competent authorities in dealing with\nthe issue of juvenility. The Juvenile Justice Board have been directed\nto conduct proper age inquiry of each child brought before it as per the\nprocedure <a href=\"/doc/27767931/\" id=\"a_34\">laid down in</a> Rule 12 of the Delhi Juvenile Justice (Care and\nProtection of Children), Rules 2009. One of the major guidelines\ngiven in the aforesaid judgment is that the Juvenile Justice Board shall\ndetermine the age of a person by way of recording the evidence\nbrought forth by the juvenile and the prosecution/complainant and the\nparties shall be given an opportunity to examine, cross examine or re-\nexamine witnesses of their choice. In case of medical age examination,\nthe parties, are directed, to be given copies of such medical age\nexamination report by the Juvenile Justice Boards. The parties, the\nBench holds, shall have a right to file objection thereto, including the\nright to cross examine before final age determination is done.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_44\">33.    From the perusal of the order dated 11.5.2012 it becomes\nevident that the Juvenile Justice Board did not associate the\ncomplainant/petitioner in the inquiry. The doctors who constituted the\nboard were also not examined. These aspects have been completely\noverlooked by the learned Sessions Judge while upholding the order\ndated 11.5.2012. Even the medical report is found to be incomplete as\ndental X-ray is missing from such report. Dental X-ray is important as\nthe formation and number of teeth/tooth are another important and\nguiding indicia to come to a near exact conclusion about the age of a\nperson.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_45\">34.    The petitioner ought to have been associated with the inquiry. A\nperusal of the petition preferred before the Sessions Judge, challenging\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">CRL.REV.P.362/2012                                               Page 17 of 20</span>\n the age estimation of respondent no.2, reveals that the petitioner had\ncategorically stated that the respondent no.2, at the time of his\nappointment as a full time servant, informed that he was 21 years of\nage and was married. He also informed that he had studied in school\ntill class VIII in Nepal. Respondent no.2 promised to bring the school\ncertificate from his home when he would have next visited his home\ncountry. The respondent no.2 had also disclosed about his previous\nemployment at Gandhi Nagar, Delhi, which fact was promptly\ncommunicated by the petitioner to the police for the purposes of\ninvestigation for ascertaining the previous conduct of respondent no.2.\nHad the petitioner been associated with the inquiry, these facts could\nhave been put to the witnesses.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_46\">35.    May be, the materials could have been supplied by the\npetitioner for challenging the claim of juvenility of the respondent and\nit could have changed the course of investigation.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_47\">36.    Thus on the basis of the aforementioned discussion, the order\ndated 4.7.2012 passed by the Sessions Judge upholding the correctness\nof the finding of the Juvenile Justice Board and the order dated\n11.5.2012 passed by the Juvenile Justice Board cannot be\ncountenanced and approved.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_48\">37.    The aforesaid orders have to go necessarily. Both the orders are,\ntherefore, set aside.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_49\">38.    It is informed at the bar that during the period when respondent\nno.2 was in the observation home/remand home, he was made an\naccused in FIR No.241/2012 (P.S.Timarpur) dated 3.11.2012 for\noffences under <a href=\"/doc/1258372/\" id=\"a_35\">Sections 147</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_36\">149</a>/<a href=\"/doc/488479/\" id=\"a_37\">186</a>/<a href=\"/doc/1208971/\" id=\"a_38\">353</a>/<a href=\"/doc/1440821/\" id=\"a_39\">332</a> and <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_40\">34</a> of the IPC.

At the time of committing\nthe aforesaid offence, respondent no.2 had already attained majority\nand, therefore, he was sent to judicial custody at Central Jail, Tihar.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_50\">39.    In the aforesaid case also the respondent no.2 pleaded guilty and\nwas imposed a fine of Rs.2000 and was let off with a sentence of one\nyear and one month, the period which he had already undergone in\ncustody.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_51\">40.    During the hearing of this petition because of the paucity of\ncorrect information with the parties, this Court was surprised at the\nfact that despite the respondent no.2 having served the sentence\nawarded to him after his being declared a juvenile, he was stated to be\nin jail. The above clarification came only later by way of status report\nfiled by the State. It is further stated at the bar that after this Court\nexpressed its concern about the respondent no.2 being in jail, he was\nshifted to the remand home. This is also preposterous as an adult\ncannot be sent to remand home which is meant for housing juveniles\nin conflict with law. The whole purpose of setting up a juvenile home\nwould be frustrated and the juveniles housed there would get in\ncompany of an adult who is at cross roads with the law.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_52\">41.    Considering the aforementioned facts, the State is directed to\nstraightway remove respondent no.2 from the remand home and\nproduce him before the Juvenile Justice Board for redetermination of\nhis age so that the correct age could be ascertained in accordance with\nlaw.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_53\">42.
