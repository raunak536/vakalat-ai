All the cases mentioned supra were foisted\n\nonly to intimidate the petitioner and other members and they were\n\nended in acquittal, but the rowdy sheet was opened showing those\n\ncases. The petitioner was not a habitual offender and he only fought\n\nfor the rights of the Girijans. Subsequent to 2011 he was not involved\n\nin any cases.

As per the\n\nA.P. Police Manual Standing Order No.602(2), even though a\n\nsuspect/rowdy having history sheet is not figuring as an accused in the\n\nprevious 5 years after the last case in which he was involved, still the\n\nauthorities can continue his history sheet if in their considered view,\n\nhis activities are prejudicial to the maintenance of public order or one\n\neffecting peace and tranquillity in the area or the victims are not\n\ncoming forward to give complaint against him on account of threat\n\nfrom him.    It is further stated that bound over case vide Crime\n\nNo.21/2019 dated 08.02.2019 is filed for keeping good behaviour for\n\na period of one year vide M.C.No.7/2019.

Unless a close watch is being maintained against\n\nhis unlawful activities, the petitioner has every chance of repeating the\n\noffences. Although, the criminal cases registered against him were\n\nended in acquittal on various grounds, that does not confer right on\n\nthe petitioner to seek closure of rowdy sheet which was opened in\n\nview of the public interest. Hence, the petition may be dismissed.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_18\">4.    Heard the learned counsel for petitioner Sri J.

Vehemently remonstrating the opening and continuation of\n\nrowdy sheet, learned counsel for petitioner would argue that since the\n\npetitioner in the capacity of General Secretary of Aadivasi (Girijana)\n\nSamkshema and Samskruthika Sangham was submitting petitions to\n\nthe Collector and other revenue officials against the exploitative acts\n\nof non-tribals against the tribals, some politicians and vested interests\n\ngot foisted false cases against him, which were all ended in acquittal\n\nbetween 2011-2012. Therefore, the petitioner cannot be termed as\n\nhabitual offender in strict sense to empower the respondent authorities\n\nto open a rowdy sheet under the then A.P. Police Manual Standing\n\nOrder No.601. Even assuming that rowdy sheet was opened because\n\nof pendency of criminal cases at that time, the authorities should have\n\nclosed the said rowdy sheet after acquittal of accused in all the cases.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                    8</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_21\">                                                               UDPR, J\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                                     WP.No.2309 of 2020</span>\n\nHowever, without any justifiable cause, the respondent authorities\n\nhave continued the rowdy sheet even after 2012 till date. Learned\n\ncounsel strenuously argued that subsequent to 2012, the petitioner was\n\nnot involved in any criminal cases except in two bind over cases i.e.,\n\nM.C.No.6/2014 and M.C.No.7/2019. Those bind over cases are the\n\noff shoots of the criminal cases. He would submit that when the\n\ncriminal cases themselves were ended in acquittal, no much\n\nimportance can be attached to the bind over cases. He thus prayed to\n\nallow the writ petition.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_22\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_23\">6.    In oppugnation, learned Assistant Government Pleader for\n\nHome contended that the petitioner was involved in a number of\n\ncriminal cases and though they were ended in acquittal, the petitioner\n\nconstantly causing breach of peace and tranquillity in the limits of\n\nRampachodavaram Police Station. Therefore, the two bind over cases\n\nwere registered against him and pending.       Taking totality of the\n\ncircumstances and in order to maintain peace and harmony in the\n\ntribal villages, the rowdy sheet was opened in the year 2011 and same\n\nis being continued which is perfectly legal.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_24\">7.    The point for consideration is whether the opening of rowdy\n\nsheet against the petitioner and its continuation are justifiable?\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_25\">8.

Coming to the case on hand, admittedly rowdy sheet No.1/2011\n\nwas opened against petitioner on 20.08.2011.                  By then he was\n\ninvolved in (i) Cr.No.20/2011 (C.C.No.62/2011) (ii) Cr.No.41/2011\n\n(PRC No.5/2011) (iii) Cr.No.53/2011 (C.C.No.220/2011) (iv)\n\nCr.No.54/2011         (C.C.No.221/2011)        and     (v)        Cr.No.100/2011\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">                                   17</span>\n                                                                UDPR, J\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">                                                      WP.No.2309 of 2020</span>\n\n(C.C.No.229/2011). It must be noted that during the year 2011-12 all\n\nthe aforesaid cases were ended in acquittal. As per the Standing\n\nOrder No.601(A) which was in vogue by 2011, it was not suffice that\n\na person was involved in some criminal cases to open a rowdy sheet,\n\nbut he must habitually commit, attempt to commit or abet the\n\ncommission of offences involving breach of peace, disturbance to\n\npublic order and security (emphasis supplied). The respondents have\n\nnot produced the material which weighed with the authorities to hold\n\nthat the five cases in which the petitioner was involved by then had\n\nthe tendency of causing breach of peace, disturbance to public order\n\nand security. Therefore, there is any amount of doubt as to whether\n\nthe initial opening of rowdy sheet was bolstered by cogent material\n\nand reasoned order.     Going by the ratio in some of the above\n\njudgments, it is clear that rowdy sheets cannot be opened in a\n\nmechanical, routine and cavalier manner without applying caution and\n\ncircumspection followed by reasons.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_64\">      (a) Be that it may, continuation of rowdy sheet is concerned,\n\neven though all the criminal cases were ended in acquittal even by\n\nFebruary 2012 and petitioner was not involved in any other criminal\n\ncases except the bind over case i.e., M.C.No.6/2014 (Cr.No.23/2014),\n\nstill the rowdy sheet has been continued. The respondents have not\n\nproduced any material before this Court to show what has prompted\n\nthe authorities to continue the rowdy sheet between 2012 and 2014.\n\nSo far as continuation of rowdy sheet from 2014 till date is concerned,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">                                        18</span>\n                                                                         UDPR, J\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">                                                               WP.No.2309 of 2020</span>\n\nthe petitioner produced the copies of extension orders for the years\n\n2016-17, 2017-18 &amp; 2018-19 issued by the Assistant Superintendent\n\nof Police, Rampachodavaram.             These orders which are identical\n\nwould show that on the request for extension made by the Sub-\n\nInspector of Police, Rampachodavaram P.S., the recommendation was\n\nmade by the Inspector of Police and extension order was passed by the\n\nAssistant Superintendent of Police.

As\n\nper the Standing Order No.602(2), the history sheet of a\n\nsuspect/rowdy can be continued if SP/DCP/CP is of the considered\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">                                   19</span>\n                                                                UDPR, J\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_50\">                                                      WP.No.2309 of 2020</span>\n\nview that his activities are prejudicial to the maintenance of public\n\norder or one affecting peace and tranquillity in the area or the victims\n\nare not coming forward to give complaint against him on account of\n\nthreat from him. Unfortunately in the above orders of the Assistant\n\nSuperintendent of Police, none of the grounds was even insinuatingly\n\nmentioned justifying the extension of rowdy sheet from year to year.\n\nThe permission was granted by a short shrift.             <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"232602\" id=\"span_51\">In <a href=\"/doc/232602/\" id=\"a_41\">Sunkara\n\nSatyanarayana</a> (1 supra) also, when the SDPO, Gudivada wrote a\n\nsimilar order stating that &quot;Sheet may be retained upto 31.12.1999&quot;,\n\nthe High Court condemned the same and observed that the concerned\n\nOfficer has not at all applied mind while passing the order. The\n\npresent case is one such instance. Running the risk of repetition, it is\n\nmade clear that the orders of public servants which have the far\n\nreaching effect on the life, liberty, property and welfare of the public\n\nmust be based on cogent reasons. The proverb &quot;brevity is the soul of\n\nwit&quot; may suit to poets but not to responsible public servants. As can\n\nbe seen from the representation dated 12.05.2014 of the petitioner to\n\nthe District Collector &amp; Assistant Superintendent of Police, his\n\ngrievance is that by dint of rowdy sheet, he was frequently called to\n\nthe police station and detained which causes fear and embarrassment\n\nto him and his family members.           Since such acts amount to\n\nobstructive surveillance and as there are no cogent reasons for\n\ncontinuation of rowdy sheet, I deem it a fit case to allow the\n\nwrit petition.</span>\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\">                                   20</span><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_68\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_69\">                                                               UDPR, J\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_53\">                                                     WP.No.2309 of 2020</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_70\">16.
