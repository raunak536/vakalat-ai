Before proceedings to address to the issues involved in the petition, it\n\n   would be appropriate to refer to the relevant provisions of the Police\n\n   Rules of 1960 being germane herein.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_15\">       Rule 698 of the Rules of 1960 deals with Surveillance Register No.\n\n   10 and provides that in every police station a Surveillance Register shall\n\n   be maintained, wherein in Part I of such Register names of the classes of\n\n   persons residing within the local jurisdiction of a police station have to be\n\n   entered being all persons who have been proclaimed under section 87 Cr\n\n   PC, all released convicts in regard to whom an order under section 565 Cr\n\n   PC has been made, all convicts the execution of whose sentence is\n\n   suspended in whole or any part of whose punishment has been remitted\n\n   conditionally under <a href=\"/doc/1571667/\" id=\"a_7\">section 401</a> Cr.P.C and all persons restricted under\n\n   Rules of Government made under section 16 of Habitual Offenders\n\n   (Control and Reforms) Act, 1956, whereas in Part II of such Register\n\n   with the discretion of the Superintendent the names of following class of\n\n   persons can be entered being those persons who have been convicted\n\n   thrice or more than three times of offences mentioned in Rule 681, and\n\n   those persons who are reasonably believed to be habitual offenders or\n\n   receivers of stolen property whether they have been convicted or not,\n\n   those persons under security under sections 109 and 110 Cr PC.\n\n       Rule 699 of the Rules of 1960 deals with entries in and cancellation\n\n   from Surveillance Register and provides that the Surveillance Register\n\n   shall be written up by an Officer Incharge of the Police Station personally\n\n   or by an Assistant Sub Inspector and no entry shall be made in Part I\n\n   except by the order of a Gazatted Officer and that ordinarily before the\n\n   name of a person is entered in Part II of the Register, a History Sheet\n\n   shall be opened for such person, providing further that when the\n    Superintendent of Police on his own accord or on the report of the\n\n   Subordinate Officer deems proper to enter the name of a person in\n\n   Register No. 10, he has to hear the objections of that person and after\n\n   fully satisfying himself, order the entry of the person in Register No. 10.\n\n      Rule 702 of the Rules of 1960 deals with preparation of History Sheet\n\n   and provides that the initial preparation of History Sheet requires great\n\n   care and invariably be done by the Officer Incharge of the Police Station\n\n   himself or by a thoroughly experienced Assistant Sub Inspector under\n\n   specific orders and the description of the criminal should be such as will\n\n   enable the person reading it to form for himself a picture of the individual\n\n   and the space for relations and connections has to be filled in with a view\n\n   to afford clues to those persons with whom the criminal is likely to\n\n   harbour when wanted by the police, including relations or friends living\n\n   at a distance from his home, and his associates in crime abettors and\n\n   receivers, and that the particulars of the property, mode or earning\n\n   livelihood has also to be entered for facilitating a judgment as to whether\n\n   a criminal is at any time living beyond his means and whether he is an\n\n   owner of property, a tenant or a wage earner and that a description of the\n\n   crime to which the criminal is addicted to has also to be entered in some\n\n   detail, showing not merely the class of crime, but the particular type of\n\n   that crime, methods followed, localities frequented, weapons or\n\n   instruments used and the copies of the History Sheet so prepared had to\n\n   be published in Criminal Investigation Department and published in\n\n   Central Intelligence Gazette.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"124114412\" id=\"span_1\">11. A perusal of the aforesaid rules ex facie suggest that the entries in the\n\n   Surveillance Register have to be prepared and drawn both objectively\n\n   meaning making an unbiased balanced observation based on facts which\n can be verified and subjectively as well meaning making assumptions,\n\ninterpretations based on personal opinions without any verifiable facts.\n\n   A reference hereunder to the judgment of the Apex Court passed in\n\nthe case titled as &quot;<a href=\"/doc/124114412/\" id=\"a_8\">Malak Singh &amp; Ors. Vs. State of P&amp;H &amp; Ors.</a>\n\nreported in 1981 SCC 420&quot; would be relevant herein, wherein at paras 6\n\n&amp; 9 following has been provided:-</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">   &quot;6. Prevention of crime is one of the prime purposes of the Constitution\n   of a police force. The preamble to the <a href=\"/doc/6156119/\" id=\"a_9\">Police Act</a> 1861 says : Whereas it\n   is expedient to reorganise the police and to make it a more efficient\n   instrument for the prevention and detection of crime. <a href=\"/doc/178428968/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 23</a> of the\n   Police Act prescribes it as the duty of police officers &quot;to collect and\n   communicate intelligence affecting the public peace, to prevent the\n   commission of offences and public nuisances&quot;. In connection with these\n   duties it will be necessary to keep discreet surveillance over reputed bad\n   characters, habitual offenders and other potential offenders. Organised\n   crime cannot be successfully fought without close watch of suspects.\n   But, surveillance may be intrusive and it may so seriously encroach on\n   the privacy of a citizen as to infringe his fundamental right to personal\n   liberty guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_11\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution and the freedom of\n   movement guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1024002/\" id=\"a_12\">Article 19(1)(d).</a> That cannot be permitted.\n   This is recognised by the Punjab Police Rules themselves. Rule 23.7,\n   which prescribes the mode of surveillance, permits that the close watch\n   over the movements of the person under surveillance but without any\n   illegal interference. Permissible surveillance is only to the extent of a\n   close watch over the movements of the person under surveillance and no\n   more. So long as surveillance is for the purpose of preventing crime and\n   is confined to the limits prescribed by Rule 23.7 we do not think a\n   person whose name is included in the surveillance register can have a\n   genuine cause for complaint. We may notice here that interference in\n   accordance with law and for the prevention of disorder and crime is an\n   exception recognised even by European Convention of Human Rights to\n   the right to respect for a person&#x27;s private and family life. <a href=\"/doc/691208/\" id=\"a_13\">Article 8</a> of the\n   Convention reads as follows:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">   (1) Everyone&#x27;s right to respect for his private and family life, his home\n   and his correspondence shall be recognized.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">    (2) There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise\n   of this right, except such as is in accordance with law and is necessary\n   in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public\n   safety, for the prevention of disorder and crime or for the protection of\n   health or morals.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_18\">   9. But all this does not mean that the police have a licence to enter the\n   names of whoever they like (dislike?) in the surveillance register; nor can\n   the surveillance be such as to squeeze the fundamental freedoms\n   guaranteed to all citizens or to obstruct the free exercise and enjoyment of\n   those freedoms; nor can the surveillance so intrude as to offend the dignity\n   of the individual. Surveillance of persons who do not fall within the\n   categories mentioned in Rule 23.4 or for reasons unconnected with the\n   prevention of crime, or excessive surveillance falling beyond the limits\n   prescribed by the rules, will entitle a citizen to the Court&#x27;s protection which\n   the court will not hesitate to give. The very rules which prescribe the\n   conditions for making entries in the surveillance register and the mode of\n   surveillance appear to recognise the caution and care with which the police\n   officers are required to proceed. The note following Rule 23.4 is\n   instructive. It enjoins a duty upon the police officer to construe the rule\n   strictly and confine the entries in the surveillance register to the class of\n   persons mentioned in the rule. Similarly Rule 23.7 demands that there\n   should be no illegal interference in the guise of surveillance. Surveillance,\n   therefore, has to be unobstrusive and within bounds.&quot;\n\n\n   Thus what emanates from the above is that though organized crime\n\ncannot be successfully fought without close watch of suspects, yet\n\nsurveillance may be intrusive and may seriously encroach on the privacy\n\nof a citizen, infringe his/her fundamental right to personal liberty\n\nguaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_14\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution and the freedom of\n\nmovement guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_15\">Article 19(I) (d)</a> of the Constitution,\n\ntherefore, enjoining a duty upon the police officer to construe the rule\n\nstrictly and confine the entries in the Surveillance Register un-obstrusive\n\nand within bounds without squeezing the fundamental freedoms\n\nguaranteed to a citizens or to obstruct the free exercise and enjoyment of\n    those freedoms also keeping in mind that the surveillance should not be\n\n   so intrude as to offend the dignity of an individual and that the very rules\n\n   which prescribe the conditions for making entries in the Surveillance\n\n   Register and the mode of surveillance must recognize the caution and\n\n   care with which the police officers are required to proceed.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_19\">12. Reverting back to the case in hand, it is not in dispute that the case of\n\n   the petitioner does not fall within Part I of Rule 698 supra.\n\n       Perusal of the record would reveal that the name of the petitioner has\n\n   been entered into Surveillance Register purportedly falling in Part II of\n\n   Rule 698 supra on account of his being involved in FIR No. 247/2009\n\n   registered at P/S Gandhi Nagar for commission of offences under\n\n   sections 302, 201, <a href=\"/doc/968081/\" id=\"a_16\">34</a>, 409, 120-B RPC, 3/25/27 <a href=\"/doc/1934415/\" id=\"a_17\">Arms Act</a>, having been\n\n   entered on 05.02.2009 by Inspector Mohammad Rafiq, SHO P/S Gandhi\n\n   Nagar. It is pertinent to mention here while risking repetition that the\n\n   petitioner stands acquitted in the said case by a competent court on\n\n   10.08.2020.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_20\">13. Perusal of the record would also reveal that the entry of the petitioner is\n\n   being continued to be in the Surveillance Register by the respondents\n\n   ever since his name was entered therein on 05.02.2009 though the said\n\n   fact of the acquittal of the petitioner has also been entered in the Register\n\n   in question by the respondent on 23.01.2021 yet his name has been\n\n   continuously entered in the said Register, thereafter and lastly on\n\n   06.04.2023 by SHO Police Station Gandhi Nagar, Jammu, though it has\n\n   been provided therein that the petitioner is involved in FIR No. 275/2009\n\n   for offences<a href=\"/doc/1420677/\" id=\"a_18\"> u/s 5(2)</a> PC Act pending before Anti Corruption Court,\n\n   Jammu and that the entry of the petitioner has been ordered to be\n\n   continued in the Register under the instructions of the SP Jammu,\n   although the said case stands rejected by the said Court and is presently\n\n  under further investigation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_21\">14. Having regard to the aforesaid facts and circumstances as also the\n\n  principles of law laid down by the Apex Court in the judgment supra, the\n\n  continuation of the entry of the name of the petitioner in the Surveillance\n\n  Register seemingly is being continued by the respondents without\n\n  drawing any subjective satisfaction in this regard mechanically being a\n\n  person reasonably believed to be habitual offender. No reasons muchless\n\n  cogent and credible have been recorded in the Surveillance Register for\n\n  continuing the name of the petitioner therein on a mere belief without\n\n  drawing any subjective satisfaction of possessing a reasonable belief that\n\n  the petitioner is a habitual offender or is a person habitually addicted to\n\n  crime thus necessitating to continuation of entering of his name in the\n\n  Surveillance Register.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_22\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_23\">        Here a reference to the judgment of the Apex Court in regard to a\n\n  &quot;habitual offender&quot; passed in case titled as &quot;Dhanji Ram Sharma V.s\n\n  Superintendent of Police, North reported in AIR 1966 SC 1766&quot; would\n\n  be relevant herein wherein at para 7 following has been laid down.\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">     &quot;A habitual offender or a person habitually addicted to crime is one who is\n     a criminal by habit or by disposition formed by repetition of crimes.\n     Reasonable belief of the police officer that the suspect is a habitual\n     offender or is a person habitually addicted to crime is sufficient to justify\n     action under Rules 23.4 (3) (b) and 23.9 (2). Mere belief is not sufficient.\n     The belief must be reasonable, it must be based on reasonable grounds. The\n     suspect may or may not have been convicted of any crime. Even apart from\n     any conviction, there may be reasonable grounds for believing that he is a\n     habitual offender.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_24\">       15.
