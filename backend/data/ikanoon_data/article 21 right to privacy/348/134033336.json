The common facts in both cases are that on 28.03.2011 both the\n\npetitioners who were employed by the Central Industrial Security Force\n\n(CISF) met in a hotel room at Kelson Dx, Paharganj from where petitioner\n\nConstable Premlata Kumari made a telephone call making certain\n\nallegations against Ajit Singh (Petitioner in W.P.(C) No.4872/2012).\n\nThereafter a committee of (i) Shri M.K.T.

The said petitioner Ajit Singh submitted his representation dated\n\n23.08.2011 against the findings of Enquiry Officer.          The disciplinary\n\nauthority went through the reply of the petitioner and thereafter made the\n\nfollowing observations:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">            &quot;8. .....The statement of charged force member that on\n            28.03.2011 in hotel Kelson DX room No.101 he did not\n            make physical relation with women constable Premlata\n            Kumari is not acceptable, the charged force member himself\n            showed his voter ID card and introduced women constable\n            Premlata Kumari as his wife and booked a room in hotel\n            and stayed with women constable Premlata Kumari in room\n            for three hours alone. Apart from this the charged force\n            member has himself accepted that previously also for 2-3\n            times he has meet women constable Premlata Kumari alone\n            and has also spent time with her in hotel after booking a\n            room. If the charged force member had to only talk with\n            women constable Premlata Kumari he could have done so\n\n\n\n\nW.P.(C) Nos.3977/2012 and 4872/2012                                         Page 3\n             by going at any public place. But stating the women\n            constable Premlata Kumari to be his wife, booking a room\n            and staying with the women constable Premlata Kumari for\n            alone, itself raises a question mark on the conduct of the\n            charged force member.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">            9.

The penalty of removal from service was imposed against the\n\npetitioner. He preferred an appeal. The Appellate Authority after going\n\nthrough the appeal of the petitioner rejected it. The revision which was\n\npreferred by Ajit Singh was also rejected. The revisional authority observed\n\nthat:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">            &quot;Minute analysis of materials held on record in the case file\n            reveals that the petitioner was involved in physical relation\n            with his subordinate Lady Constable of the Force immorally\n            at Hotel Kelson Dx, Paharganj, New Delhi on 28.03.2011\n            for which he booked Room No. 101 in the hotel by paying\n            Rs. 1000/- for a day room rent, falsely declaring Lady\n            Constable Premlata Kumari as his wife.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_9\">8.      It is apparent that all the authorities starting from the enquiry officer\n\ntill the revisional authority have concurred on the finding that the petitioner\n\n\n\n\nW.P.(C) Nos.3977/2012 and 4872/2012                                         Page 4\n developed a physical relationship with Ct. Premlata with mutual consent.\n\nAlthough in his representation the petitioner had levelled allegations against\n\nCt.Premlata Kumari, those were rejected as baseless by the enquiry officer,\n\nappellate authority as well as the revisional authority.\n\nEnquiry in case W.P.(C) 3977/2012 of Prem Lata woman Constable.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_10\">9.

The petitioner duly replied the memorandum. After conclusion of the\n\nenquiry, the enquiry officer submitted a report on 23.10.2011, whereby on\n\nthe basis of evidence recorded during the enquiry, it was concluded that;\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">             &quot; Decision of the Facts:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">            Contention of the charge official that on 28.03.2011 SI/Exe\n            Ajit Singh had made physical relations forcibly with her in\n            Room No. 101 of Hotel Kelson Dx is not acceptable,\n            because the prosecution witnesses no. 1,2,3 and 4 who had\n            gone to the place of incident Room No. 101 of Hotel Kelson\n\n\n\n\nW.P.(C) Nos.3977/2012 and 4872/2012                                           Page 5\n             on 29.01.2011 and keeping in view the position of the place\n            of incident they have clarified that on looking the position of\n            the place of incident and the expressions of both the force\n            members, nothing such is apparent that any act has been\n            committed with the charged official forcibly. It became\n            clear from the statement of prosecution witness No. 1,2,3\n            and 4 and the question answer put to them that on\n            28.03.2011, the incident of making physical relation in\n            Room No. 101 of Hotel Kelson Dx, the same has happened\n            with the mutual consent of lady constable Prem Lata\n            Kumari and SI/Exe Ajit Singh.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\">11.    In the said order, the respondents noted the following facts being\n\nproved on record:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">             &quot;It has been clearly stated keeping in view the\n            circumstances, nothing such was apparent that any forcible\n            act has been committed with lady Constable Prem Lata,\n            rather the incident which took place for developing physical\n            relation, the same has happened with the mutual consent of\n            both of them.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_13\">12.    The enquiry report also contains the summary of the statement\n\nof the charged official Premlata Kumari and has noted as follows:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">            &quot;In reply to question 11 she stated of not finding the parents\n            of Ajit Singh there, she had gone with SI Ajit Singh in the\n            room because SI Ajit Singh had given her proposal of\n            marriage.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_14\">13.    Then again during the enquiry proceedings the petitioner had stated:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">            &quot;In reply to question 14 she told that SI Ajit Singh was not\n            unknown person, he was the senior officer of her\n            department, apart from this they had already love affairs\n            with each other. In reply to question 15 she stated, &quot;yes, we\n\n\n\n\nW.P.(C) Nos.3977/2012 and 4872/2012                                           Page 6\n             had already developed physical relation.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\">14.    Again in reply to question 24, Premlata Kumari had stated:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">            &quot;that SI Ajit Singh had promised to marry, therefore I had\n            not made complaint to the police,&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_16\">15.    On the basis of this enquiry report, the final order was passed whereby\n\nthe Commanding Officer, on the strength of the evidence recorded during\n\nthe enquiry and statement of petitioner, concluded that the physical\n\nrelationship between the petitioners SI Ajit Singh and Ct. Premlata Kumari\n\nwas with mutual consent and that no force had been used against the latter.\n\nThe Commanding Officer concluded thus:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">            &quot;It become clear from the statements of prosecution\n            witnesses No. 1,2,3 and 4 and from the question answers\n            asked from them that the incident of making physical\n            relation in Room No. 101 of Hotel Kelson Dx on\n            28.03.2011, the same has happened with the mutual consent\n            of the charged official and SI/Exe Ajit Singh. From the\n            statement of the charge official and from the question\n            answer asked from her, it is proved that under a pre-\n            planned plan the charged official left the Shashtri park\n            Ladies Hotel in uniform and along with civil dress with the\n            members of the first shift without any intimation and without\n            permission of the Competent Officer on 28.03.2011. After\n            changing the clothes at Rajiv Chowk Metro Station met with\n            SI/Exe Ajit Singh at gate No. 2 of R.K. Ashram Road Metro\n            Station and along with him both went to Hotel Kelson Dx\n            and booked room No. 101 both as husband and wife and\n            remained in that room for about 3 hours and developed\n            physical relation. In reply to question No. 15 during the\n            question answer in the inquiry the charged official herself\n\n\n\n\nW.P.(C) Nos.3977/2012 and 4872/2012                                         Page 7\n              admitted that she had gone to some hotel of Pahar Ganj\n             alongwith SI/Ex Ajit Singh prior to 28.03.2011 and they had\n             made physical relation. From this it is proved that charged\n             official and SI/Exe Ajit Singh have been making physical\n             relation by going in hotel also prior to 28.03.2011. To state\n             this by the charged official in reply to question 14, they had\n             already love affair, it is also proved that due to the love\n             affairs, the charged official under the pre-planned plan had\n             gone to the hotel on her own on 28.03.2011 and had made\n             physical relation with him.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_17\">16.       Thereafter, the Commanding Officer imposed a punishment of\n\nremoval from service against the petitioner who then preferred an\n\nappeal. His appeal was dismissed by the appellate authority by order\n\ndated 29.11.2011.          After considering all the contentions in the\n\npetitioner&#x27;s appeal, the Appellate Authority recorded the following\n\nfacts:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">             &quot;During the inquiry this fact came in light that the\n             above said force member has left in uniform in the bus\n             of the First Shift, which takes the Lady force members\n             from the Barrack to station for morning duty, while her\n             duty was not in the first shift. She met with No.\n             092810095 SI/Exe Ajit Singh near R.K. Ashram Metro\n             Station and both have gone to Hotel Kelson Dx Pahar\n             Ganj, New Delhi. Where they with mutual consent has\n             made physical relations.....&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_18\">17.       From the enquiry report, dismissal order, appellate authority&#x27;s\n\nand revisional authority&#x27;s order in both cases it is apparent that the\n\nauthorities had maintained throughout on the basis of the evidence on\n\n\n\n\nW.P.(C) Nos.3977/2012 and 4872/2012                                           Page 8\n record that both the petitioners had established a physical relationship\n\nwith mutual consent. These authorities had rejected all contentions\n\nraised by the petitioners against each other as unfounded. There is no\n\ndispute that during the enquiry the prescribed procedure was followed\n\nand the petitioners were afforded due opportunity and had also been\n\nheard. The petitioners too have not found any fault in the manner the\n\nenquiry was conducted.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_19\">18.      The common argument of learned counsel for both petitioners is\n\nthat given the proved facts during enquiry, they had not committed\n\nany misconduct as they had not violated any rules or regulations of the\n\nforce.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"46816576\" id=\"span_1\">19.      Misconduct is not defined under the CISF Rules. However, in <a href=\"/doc/46816576/\" id=\"a_1\">Shri\n\nSantosh Kumar Sur vs. Union of India and Ors</a>: (2010) ILR 4 Delhi 788,\n\nthis Court has defined the misconduct as under:-</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">            &quot;48. The petitioner has, therefore, raised a basic question\n            as to what is the nature of conduct which could be\n            construed as misconduct inviting disciplinary proceedings\n            and penalty against him. The expression `Misconduct&#x27; is not\n            defined under the <a href=\"/doc/242448/\" id=\"a_2\">CISF Act, 1969</a>. It is well established that\n            in case a term has not been statutorily defined, guidance\n            from the meaning obtainable in ordinary and common\n            parlance may be taken and the word has to be understood in\n            its ordinary dictionary meaning. Since it is difficult to give\n\n\n\n\nW.P.(C) Nos.3977/2012 and 4872/2012                                          Page 9\n             an exhaustive definition of what amounts to misconduct, the\n            ordinary meaning of the expression &quot;misconduct&quot; in various\n            dictionaries may be considered.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">       A reading of that judgment would reveal that the Court noticed\n\nseveral judgments. The judgment of the Supreme Court in State of Punjab v.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">Ram Singh 1992 (4) SCC 541 inter alia states that\n\n                  &quot;6. Thus it could be seen that the word &#x27;misconduct&#x27;\n                  though not capable of precise definition, its\n                  reflection receives its connotation from the context,\n                  the delinquency in its performance and its effect on\n                  the discipline and the nature of the duty. It may\n                  involve moral turpitude, it must be improper or\n                  wrong behaviour; unlawful behaviour, wilful in\n                  character; forbidden act, a transgression of\n                  established and definite rule of action or code of\n                  conduct but not mere error of judgment,\n                  carelessness or negligence in performance of the\n                  duty; the act complained of bears forbidden quality\n                  or character. Its ambit has to be construed with\n                  reference to the subject-matter and the context\n                  wherein the term occurs, regard being had to the\n                  scope of the statute and the public purpose it seeks\n                  to serve. The police service is a disciplined service\n                  and it requires to maintain strict discipline. Laxity in\n                  this behalf erodes discipline in the service causing\n                  serious effect in the maintenance of law and order.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">       The authorities are unanimous in that though the term &quot;misconduct&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_22\">has many hues, it touches upon the behaviour and acts of some in relation to\n\nhis office. At the same time, if the behaviour is reprehensible, and results in\n\n\n\n\nW.P.(C) Nos.3977/2012 and 4872/2012                                          Page 10\n lowering esteem of the general public of the office, the conduct may be\n\nmisconduct regardless of its being unconnected with official work.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_23\">20.    Further the provisions of Rule 3 of CCS (Conduct) Rules, 1969\n\nprovides the functions and duties of every Government servant:\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">            &quot;69. So far as the duties which the petitioner was required\n            to perform are concerned, our attention is drawn to the\n            provisions of Rule 3 of the Central Civil Service (Conduct)\n            Rules, 1964 which provides the following functions and\n            duties of every Government Servant:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">            3. General\n            (1) Every Government servant shall at all times--\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_24\">            (i) maintain absolute integrity;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_25\">            (ii) maintain devotion to duty; and\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_26\">            (iii) do nothing which is unbecoming of a Government\n            servant.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_27\">21.    The legal position is, therefore, crystal clear that even if an act of a\n\nGovernment servant does not fall within the ambit of misconduct, the\n\nemployer is not precluded, in certain circumstances and peculiar facts, from\n\nreasonably treating such an act as misconduct. From the findings of the\n\nenquiry report it is apparent that both the petitioners had established their\n\nrelationship voluntarily. The evidence on the enquiry record shows that the\n\npetitioners were in love and planned to marry. Constable Premlata had even\n\nasked her parents to consider SI Ajit Singh as her future husband and made\n\n\n\n\nW.P.(C) Nos.3977/2012 and 4872/2012                                       Page 11\n enquiries about him. She also admitted that her parents did in fact, make\n\nenquiries about SI Ajit Singh. SI Ajit also in his statement had\n\nacknowledged his relationship with Premlata and their plans of marrying.\n\nThese statements clearly show that they seriously contemplated marriage\n\nand life together. In the context of these facts, it was the duty of the\n\nrespondent to show that this constituted an act forbidden, improper or\n\nprohibited or an act unbecoming of a government employee.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_28\">22.    The contention of the respondent is that by their acts, the delinquents\n\nhad brought disrepute to the Force in the eye of hotel staff/general public\n\nand thus violated the discipline of the Force. However, the charges given to\n\ndo not speak of bringing disrepute in the eye of hotel staff/general public,\n\nbut that the petitioners went to the hotel and established a physical\n\nrelationship, which maligned the image of Force and amounted to a breach\n\nof discipline of the Force.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_29\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"687159\" id=\"span_2\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1681994\" id=\"span_3\">23.    No evidence has been brought on record by the respondent to prove\n\nthat any disrepute had been brought to the Force or that the image of the\n\nForce stood maligned by the act of the petitioners. There are no allegations\n\nthat they had indulged in any physical act in public or in public view or\n\nwithin view of hotel staff. At the relevant time, the petitioners were\n\n\n\n\nW.P.(C) Nos.3977/2012 and 4872/2012                                     Page 12\n consenting adults, and were together in a hotel in the privacy of a room\n\noccupied by them. No one can or should (the public employer being no\n\nexception) be allowed to speculate what transpired between them. Equally\n\nthe State or a public employer cannot intrude into the privacy of an\n\nindividual&#x27;s personal relationship. It is established law that no individual\n\ndilutes or surrenders his fundamental rights upon entering public service.\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1681994/\" id=\"a_3\">O.K. Ghosh v. E.X.

Clearly the autonomy and choice of the petitioners was\n\ntargetted baselessly by the CISF, when the choice was neither unlawful nor\n\nwas done in public, or within public view. Society is slowly liberating itself\n\nand in the process of such liberation, what was once considered a taboo or a\n\nprohibited act earlier, has found acceptance in society.</span></span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_30\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1364215\" id=\"span_4\">24.

The expression &#x27;privacy&#x27;\n\nnecessarily includes the freedom to private intimacy and autonomy which\n\ngives an individual opportunity to establish and nurture relationships\n\nconsensually and without harming any other individual.

As per respondent&#x27;s own case, the petitioners, unmarried, were in a\n\nconsensual relationship. The acts of misconduct attributed to them occurred\n\nin privacy. It is nobody&#x27;s case that these were in dereliction of their duties or\n\noffended any law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_34\">27.    The respondents have failed to bring to our notice any rule or\n\nregulation governing the petitioner, which forbids consensual relationship\n\nbetween adult, public servants. Absence of any rule/law which prohibits\n\nsomeone&#x27;s consensual physical relationship with another, (except what is an\n\noffence), it, therefore cannot be a misconduct. Constable Premlata was also\n\ncharged for leaving the hostel along with girls of &#x27;A&#x27; shift on the pretext of\n\nduty and went along with SI Ajit Singh, but in the circumstance of the case,\n\nthis can be termed only a small lie spoken with the sole object of meeting\n\nthe beloved.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_35\">28.    In view of the totality of circumstances of the case, we are of the\n\nopinion that the act of the petitioners does not constitute misconduct for the\n\nreason that the respondents have miserably failed to produce any evidence\n\non record to show that the petitioners had lowered the reputation of the force\n\nor committed breach of discipline.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_36\">29.
