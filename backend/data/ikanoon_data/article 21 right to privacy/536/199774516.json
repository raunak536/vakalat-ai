The first child born from the\n\n wedlock with K. Raja Armugam was prior to her being appointed with\n\n Respondent No.2.

Since <a href=\"/doc/111604/\" id=\"a_6\">Article 42</a> specifically speaks of &quot;just and\n\n humane conditions of work&quot; and &quot;maternity relief&quot;, the validity of an\n\n executive or administrative action in denying maternity benefit has to\n\n be examined on the anvil of <a href=\"/doc/111604/\" id=\"a_7\">Article 42</a> which, though not enforceable as\n\n law, is nevertheless available for determining the legal efficacy of the\n\n action complained of. Under <a href=\"/doc/1603957/\" id=\"a_8\">Article 15(3)</a> of the Constitution, the State\n\n is empowered to enact beneficial provisions for advancing the interests\n\n of women. The right to reproduction and child rearing has been\n\n recognized as an important facet of a person&#x27;s right to privacy, dignity\n\n and bodily integrity under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_9\">Article 21.</a> <a href=\"/doc/111604/\" id=\"a_10\">Article 42</a> enjoins the State to\n\n make provisions for securing just and humane conditions of work and\n\n for maternity relief. The objective of maternity leave is expounded by\n\n the Supreme Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/450185/\" id=\"a_11\">B. Shah Vs. Presiding Officer, Labour</a>\n\n Court, Coimbatore3. The Supreme Court observed that maternity leave\n\n legislation is intended to achieve the object of doing social justice to\n\n women workers. The said piece of regulation/rule would enable the\n\n women workers not only to subsist, but also to make up for her\n\n dissipated energy, nurse her child, preserve her efficiency as a worker\n\n and maintain the level of her previous efficiency and output.</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_21\"> 13.          Maternity Leave Regulation, 2003 of Respondent No.2\n\n provides that a female employee with less than two surviving children\n\n\n 3 AIR 1978, SC 12\n\n\n\n\n                                   6 of 14\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">::: Uploaded on - 10/05/2024                  ::: Downloaded on - 30/05/2024 11:31:44 :::</span>\n  Tauseef                                                         17-WP.8744.2015-J.doc\n\n\n may be granted maternity leave of 135 days/180 days twice during her\n\n service period.         It further provides that to avail the said leave, the\n\n employee should have completed at least one-year regular service in\n\n AAI. The objective of the said Regulation is to enable the employee to\n\n nurse her child and to make up for her dissipated energy and preserve\n\n her energy as a worker to regain the level of her efficiency as it was\n\n prior to her pregnancy. The leave is granted for a period of 135/180\n\n days. The phrase &quot;twice in service period&quot; read with the phrase &quot;less\n\n than two surviving children&quot; and further read with &quot;one-year regular\n\n service&quot; would mean that a female employee in the normal\n\n circumstances would get the benefit of maternity leave only two times\n\n in service period and, therefore, the condition of &quot;two surviving\n\n children&quot; is subjected. In our view, since the objective is to give the\n\n maternity leave benefit only two times during the service period, the\n\n condition of &quot;two surviving children&quot; if read in that context would mean\n\n that the female employee should have given birth to the two surviving\n\n children only during the service period. The objective of this Regulation\n\n is to give maternity leave benefit and not to curb the population. The\n\n condition of two surviving children is subjected so that the maximum\n\n times a female employee can benefit is only twice. This is to ensure that\n\n the organization is not without the services of the employee for more\n\n than two times. It is, therefore, to maintain the balance between the\n\n\n\n\n                                        7 of 14\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">::: Uploaded on - 10/05/2024                      ::: Downloaded on - 30/05/2024 11:31:44 :::</span>\n  Tauseef                                                       17-WP.8744.2015-J.doc\n\n\n absence of the employee and the benefit of maternity leave that there is\n\n a cap of availing the said benefit only twice during the service period.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_22\"> 14.          In the instant case before us, the first child from the first\n\n marriage of the Petitioner was born before the Petitioner joined\n\n Respondent No.2. After the Petitioner joined the Respondent No.2, she\n\n remarried and gave birth to two children, one on 27 th June 2009 and\n\n second on 3rd September 2012.            She did not take the benefit of\n\n maternity leave at the time of giving birth on 27 th June 2009. She\n\n applied for the said benefit for the first time by applications dated 3 rd\n\n September 2012 and 19th December 2013, pursuant to her giving birth\n\n to second child after joining Respondent No.2. Therefore, in our view,\n\n since the Petitioner has given birth to two children during the service\n\n period and having not taken the benefit of maternity leave at the time\n\n of giving birth to the first child after joining Respondent No.2, she\n\n would be entitled to the maternity leave benefit when she applied on 3 rd\n\n September 2012, at the time of giving birth to her second child since\n\n said leave was sought to be availed only once after joining service.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_23\"> 15.          It is also important to note that the benefit of maternity leave\n\n and the condition imposed therein has been drafted keeping in mind\n\n the normal circumstances, where a female employee marries only once\n\n and gives birth thereafter.      In a situation before us, the Petitioner\n\n\n\n\n                                      8 of 14\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">::: Uploaded on - 10/05/2024                    ::: Downloaded on - 30/05/2024 11:31:44 :::</span>\n  Tauseef                                                     17-WP.8744.2015-J.doc\n\n\n remarried after joining Respondent No.2 because her husband had\n\n passed away and from the said wedlock, she had a child. At that point\n\n of time, she was not in the employment of Respondent No.2. In our\n\n view, the fact situation before us would be an exceptional circumstance,\n\n which the Regulations for grant of maternity leave have not\n\n contemplated. Therefore, in our view, keeping in mind the laudable\n\n objective of the maternity leave provision, the Respondents were not\n\n justified in denying the benefit of the maternity leave to the Petitioner\n\n No.2 only on the ground that if the child born from her first wedlock\n\n which is before the date of her joining Respondent No.2 is considered,\n\n then she is not entitled for the benefit on account of breaching the\n\n condition of having more than two surviving children.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_24\"> 16.          The role of the Court is to understand the purpose of law in\n\n society and to help the law achieve its purpose. When social reality\n\n changes, the law must change too. The Regulation with which we are\n\n concerned being beneficial Regulation, same should be interpreted\n\n liberally keeping in mind the objective and purpose for which same is\n\n engrafted.       The respect and protection of woman and of maternity\n\n should be raised to the position of an inalienable social duty and should\n\n become one of the principles of human morality.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_26\"> 17.

To become a\n\n mother is the most natural phenomenon in the life of a woman.\n\n Whatever is needed to facilitate the birth of child to a woman who is in\n\n service, the employer has to be considerate and sympathetic towards\n\n her and must realise the physical difficulties which a working woman\n\n would face in performing her duties at the workplace while carrying a\n\n baby in the womb or while rearing up the child after birth.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_27\"> 18.

The contention of the Respondents that since the Petitioner is\n\n a biological mother of more than two children and, therefore, she is not\n\n eligible for maternity benefit is not correct. The object of the Maternity\n\n Benefit Regulation which is posed for our consideration is not to curb\n\n the population but to give such benefit only on two occasions during the\n\n service period and, therefore, it is in that context that the condition of\n\n two surviving children is imposed.
