According to the petitioner, it is an NGO formed with a view\n\nto setting up feeding rooms, child care rooms and crèche at public\n\nplaces with the help of Government and public support. That one\n\nof its Directors, namely Advocate Neha Rastogi, realized the\n\nimpediments faced by nursing mothers when she gave birth to a\n\nchild. Her impediment was that she was afraid to go out in public\n\nbecause of the lack of facilities for feeding her child at public places\n\nand there was a sore need for breast-feeding rooms and child-care\n\nin all public places.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">\nPetitioner’s Submissions:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_5\">4.

Learned counsel further submitted that in today’s\n\nscenario, where women are equally participating in the growth of\n\nthe nation and are stepping outside their homes in large numbers,\n\nit is imperative that child-care facilities are available in the public\n\nspaces and premises. He submitted that it was not their case that\n\nthe governments have not done anything in this regard; they\n\nhighlighted different provisions of law which require setting up of\n\ncrèche facilities. However, the submission was that no concrete\n\nsteps have been taken by them to provide such basic facilities at\n\npublic places, and that nursing a child in an environment which is\n\nconducive to a mother’s dignity and privacy is a fundamental right.\n\nLearned counsel prayed that specific guidelines and/or directions\n\nmay be issued in respect of construction of baby feeding rooms and\n\nchild-care rooms at public places throughout the country.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_6\">5.

The Delhi\n\nHigh Court, vide order dated 06.11.2019, disposed of the petition\n\ndirecting the respondents therein to maintain the feeding rooms\n\nwhich have been made operational so far and it noted that it\n\nexpects more such feeding rooms/changing rooms to be made\n\noperational.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_7\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_8\">6.

In this regard, it is relevant here to discuss the importance of\n\nbreast-feeding for a child and the rights of nursing mothers.\n\nBreast-feeding is an integral component of a child’s right to life,\n\nsurvival, and development to the highest attainable standard of\n\nhealth. It is an integral part of a woman’s reproductive process and\n\nis essential for the health and well-being of both mother and the\n\nchild. Experts recommend that children be exclusively breast-fed\n\nfor the first six months of their life and from the age of six months,\n\nchildren     should       commence   consuming   safe   and    adequate\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">W.P.

This view is also supported by <a href=\"/doc/80427142/\" id=\"a_3\">Section\n\n5(a)</a> of the National Food Security Act, 2013.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_15\">10. Further, the health of infants cannot be viewed in isolation.\n\nRather, it has to be seen as being linked with the status of women\n\nand their roles as mothers and as contributors to social and\n\neconomic development of the nation. As the right of a child to be\n\nbreast-fed is inextricably linked with the mother, she also has the\n\nright to breast-feed her child. Consequently, this means that the\n\nState has the obligation to ensure adequate facilities and\n\nenvironment to facilitate mothers to breast-feed their children.\n\nSuch a right and the obligation emanate from <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_4\">Article 21</a> of the\n\nConstitution of India and the foundational principle of ‘the best\n\ninterest of the child’ as enshrined in international law as well as\n\nthe <a href=\"/doc/9677640/\" id=\"a_5\">Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015</a>.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_16\">11. Further, <a href=\"/doc/1139107/\" id=\"a_6\">Article 39(f)</a> of the Constitution of India requires the\n\nState to direct its policy towards the healthy development of\n\nchildren.

The State also has a duty to raise the level of nutrition and\n\nthe standard of living of its people. In this regard, <a href=\"/doc/1551554/\" id=\"a_7\">Article 47</a> of the\n\nConstitution of India provides as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">    “47.

It notes that, if breast-\n\nfeeding is increased to near universal levels, it could save more\n\nthan 8,20,000 lives every year. It raises concern over stigmatization\n\nregarding breast-feeding in public places and at workplaces as it\n\nexposed women to unnecessary stress, pressure or intimidation.\n\nAs regards the obligation of States, it noted as follows:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">    “We remind States of their obligations under relevant\n    international human rights treaties to provide all\n    necessary support and protection to mothers and their\n    infants and young children to facilitate optimal feeding\n    practices.
