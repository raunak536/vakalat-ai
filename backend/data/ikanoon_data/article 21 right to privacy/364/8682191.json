Before adverting to the submissions made by the counsels on\n\n     both sides, it is imperative to give a background of the ethos and\n\n     principles of secularism adopted in the Constitution of India.\n\n     Though the term ‘secular’ has a wide amplitude and has been\n\n     understood differently in different parts of the world, it is\n\n     important to comprehend the same in context of the Indian\n\n     Constitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_5\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_6\">3.   The word “secular” is now part of the Preamble of the\n\n     Constitution. What is meant by “Secular” (पंथ�नरपे� in the\n\n\n     Hindi version of the Constitution) needs to be discussed first. The\n\n     word ‘Secular’ was inserted in the Preamble of the Constitution\n\n     by the 42nd Amendment w.e.f. 3.1.1977. It is commonly\n\n     understood in contradistinction to the term ‘religious’. The\n\n     political philosophy of a secular government has been developed\n\n     in the West in the historical context of the pre-eminence of the\n\n     established Church and the exercise of power by it over the\n\n     society and its institutions. The democratic State thereafter\n\n     gradually replaced and marginalized the influence of the Church.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                                                      4</span>\n\f         The idea of secularism may have been borrowed in the Indian\n\n         Constitution from the West; however, it has adopted its own\n\n         unique brand based on its particular history and exigencies which\n\n         are far distinct in many ways from secularism as defined and\n\n         followed in European countries, the United States of America and\n\n         Australia. 1\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_7\">4.       The use of word ‘panthnirpeksh’ in the Constitution brings out\n\n         the     difference        in   the    terms       &quot;Dharmanirpeksh&quot;            and\n\n         &quot;Panthnirpeksh&quot;. ‘Panth’, or sect, symbolizes devotion towards\n\n         any specific belief, way of worship or form of God, but Dharma\n\n         symbolizes absolute and eternal values which can never change,\n\n         like the laws of nature. Dharma is what upholds, sustains and\n\n         results in the well-being and upliftment of the Praja (citizens)\n\n         and the society as a whole.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_9\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"49052391\" id=\"span_3\">5.       This   Court     in   a    judgment      reported     as    <a href=\"/doc/49052391/\" id=\"a_1\">A.S.    Narayana\n\n         Deekshitulu v. State of A.P. &amp; Ors.</a> 2 quoted the concept of\n\n         Dharma explained by Justice M. Rama Jois in his Legal and\n\n         Constitutional History of India as “it is most difficult to define\n\n         Dharma. Dharma has been explained to be that which helps the\n\n         upliftment of living beings. Therefore, that which ensures welfare\n\n         (of living beings) is surely Dharma. The learned rishis have\n\n         declared that which sustains is Dharma”.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"665015\" id=\"span_4\">This Court held that\n\n\n1    <a href=\"/doc/665015/\" id=\"a_2\">T.M.A. Pai Foundation v.

Likewise, when it is said that Dharmarajya is\n\n        necessary for the peace and prosperity of the people and for\n\n        establishing an egalitarian society, the word dharma in the\n\n        context of the word Rajya only means law, and Dharmarajya\n\n        means rule of law and not rule of religion or a theocratic State”.\n\n        Any action, big or small, that is free from selfishness, is part of\n\n        dharma. Thus, having love for all human beings is dharma. This\n\n        Court held as under:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">               “156. It is because of the above that if one were to ask\n               “What are the signs and symptoms of dharma?”, the\n               answer is: that which has no room for narrow-\n               mindedness, sectarianism, blind faith, and dogma. The\n               purity of dharma, therefore, cannot be compromised with\n               sectarianism. A sectarian religion is open to a limited\n               group of people whereas dharma embraces all and\n               excludes none. This is the core of our dharma, our psyche.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">               157. Nothing further is required to bring home the\n               distinction between religion and dharma; and so I say that\n               the word ‘religion’ in <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_3\">Articles 25</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_4\">26</a> has to be\n               understood not in a narrow sectarian sense but\n\n               encompassing our ethos of                       . Let us\n               strive to achieve this; let us spread the message of our\n               dharma by availing and taking advantage of the freedom\n               guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_5\">Articles 25</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_6\">26</a> of our Constitution.”\n\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">6.      This Court in Kesavananda Bharati v.

To it, all are equal and\n              all are entitled to be treated equally. How is this equal\n              treatment possible, if the State were to prefer or promote\n              a particular religion, race or caste, which necessarily\n              means a less favourable treatment of all other religions,\n              races and castes. How are the constitutional promises of\n              social justice, liberty of belief, faith or worship and\n              equality of status and of opportunity to be attained unless\n              the State eschews the religion, faith or belief of a person\n              from its consideration altogether while dealing with him,\n              his rights, his duties and his entitlements?

Therefore, in our view, the word “religion” should not\n     be misunderstood nor contention could be raised that as\n     it is used in the National Policy of Education, secularism\n     would be at peril. On the contrary, let us have a\n     secularistic democracy where even a very weak man\n     hopes to prevail over a very strong man (having post,\n     power or property) on the strength of rule of law by proper\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                                                                    11</span>\n\f            understanding of duties towards the society.

For this purpose also, if the basic tenets of all\n            religions over the world are learnt, it cannot be said that\n            secularism would not survive.”\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\">12.   In T.M.A. Pai Foundation, it was held that the State is not\n\n      prevented from making any law in relation to religious practice\n\n      and the same is permissible under <a href=\"/doc/1753683/\" id=\"a_14\">Article 25(2)(a)</a> of the\n\n      Constitution of India.

Thus, though the concept of secularism emerged in the west, it\n\n      has taken a different colour over the period of time.

Secularism, as\n\n      adopted under our Constitution, is that religion cannot be\n\n      intertwined with any of the secular activities of the State. Any\n\n      encroachment of religion in the secular activities is not\n\n      permissible. Secularism thus means treating all religions equally,\n\n      respecting all religions and protecting the practices of all\n\n      religions. The positive meaning of secularism would be non-\n\n      discrimination by the State on the basis of religious faith and\n\n      practices. Secularism can be practiced by adopting a completely\n\n      neutral approach towards religion or by a positive approach\n\n      wherein though the State believes and respects all religions, but\n\n      does not favour any.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_21\">\n\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_22\">14.

One of the arguments raised for such\n\n         submission was that it has to be decided as to what is considered\n\n         to be essentially religious, essential to religion and integral part\n\n         of religion. The contention was that “religion” is a means to\n\n         express one&#x27;s “faith”. The larger Bench of this Court framed the\n\n         questions of law in an order 12. However, the reasons 13 recorded\n\n         for the reference state the ambit to be “the contours of judicial\n\n         review in matters pertaining to essential religious practices”. The\n\n         questions referred to in the said case relate to the extent to\n\n         which the Court can inquire into the issue as to whether a\n\n\n\n11   (2020) 2 SCC 1\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">12</span>\n     (2020) 3 SCC 52\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">13</span>\n     (2020) 9 SCC 121\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">                                                                          24</span>\n\f      particular practice would be qualified as an integral, essential\n\n      part of religion.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_47\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_48\">25.   It was also argued that the present case involves a substantial\n\n      question of law relating to interpretation of the Constitution,\n\n      therefore, ought to be referred to a Constitution Bench in terms\n\n      of <a href=\"/doc/244297/\" id=\"a_68\">Article 145(3)</a> of the Constitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_49\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_50\">26.   It is noted that the review in Kantaru Rajeevaru (Right to\n\n      Religion, In Re-9J.) is to consider much wider questions. The\n\n      argument that the matter should be referred to a larger Bench\n\n      to be heard along with such referred cases does not warrant\n\n      consideration. The questions referred to the larger Bench relate\n\n      to power of judicial review in the matters of essential religious\n\n      practices. But the said question need not be examined in the\n\n      present matter as the issue herein is whether a religious practice,\n\n      which may be an essential religious practice, can be regulated\n\n      by the State in a secular institution. Therefore, I do not find it\n\n      necessary to tag the present appeals along with Kantaru\n\n      Rajeevaru.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_51\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_52\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"91938676\" id=\"span_34\">27.   The argument that the present appeals involve a substantial\n\n      question of law as to the interpretation of the Constitution, and\n\n      thus should be referred to the Bench of Five Judges in terms of\n\n      <a href=\"/doc/244297/\" id=\"a_69\">Article 145(3)</a> of the Constitution is not tenable. Reliance is\n\n      placed on a 9-Judges bench judgment reported as <a href=\"/doc/91938676/\" id=\"a_70\">K.<a href=\"/doc/59839349/\" id=\"a_71\">S.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">                                                                      25</span></a>\n\f          Puttaswamy and Anr. v. Union of India &amp; Ors.</a> 14, wherein\n\n          this Court held “When a substantial question as to the\n\n          interpretation of the Constitution arises, it is this Court and this\n\n          Court alone under <a href=\"/doc/244297/\" id=\"a_72\">Article 145(3)</a> that is to decide what the\n\n          interpretation of the Constitution shall be, and for this purpose,\n\n          the Constitution entrusts this task to a minimum of 5 Judges of\n\n          this Court”.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_53\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_54\">28.       There is no dispute about the proposition canvassed. The issue\n\n          in the present matter is however as to whether the students can\n\n          enforce their religious beliefs in a secular institution. Thus, the\n\n          issues raised do not become a substantial question of law as to\n\n          the interpretation of the Constitution only for the reason that the\n\n          right    claimed   by   the   appellants   is   provided   under   the\n\n          Constitution. Hence, I do not find the need to refer the matter to\n\n          a larger bench or that the same should be heard along with\n\n          Kantaru Rajeevaru.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_55\">\nQuestion (ii)- Whether the State Government could delegate its\ndecision to implement the wearing of uniform by the College\nDevelopment Committee or the Board of Management and whether the\nGovernment Order insofar as it empowers a College Development\nCommittee to decide on the restriction/prohibition or otherwise on\nheadscarves is ex facie violative of <a href=\"/doc/111199416/\" id=\"a_73\">Section 143</a> of the Act?\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_56\">29.

It is the contention of the\n\n      learned counsel for the appellants that the notification dated\n\n      31.1.2014 is to delegate the essential State functions in favour\n\n      of a non-statutory authority. Therefore, such notification violates\n\n      the mandate of <a href=\"/doc/111199416/\" id=\"a_75\">Section 143</a> of the Act. <a href=\"/doc/111199416/\" id=\"a_76\">Section 143</a> of the Act\n\n      reads thus:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_65\">            “143.

It is contended by the learned counsel for the appellants that the\n\n      power to maintain public order is the responsibility of the State\n\n      Government and, therefore, the State Government could not\n\n      delegate its authority to College Development Committee which\n\n      is not State within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_77\">Article 12</a> as it is a mechanism\n\n      created by the State.

Furthermore, learned counsels for the appellants have also\n\n      vehemently argued that the Government Order dated 5.2.2022\n\n      refers to some of the judgments which do not deal with the issue\n\n      of wearing hijab, but still it is concluded that use of headscarf or\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">                                                                              28</span>\n\f        a garment covering the head is not in violation of <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_78\">Article 25.</a> It\n\n        is averred that though the operative part of the order seems to\n\n        be facially religious-neutral, it targets a particular community in\n\n        effect. It is also contended that the High Court has supplanted\n\n        the reasons to uphold the said Government Order even though\n\n        the reasons recorded therein are not sufficient to prohibit the use\n\n        of headscarf.

The alternate argument is that the College Development\n\n        Committee, a non-statutory authority, cannot exercise power of\n\n        the State Government under Part III of the Constitution. It was\n\n        contended that the law which can restrict the right of an\n\n        individual under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_79\">Article 19(1)(a)</a>, <a href=\"/doc/555375/\" id=\"a_80\">Article 25(2)</a>, or any other right\n\n        falling within part III of the Constitution, can only be by way of\n\n        a law made by the competent legislature. Mr. Shoeb Alam\n\n        referred to judgments of this Court reported as <a href=\"/doc/766560/\" id=\"a_81\">State of\n\n        Madhya Pradesh &amp; Anr. v.

However, Mr. Dushyant Dave argued\n\n      that the rights in Part III of the Constitution can be restricted or\n\n      regulated by a statute made by competent legislature and also\n\n      includes any law as defined under <a href=\"/doc/772605/\" id=\"a_85\">Article 13(2)</a> <a href=\"/doc/1659104/\" id=\"a_86\">&amp; (3)</a> of the\n\n      Constitution. <a href=\"/doc/772605/\" id=\"a_87\">Articles 13(2)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1659104/\" id=\"a_88\">(3)</a> of the Constitution are\n\n      relevant for the purposes of the present proposition, which reads\n\n      thus:</span></span></span></span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_71\">              “13.

I do not find any merit in the said argument raised by the\n\n      appellants. The College Development Committee is envisaged to\n\n      be an in-house mechanism to ensure better utilization of grants\n\n      as well as maintaining academic standards and development of\n\n      infrastructure. Such directions are relatable to sub-section (3) of\n\n      <a href=\"/doc/191924952/\" id=\"a_89\">Sections 133</a> and <a href=\"/doc/79504007/\" id=\"a_90\">145</a> of the Act. In any case, the constitution of\n\n      the College Development Committee is not in conflict with any of\n\n      the provisions of the Act. The said circular was published in the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">                                                                             30</span>\n\f          Karnataka Gazette, issued in exercise of the executive powers of\n\n          the State, supplementing the provisions of the Act and not\n\n          supplanting all or any of the provisions thereof.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_75\">34.       The Government Order is in two parts. The first part is the\n\n          Preamble which gives the background leading to the order\n\n          impugned before the High Court. The second part, i.e., the\n\n          operative part of the order alone bears the Government Order\n\n          number and date. The order mandates that the uniform\n\n          prescribed by the College Development Committee or the Board\n\n          of Management should be worn. The appellants have though\n\n          understood the order to be interfering with their essential\n\n          religious practices.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_76\">35.       The executive power under <a href=\"/doc/883495/\" id=\"a_91\">Article 73</a> extends to all matters in\n\n          respect of which the Parliament has power to make laws or under\n\n          <a href=\"/doc/694670/\" id=\"a_92\">Article 162</a> in respect of the matters where legislature of the\n\n          State has power to make laws. 19 The question is whether\n\n          restrictions can be imposed by the executive in respect of the\n\n          rights specified under Part III such as <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_93\">Articles 19</a><a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_94\">, 21</a><a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_95\">, 25</a> and\n\n          <a href=\"/doc/660119/\" id=\"a_96\">31A.</a>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_77\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1318432\" id=\"span_47\">36.

As clause (b) is invalid, the direction made\n               against the appellant Bharatsingh under that clause\n               asking him to reside in Jhabua was clearly illegal and was\n               rightly quashed by the learned Single Judge.

The\n               learned Single Judge, therefore, rightly quashed the order\n               made against Bharatsingh directing him to notify his\n               movements and report himself daily to the Police Station\n               Officer, Jhabua, though he did so on the erroneous view\n               that clause (c) of <a href=\"/doc/54328797/\" id=\"a_106\">section 3(1)</a> was inextricably woven with\n               clause (b) thereof and was invalid.

The argument\n\n      raised by the appellant was that <a href=\"/doc/1426510/\" id=\"a_119\">Sections 3</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1755544/\" id=\"a_120\">10</a> and <a href=\"/doc/65490/\" id=\"a_121\">12</a> of the\n\n      Pharmacy Act confer the power to regulate, therefore, such\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_56\">                                                                               35</span>\n\f          power would include the power to prohibit also.

The curricula under <a href=\"/doc/146346996/\" id=\"a_150\">Section 7(2)</a> of the Act is to promote\n\n      harmony and the spirit of common brotherhood amongst all the\n\n      people of India transcending religious, linguistic and regional or\n\n      sectional diversities, to renounce practices derogatory to the\n\n      dignity of women, to value and preserve the rich heritage of our\n\n      composite culture, to develop scientific temper, humanism and\n\n      the spirit of inquiry and reform and to strive towards excellence\n\n      in all spheres of individual and collective activity, so that the\n\n      nation constantly rises to higher levels of endeavor and\n\n      achievement. The said provision is substantially pari materia\n\n      with the fundamental duties enumerated in Part IV-A of the\n\n      Constitution inserted by 42nd Amendment, required to be\n\n      followed by the institutions covered under the Act.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_92\">53.   The said provisions show that the mandate of the statute is to\n\n      renounce sectional diversities, to develop humanism and to\n\n      cultivate scientific and secular outlook. The sectarian approach\n\n      that certain students will carry their religious beliefs to secular\n\n      schools run by the State would be antithesis of the mandate of\n\n      the statute. All students need to act and follow the discipline of\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_68\">                                                                        40</span>\n\f      the school. Out of the many steps required to ensure uniformity\n\n      while imparting education, one of them is to wear the uniform\n\n      dress without any addition or subtraction to the same. Any\n\n      modification to the uniform would cease to be the uniform,\n\n      defeating the very purpose of prescribing under Rule 11 and as\n\n      mandated by the College Development Committee.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_93\">54.   Mr. Dushyant Dave referred to an extract which appears to be\n\n      from a booklet published by the Department of Pre-University\n\n      Education containing guidelines for the year 2021-2022. It is\n\n      contended that such guidelines have contemplated that uniform\n\n      is not mandatory and that some College Principals and\n\n      Management Committee have imposed uniforms as mandatory,\n\n      which is illegal. The relevant clause reads as under:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_88\">            “Uniform is not mandatory for students studying in Pre\n            University college under Government / Pre University\n            Education Department / <a href=\"/doc/115723854/\" id=\"a_151\">Education Act</a>. But some college\n            principals and management committee members have\n            imposed uniforms as mandatory which is illegal.

In respect of the said contention, I find that the students were\n\n      following uniform prescribed by the College Development\n\n      Committee. It is not the case of any of the students that they\n\n      were not wearing uniform for the academic session 2021-22.\n\n      The only claim raised was in relation to right to wear the\n\n      headscarf during the academic year 2021-22, the year in\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_69\">                                                                     41</span>\n\f      controversy, and to which the guidelines relate. The recognized\n\n      educational institution in terms of <a href=\"/doc/43688941/\" id=\"a_152\">Section 2(30)</a> of the Act\n\n      means an educational institution recognized under the Act and\n\n      includes one deemed to be recognized thereunder. The\n\n      recognition of educational institutions is contemplated by\n\n      <a href=\"/doc/90776181/\" id=\"a_153\">Section 36</a> of the Act whereas the educational institutions\n\n      established and run by the State Government or by the authority\n\n      sponsored by the Central or the State Government or by a local\n\n      authority and approved by the competent authority shall be\n\n      deemed to be the educational institution recognized under the\n\n      Act. The students are not disputing the mandate to wear\n\n      uniform. It appears that the guidelines have been made part of\n\n      the brochure without taking into consideration Rule 11 of the\n\n      Rules which contemplates that every recognised educational\n\n      institution may specify its own set of uniform. Therefore, the\n\n      guidelines run counter to the statutory Rule 11 framed in\n\n      exercise of the powers conferred under <a href=\"/doc/79504007/\" id=\"a_154\">Section 145</a> of the Act.\n\n      Thus, the uniform, having been prescribed in terms of the Act\n\n      and the rules framed thereunder, the guidelines to the contrary\n\n      are non-est and in any case had not been followed during the\n\n      academic year in question.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_95\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_96\">56.   The Government Order dated 5.2.2022 contemplates that the\n\n      prescribed uniform should be followed. It necessarily excludes all\n\n      religious symbols visible to naked eye.

In view of the above enunciation of law, I do not find that the\n\n      constitution of the College Development Committee contravenes\n\n      any of the provisions of the Act or the Rules made thereunder or\n\n      that the regulation of uniform by such Committee is beyond its\n\n      scope.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_99\">\n\nQuestion (iii)- What is the ambit and scope of right to freedom of\n‘conscience’ and ‘religion’ under <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_155\">Article 25?</a>\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_100\">58.

Political\n            democracy cannot last unless there lies at the base of it\n            social democracy. What does social democracy mean?

It is in these\n\n      circumstances that the Government issued the impugned order.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_128\">76.   It is contended that such directions were issued to the\n\n      colleges/institutions and not to the individual students as per the\n\n      mandate of the Act. The Preamble of the Act is to provide for the\n\n      planned development of educational institutions, inculcating\n\n      healthy educational practice, maintenance and improvement in\n\n      the standards of education, better organization, discipline and\n\n      control over educational institutions so as to cultivate a scientific\n\n      and secular outlook through education. <a href=\"/doc/101438362/\" id=\"a_174\">Section 133(2)</a> of the Act\n\n      empowers the State Government to give directions to any\n\n      educational institution as in its opinion are necessary or\n\n      expedient for carrying out the purposes of the Act. Therefore,\n\n      the   Government        Order   was     issued    to    direct    the\n\n      colleges/institutions   to   ensure   that   wherever   uniform    is\n\n      mandated by the College Development Committee or the Board\n\n      of Management, it should be worn. But if such uniform is not\n\n      mandated, the students should wear clothes which are in the\n\n      interest of unity, equality and public order. Therefore, the circular\n\n      was issued to the colleges to ensure compliance of norm of\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_85\">                                                                         53</span>\n\f      uniform in a non-discriminatory manner, irrespective of any\n\n      religious faith of the students.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_129\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_130\">77.   The legality of Rule 11 of the Rules is not under challenge. In\n\n      terms of the said Rule, the educational institutions have a right\n\n      to prescribe a uniform to the students attending the said school.\n\n      The scope of judicial review of the decisions of the educational\n\n      institutions vis-a-vis its pupil is narrower than a purely\n\n      administrative action.

The teachers are like foster parents who\n            are required to look after, cultivate and guide the students\n            in their pursuit of education. The teachers and the\n            institution exist for the students and not vice versa. Once\n            this principle is kept in mind, it must follow that it\n            becomes imperative for the teaching and other staff of an\n            educational institution to perform their duties properly,\n            and for the benefit of the students.........”\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_132\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1384048\" id=\"span_86\">78.

In <a href=\"/doc/86224/\" id=\"a_182\">Article 25(1)</a>, the term\n\n          ‘conscience’ needs to be given not only the widest connotation\n\n          but also an interconnected meaning. It is contended to be wide\n\n          enough to cover the use of hijab, which reflects an expression\n\n          of conscience. It is argued that the terms ‘conscience’, ‘profess’\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_93\">33</span>\n     (2016) 7 SCC 353\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_94\">                                                                                     57</span>\n\f      and ‘practice’, as occurring in <a href=\"/doc/86224/\" id=\"a_183\">Article 25(1)</a>, are distinct and at\n\n      the same time, interconnected.

So, religion is a matter of\n\n          belief and doctrine, concerning the human spirit, expressed\n\n          overtly in the form of ritual and worship. Some religions are\n\n          easily identifiable as religions; some are easily identifiable as\n\n          not religions.

This provision\n\n      affords to all persons freedom to beliefs which may not\n\n      necessarily be religious but which may spring from one’s\n\n      conscience. Freedom of religion, on the other hand, grants one\n\n      the right to follow one’s faith, the established form of which\n\n      gives a set of ethical norms to its followers and defines the\n\n      rituals, observances, ceremonies and modes of worship.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_146\">88.

Such right is not just subject to public order,\n\n      morality and health but also ‘other provisions of Part III’. This\n\n      would also include <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_194\">Article 14</a> which provides for equality before\n\n      law. In T.M.A. Pai Foundation, this Court reiterated that\n\n      <a href=\"/doc/86224/\" id=\"a_195\">Article 25(1)</a> is not only subject to public order, morality and\n\n      health, but also to other provisions of Part III of the\n\n      Constitution.

This right, however, is not absolute. The opening\n            words of <a href=\"/doc/86224/\" id=\"a_197\">Article 25(1)</a> make this right subject to public order,\n            morality and health, and also to the other provisions of Part\n            III of the Constitution. This would mean that the right given\n            to a person under <a href=\"/doc/86224/\" id=\"a_198\">Article 25(1)</a> can be curtailed or regulated\n            if the exercise of that right would violate other provisions of\n            Part III of the Constitution, or if the exercise thereof is not\n            in consonance with public order, morality and health.

The object of the Government Order was to ensure that there is\n\n      parity amongst the students in terms of uniform.

This is in tune with the right guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_199\">Article\n\n      14</a> of the Constitution. Hence, restrictions on freedom of religion\n\n      and conscience have to be read conjointly along with other\n\n      provisions of Part III as laid down under the restrictions of\n\n      <a href=\"/doc/86224/\" id=\"a_200\">Article 25(1).</a>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_149\">\nQuestion (iv) - What is the ambit and scope of essential religious\npractices under <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_201\">Article 25</a> of the Constitution?\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_150\">90.

To appreciate the argument raised, I firstly need to examine the\n\n        tenets of Muslim Law. In the Mulla’s Mohammedan Law, 5th\n\n        edition, 2019, it was stated that the Prophet Muhammad himself\n\n        declared that the Holy Quran was revealed to him by the angel\n\n        “Gabriel” in various portions and at different times. The texts are\n\n        held by Mohammedans to be decisive as being the words of God\n\n        transmitted to man through the Prophet. It is explained that\n\n        there are four sources of Mohammedan Law, namely, (1) the\n\n        Quran; (2) Hadis, i.e., precepts, actions and sayings of the\n\n        Prophet Muhammad, not written down during his lifetime, but\n\n        preserved by tradition and handed down by authorized persons;\n\n        (3) Ijmaa, i.e., a concurrence of opinion of the companions of\n\n        Muhammad and his disciples; and (4) Qiyas, being analogical\n\n        deductions derived from a comparison of the first three sources\n\n        when they do not apply to the particular case.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_157\">96.

Coming now to the arguments as to the violation of\n      the petitioners&#x27; fundamental rights, it will be convenient\n      to take up first the complaint founded on <a href=\"/doc/86224/\" id=\"a_219\">Article 25(1)</a>…\n\n      What then, we inquire, are the materials placed before us\n      to substantiate the claim that the sacrifice of a cow is\n      enjoined or sanctioned by Islam? …\n\n      ............ All that was placed before us during the\n      argument were Surah XXII, Verses 28 and 33, and Surah\n      CVIII. What the Holy book enjoins is that people should\n      pray unto the Lord and make sacrifice. We have no\n      affidavit before us by any Maulana explaining the\n      implications of those verses or throwing any light on this\n      problem. We, however, find it <a href=\"/doc/115701246/\" id=\"a_220\">laid down in</a> Hamilton&#x27;s\n      translation of Hedaya Book XLIII at p. 592 that it is the\n      duty of every free Mussulman, arrived at the age of\n      maturity, to offer a sacrifice on the Yd Kirban, or festival\n      of the sacrifice, provided he be then possessed of Nisab\n      and be not a traveller. The sacrifice established for one\n      person is a goat and that for seven a cow or a camel. It\n      is therefore, optional for a Muslim to sacrifice a goat for\n      one person or a cow or a camel for seven persons. It does\n      not appear to be obligatory that a person must sacrifice a\n      cow. The very fact of an option seems to run counter to\n      the notion of an obligatory duty. It is, however, pointed\n      out that a person with six other members of his family\n      may afford to sacrifice a cow but may not be able to afford\n      to sacrifice seven goats…We have, however, no material\n      on the record before us which will enable us to say, in the\n      face of the foregoing facts, that the sacrifice of a cow on\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_123\">                                                                     73</span>\n\f               that day is an obligatory overt act for a Mussalman to\n               exhibit his religious belief and idea.

The power to legislate in respect\n\n     of all secular activities was not accepted. The question examined\n\n     was the scope of clause (b) of <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_237\">Article 26</a> which speaks of\n\n     management of its own “affairs in matters of religion.” The\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_131\">                                                                     77</span>\n\flanguage undoubtedly suggests that there could be other affairs\n\nof a religious denomination or a section thereof which are not\n\nmatters of religion and to which the guarantee given by this\n\nclause would not apply. The question is, where is the line to be\n\ndrawn between what are matters of religion and what are not.

The result then is that there are two provisions of\n               equal authority, neither of them being subject to the\n               other. The question is how the apparent conflict between\n               them is to be resolved. The rule of construction is well\n               settled that when there are in an enactment two\n               provisions which cannot be reconciled with each other,\n               they should be so interpreted that, if possible, effect could\n               be given to both.

In deciding the question as to whether a given\n                 religious practice is an integral part of the religion or not,\n                 the test always would be whether it is regarded as such\n                 by the community following the religion or not. This\n                 formula may in some cases present difficulties in its\n                 operation. Take the case of a practice in relation to food\n                 or dress.….. This question will always have to be decided\n                 by the Court and in doing so, the Court may have to\n                 enquire whether the practice in question is religious in\n                 character and if it is, whether it can be regarded as an\n                 integral or essential part of the religion, and the finding\n                 of the Court on such an issue will always depend upon the\n                 evidence adduced before it as to the conscience of the\n                 community and the tenets of its religion.

Essential part\n      of a religion means the core beliefs upon which a religion\n      is founded. Essential practice means those practices that\n      are fundamental to follow a religious belief. It is upon the\n      cornerstone of essential parts or practices that the\n      superstructure of a religion is built, without which a\n      religion will be no religion. Test to determine whether a\n      part or practice is essential to a religion is to find out\n      whether the nature of the religion will be changed without\n      that part or practice. If the taking away of that part or\n      practice could result in a fundamental change in the\n      character of that religion or in its belief, then such part\n      could be treated as an essential or integral part. There\n      cannot be additions or subtractions to such part because\n      it is the very essence of that religion and alterations will\n      change its fundamental character.

Such alterable parts or practices are definitely not\n               the “core” of religion whereupon the belief is based and\n               religion is founded upon.

In the Constitution Bench judgment reported as Young\n\n        Lawyers Association &amp; Ors.

In    clause    (1),   <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_267\">Article     25</a>   protects\n               the equal entitlement of all persons to a freedom of\n               conscience and to freely profess, protect and propagate\n               religion. By conferring this right on all persons, the\n               Constitution emphasises the universal nature of the right.\n               By all persons, the Constitution means exactly what it\n               says : every individual in society without distinction of any\n               kind whatsoever is entitled to the right. By speaking of an\n               equal entitlement, the Constitution places every\n               individual on an even platform. Having guaranteed\n               equality before the law and the equal protection of laws\n               in <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_268\">Article 14</a>, the draftspersons specifically continued the\n               theme of an equal entitlement as an intrinsic element of\n               the freedom of conscience and of the right to profess,\n               practise and propagate religion. There are three defining\n               features of clause (1) of <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_269\">Article 25 :</a> first, the entitlement\n               of all persons without exception, second, the recognition\n               of an equal entitlement; and third, the recognition both of\n               the freedom of conscience and the right freely to profess,\n               practise and propagate religion. The right under <a href=\"/doc/86224/\" id=\"a_270\">Article\n               25(1)</a> is evidently an individual right for, it is in the\n               individual that a conscience inheres. Moreover, it is the\n               individual who professes, practises and propagates\n               religion. Freedom of religion in <a href=\"/doc/86224/\" id=\"a_271\">Article 25(1)</a> is a right\n               which the Constitution recognises as dwelling in each\n               individual or natural person.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_205\">\n\n52   (2019) 11 SCC 1\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_142\">                                                                               84</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_206\">\f209. Yet, the right to the freedom of religion is not\nabsolute. For the Constitution has expressly made it\nsubject to public order, morality and health on one hand\nand to the other provisions of Part III, on the other. The\nsubjection of the individual right to the freedom of religion\nto the other provisions of the Part is a nuanced departure\nfrom the position occupied by the other rights to freedom\nrecognised in <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_272\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_273\">, 15</a><a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_274\">, 19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_275\">21.</a> While\nguaranteeing equality and the equal protection of laws in\n<a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_276\">Article 14</a> and its emanation, in <a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_277\">Article 15</a>, which prohibits\ndiscrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or\nplace of birth, the Constitution does not condition these\nbasic norms of equality to the other provisions of Part III.\nSimilar is the case with the freedoms guaranteed by\n<a href=\"/doc/1142233/\" id=\"a_278\">Article 19(1)</a> or the right to life under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_279\">Article 21.</a> The\nsubjection of the individual right to the freedom of religion\nunder <a href=\"/doc/86224/\" id=\"a_280\">Article 25(1)</a> to the other provisions of Part III was\nnot a matter without substantive content. Evidently, in the\nconstitutional order of priorities, the individual right to the\nfreedom of religion was not intended to prevail over but\nwas subject to the overriding constitutional postulates of\nequality, liberty and personal freedoms recognised in the\nother provisions of Part III.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_207\">210. Clause (2) of <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_281\">Article 25</a> protects laws which existed\nat the adoption of the Constitution and the power of the\nState to enact laws in future, dealing with two categories.\nThe first of those categories consists of laws regulating or\nrestricting economic, financial, political or other secular\nactivities which may be associated with religious\npractices. Thus, in sub-clause (a) of <a href=\"/doc/555375/\" id=\"a_282\">Article 25(2)</a>, the\nConstitution has segregated matters of religious practice\nfrom secular activities, including those of an economic,\nfinancial or political nature. The expression “other secular\nactivity” which follows upon the expression “economic,\nfinancial, political” indicates that matters of a secular\nnature may be regulated or restricted by law. The fact\nthat these secular activities are associated with or, in\nother words, carried out in conjunction with religious\npractice, would not put them beyond the pale of\nlegislative regulation. The second category consists of\nlaws providing for (i) social welfare and reform; or (ii)\nthrowing open of Hindu religious institutions of a public\ncharacter to all classes and sections of Hindus. The\nexpression “social welfare and reform” is not confined to\nmatters only of the Hindu religion. .........”\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_143\">                                                                  85</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_208\">\f116. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1508089\" id=\"span_144\">In <a href=\"/doc/1508089/\" id=\"a_283\">Bijoe Emmanuel v.

I find that religion is not to be understood in a narrow\n\n      sectarian sense but by encompassing our ethos that all should\n\n      be treated alike. Secular State means rising above all\n\n      differences of religions, and attempting to secure the good of all\n\n      its citizens irrespective of their religious beliefs and practices.\n\n      The faith or belief of a person is immaterial from the point of\n\n      view of the State. For the State, all are equal and all are entitled\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_150\">                                                                        89</span>\n\f        to be treated equally.

Secularism is thus more than\n\n        a passive attitude of religious tolerance. It is a positive concept\n\n        of equal treatment of all religions. Therefore, the object of the\n\n        State is to bridge the gap between different sections of the\n\n        society and to harmonize the relationship between the citizens\n\n        to ensure growth of community in all spheres i.e., social,\n\n        economic and political.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_216\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_217\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"437931\" id=\"span_151\">122.

During the course of examining historical\n            facts, legislation on the ‘Sikh religion’, the “Sikh\n            rehatmaryada”. the “Sikh ardas” and the views of authors and\n            scholars of the Sikh religion, we arrived at the conclusion that\n            wearing and carrying of “kirpans” though an important and\n            significant aspect of the Sikh religion, is nowhere close to the\n            importance and significance of maintaining hair unshorn.

Mishra does not\n               emerge as the only available interpretation of Islamic law\n               on a matter of theology. Hence, in the given set of facts\n               and circumstances, it is inappropriate for this Court to\n               enter upon an area of theology and to assume the role of\n               an interpreter of the Hadees. The true test is whether\n               those who believe and worship have faith in the religious\n               efficacy of the place where they pray. The belief and faith\n               of the worshipper in offering namaz at a place which is for\n               the worshipper a mosque cannot be challenged. It would\n               be preposterous for this Court to question it on the ground\n               that a true Muslim would not offer prayer in a place which\n               does not meet an extreme interpretation of doctrine\n               selectively advanced by Mr Mishra. This Court, as a\n               secular institution, set up under a constitutional regime\n               must steer clear from choosing one among many possible\n               interpretations of theological doctrine and must defer to\n               the safer course of accepting the faith and belief of the\n               worshipper.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_158\">               91. Above all, the practise of religion, Islam being no\n               exception, varies according to the culture and social\n               context.

In the plural\n               diversity of religious beliefs as they are practised in India,\n               cultural assimilation cannot be construed as a feature\n               destructive of religious doctrine. On the contrary, this\n               process strengthens and reinforces the true character of\n               a country which has been able to preserve its unity by\n               accommodating, tolerating and respecting a diversity of\n               religious faiths and ideas. There can be no hesitation in\n               rejecting the submission made by Mr Mishra.

There is no dispute about the proposition canvassed. The\n\n      practice of wearing of hijab may be a ‘religious practice’ or an\n\n      ‘essential religious practice’ or it may be social conduct for the\n\n      women of Islamic faith. The interpretations by the believers of\n\n      the faith about wearing of headscarf is the belief or faith of an\n\n      individual. The religious belief cannot be carried to a secular\n\n      school maintained out of State funds. It is open to the students\n\n      to carry their faith in a school which permits them to wear Hijab\n\n      or any other mark, may be tilak, which can be identified to a\n\n      person holding a particular religious belief but the State is within\n\n      its jurisdiction to direct that the apparent symbols of religious\n\n      beliefs cannot be carried to school maintained by the State from\n\n      the State funds. Thus, the practice of wearing hijab could be\n\n      restricted by the State in terms of the Government Order.\n\n\n\nQuestion (v)- Whether fundamental rights of freedom of\nexpression under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_305\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> and right of privacy under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_306\">Article\n21</a> mutually exclusive or are they complementary to each other; and\nwhether the Government Order does not meet the injunction of\nreasonableness for the purposes of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_307\">Article 21</a> and <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_308\">Article 14?</a>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_224\">126.

It is submitted that there cannot be any law which prohibits such\n\n      expression as long as it does not disturb the public order or\n\n      violates the accepted norms of decency and morality as\n\n      prescribed by law. It is contended that it is the responsibility of\n\n      the State to protect the composite culture of India, but the same\n\n      has been intervened through the Government Order, contrary to\n\n      the rights enshrined in the Constitution. The argument is also as\n\n      to whether, this right to express herself by wearing a hijab, stops\n\n      at the school gate and that beyond the school gate, she has no\n\n      right to express herself to convey to others that she embraces a\n\n      certain culture and she wishes to identify herself with that\n\n      culture. Such expression, at the time when the notification was\n\n      issued, neither had the tendency to, nor was there any evidence\n\n      to show that it, in any way, disturbed public order, or was\n\n      violative of decency or morality. The rights and duties conferred\n\n      under the aforementioned provisions transcends the boundaries\n\n      of the school gate. A citizen or student does not forego her\n\n      fundamental rights and protections guaranteed under the\n\n      Constitution, which includes the freedom to express her culture,\n\n      the moment she steps into the school premises. It is also\n\n      submitted that wearing an article of clothing, reflecting the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_157\">                                                                       94</span>\n\f        distinct culture of a citizen, is consistent with the fundamental\n\n        right of a citizen to conserve her culture under <a href=\"/doc/421731/\" id=\"a_309\">Article 29(1)</a> and\n\n        it is the fundamental duty of citizens to preserve and protect that\n\n        culture which is part of the rich heritage of India.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_226\">128.

It\n\n        is also argued that the State Government has not mentioned the\n\n        role of Popular Front of India in the order passed, therefore, the\n\n        State Government is not justified to refer to Popular Front of\n\n        India during the course of arguments.

The Constitution does not contain a\nseparate article telling us that privacy has been declared to\nbe a fundamental right.

Likewise, liberty without equality or\n     fraternity, can well result in the perpetuation of existing\n     inequalities and worse, result in licence to indulge in\n     society&#x27;s basest practices.

The impugned Government Order was said to be an anti-thesis\n\n        of   diversity,   though    based     upon    misunderstood       fraternal\n\n        behavior when it is asserted that all the school students studying\n\n        in the State of Karnataka should behave in a fraternal manner,\n\n        transcend their group identity and develop an orientation\n\n        towards social justice. It is argued that the Government Order\n\n        suggests that the ethic of fraternity is best served by complete\n\n        erasure of all differences. It does not mean ‘flattening out of\n\n        differences’, or forced assimilation. Reference was made to a\n\n        judgment of this Court reported as Tehseen S.

It was also argued that the\n\n        Government Order uses the words ‘unity’ and ‘uniformity’\n\n        interchangeably and that uniformity is not a constitutional or\n\n        statutory mandate, and has no nexus with unity.

That is the idea and essence of our nation\nwhich cannot be, to borrow a line from Rabindranath\nTagore, “broken up into fragments by narrow domestic\nwalls” of caste, creed, race, class or religion. Pluralism\nand tolerance are essential virtues and constitute the\nbuilding blocks of a truly free and democratic society. It\nmust be emphatically stated that a dynamic\ncontemporary constitutional democracy imbibes the\nessential feature of accommodating pluralism in thought\nand approach so as to preserve cohesiveness and unity.\nIntolerance arising out of a dogmatic mindset sows the\nseeds of upheaval and has a chilling effect on freedom of\nthought and expression.

Thus, the\n\n     schools must give students the privacy and the freedom to think\n\n     about their choices. Therefore, the Government Order creates an\n\n     arbitrary barrier to education and to fraternal spaces.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_287\">155. Not disputing with the above observations, it is important to\n\n     interpret the expressions ‘fraternity’ and ‘dignity’ in view of the\n\n     objective   behind   the   Government    Order. The   concept    of\n\n     fraternity and dignity do not stand alone but have to be inferred\n\n     from the context, circumstances and the purpose sought to be\n\n     achieved. There is no dispute, as asserted in the written\n\n     submissions, that the purpose of introducing fraternity as a\n\n     constitutional value is to invoke horizontal or social sensitivity\n\n     towards inequalities, in addition to the vertical, or top-down\n\n     political prescriptions towards inequalities. Fraternity is in fact\n\n     social sensitivity. The students herein are in the age group of 15\n\n     to 18 years. The seed of education should germinate equally\n\n     amongst all students. Therefore, the Preambular goal of justice,\n\n     liberty, equality or fraternity would be better served by removing\n\n     any religious differences, inequalities and treating students alike\n\n     before they attain the age of adulthood.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_191\">                                                                     116</span><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_288\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_289\">\f156. The students have been given a uniform platform to grow and\n\n     take quantum leap in their further pursuits.

Still further, the Hindi word of fraternity is “बंधुत्व” that is\n\n\n     brotherhood. Brotherhood is amongst all the citizens of the\n\n     Country and not of a particular community. Fraternity is the\n\n     antithesis of a segmented society wherein all humans are treated\n\n     equally and their innate genius is allowed an outlet by exposing\n\n     them to equal opportunities.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_292\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_293\">158. The argument is that the appellants seek equal access to public\n\n     education where they would have the opportunity to fraternize\n\n     across religious, class and gender boundaries, an opportunity\n\n     which would not be available to them if they were to transfer to\n\n     religious schools. Hence, the Government Order has created an\n\n     arbitrary barrier to education and to fraternal spaces.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_294\">159. I do not find any merit in the argument raised. Fraternity is a\n\n     noble goal but cannot be seen from the prism of one community\n\n     alone. It is a goal for all citizens of the country irrespective of\n\n     caste, creed, sex and religion. The abstract idea of fraternity, as\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_192\">                                                                    117</span>\n\f     discussed in the judgments referred to by learned counsel for\n\n     the appellants, has to be applied to the ground realities wherein\n\n     some students wearing headscarf in a secular school run by the\n\n     State   Government    would    stand   out   and   overtly   appear\n\n     differently. The concept of fraternity will stand fragmented as the\n\n     apparent distinction of some of the students wearing headscarf\n\n     would not form a homogenous group of students in a school\n\n     where education is to be imparted homogeneously and equally,\n\n     irrespective   of    any   religious   identification   mark. The\n\n     Constitutional goal of fraternity would be defeated if the students\n\n     are permitted to carry their apparent religious symbols with\n\n     them to the classroom. None of the judgments referred to by the\n\n     learned counsel for the appellants deal with an issue of fraternity\n\n     in respect of a section of the citizens who wish to carry their\n\n     religious symbols to a classroom. The Constitutional goal as\n\n     emanating from the Preamble would not be achieved if fraternity\n\n     is given a narrow meaning in respect of the students identifying\n\n     themselves with the religious symbols in the classroom.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_295\">160.

Once the\n\n     uniform is prescribed, all students are bound to follow the\n\n     uniform so prescribed. The uniform is to assimilate the students\n\n     without any distinction of rich or poor, irrespective of caste, creed\n\n     or faith and for the harmonious development of the mental and\n\n     physical faculties of the students and to cultivate a secular\n\n     outlook. The wearing of hijab is not permitted only during the\n\n     school time, therefore, the students can wear it everywhere else\n\n     except in schools. The wearing of anything other than the\n\n     uniform is not expected in schools run by the State as a secular\n\n     institution. In a secular school maintained at the cost of the\n\n     State, the State is competent to not permit anything other than\n\n     the uniform.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_301\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_302\">165. The argument that the wearing of a headscarf provides dignity\n\n     to the girl students is also not tenable. The students are\n\n     attending an all-girls’ college.

The argument is that hijab is an additional cloth worn on the\n\n     head, and that it does not cause any harm to any other person.\n\n     The argument is based upon Conscience &amp; Religion (<a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_383\">Article 25</a>),\n\n     Culture (<a href=\"/doc/1888152/\" id=\"a_384\">Articles 29</a> and <a href=\"/doc/246741/\" id=\"a_385\">51-A(f)</a>), Identity (<a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_386\">Articles 19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_387\">21 -</a>\n\n     Autonomy, Dignity, Choice) and Secularism (<a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_388\">Articles 19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_389\">21 -</a>\n\n     Autonomy, Dignity, Choice), therefore, the students have been\n\n     wrongly denied admission to an educational institution on the\n\n     basis of religion.

The State has not denied admission to the students from\n\n      attending classes. If they choose not to attend classes due to the\n\n      uniform that has been prescribed, it is a voluntary act of such\n\n      students and cannot be said to be in violation of <a href=\"/doc/1888152/\" id=\"a_395\">Article 29</a> by the\n\n      State. It is not a denial of rights by the State but instead a\n\n      voluntary act of the students. It would thus not amount to denial\n\n      of right to education if a student, by choice, does not attend the\n\n      school. A student, thus, cannot claim the right to wear a\n\n      headscarf to a secular school as a matter of right.\n\n\n\nQuestion (viii)- Whether a student-citizen in the constitutional\nscheme is expected to surrender her fundamental rights under\n<a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_396\">Articles 19</a><a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_397\">, 21</a> and <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_398\">25</a> as a pre-condition for accessing education in a\nState institution?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_311\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_312\">170. Mr. Shoeb Alam argued that in the Constitutional scheme, there\n\n      cannot be any barter of fundamental rights for the enjoyment of\n\n      a privilege or a right.

This Court held that in this situation, the\n\n     condition which involves surrender is as effective a deterrent to\n\n     the exercise of the right under <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_405\">Article 30(1)</a> as a direct\n\n     prohibition would be. Thus considered, it is apparent that the\n\n     religious minority does not voluntarily waive its right — it has\n\n     been coerced because of the basic importance of the privilege\n\n     involved, namely, affiliation. This Court held as under:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_189\">           “161. It is doubtful whether the fundamental right under\n           <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_406\">Article 30(1)</a> can be bartered away or surrendered by any\n           voluntary act or that it can be waived. The reason is that the\n           fundamental right is vested in a plurality of persons as a unit\n           or if we may say so, in a community of persons necessarily\n           fluctuating. Can the present members of a minority\n           community barter away or surrender the right under the\n           article so as to bind its future members as a unit? The\n           fundamental right is for the living generation. By a voluntary\n           act of affiliation of an educational institution established and\n           administered by a religious minority the past members of the\n           community cannot surrender the right of the future members\n           of that community. The future members of the community\n           do not derive the right under <a href=\"/doc/1687408/\" id=\"a_407\">Article 30(1)</a> by succession or\n           inheritance.”\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_316\">173.

The argument of the appellants is however that they are seeking\n\n     reasonable accommodation by the school authorities to permit\n\n     them to attend school wearing matching headscarf/hijab in\n\n     addition to the prescribed uniform which would be in conformity\n\n     with the fundamental rights guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_414\">Article 25</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_415\">21</a>\n\n     of the Constitution.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_198\">182.

In Bijoe\n\n     Emmanuel, it has been held that the real test of a true\n\n     democracy is the ability of even an insignificant minority to find\n\n     its identity under the Constitution. In the aforesaid case,\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_213\">                                                                          130</span>\n\f     students, believer of Jehovah, expressed their inability to sing\n\n     National Anthem though they were extending all respect when\n\n     the National Anthem was to be played. In the case of the\n\n     appellants, democracy is not in test but the question is whether\n\n     the school, having prescribed the uniform, has a right to insist\n\n     that all students wear the same uniform so as not to have\n\n     inequality or disparity in the matter of wearing of uniform. Rule\n\n     11 in fact shows that any change in uniform can be affected only\n\n     after serving notice to the parents and once uniform is\n\n     prescribed, it cannot be changed in five years, meaning thereby\n\n     that there is a continuity of the uniform and the period for which\n\n     uniform is prescribed is to be followed.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_199\">183.

Therefore, the judgments of other countries\n\n     having different social structure and polity would not provide a\n\n     reasonable basis to determine the question of religious practices\n\n     in such a wide and varied country like ours.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_331\">185.

If a particular student\n\n      feels that she cannot compromise with the wearing of headscarf\n\n      or of any other student to wear any outwardly religious symbol,\n\n      the school would be justified not to allow such student, in the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_217\">                                                                           134</span>\n\f        larger interest of treating all the students alike as a part of\n\n        mandate of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_435\">Article 14</a>, which is central to the theme of Part III\n\n        of the Constitution.

The\n\n        right to education is thus a part of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_439\">Article 21.</a> The State has not\n\n        put any restriction to avail such right of education. The right of\n\n        education is available to every student. The State has only\n\n        regulated the right in a manner that students come to the school\n\n        to attend classes only in the prescribed uniform, and the same\n\n        has been done to achieve the statutory and constitutional goals.\n\n        The students cannot assert that they have a right to education\n\n\n\n\n79   (2012) 6 SCC 1\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_219\">                                                                      135</span>\n\f      but they would avail such right as per their own wish and in the\n\n      manner which they consider appropriate. Schools are to prepare\n\n      the students for their future endeavors in life. Discipline is one\n\n      of the attributes which the students learn in schools. Defiance to\n\n      rules of the school would in fact be antithesis of discipline which\n\n      cannot be accepted from the students who are yet to attain\n\n      adulthood. Therefore, they should grow in an atmosphere of\n\n      brotherhood and fraternity and not in the environment of rebel\n\n      or defiance. The argument that the school is insisting on\n\n      surrendering or curtailing the right to wear a headscarf as a pre-\n\n      condition to access the education is not tenable as the right to\n\n      education is available but only condition is that the students\n\n      should attend the classes in prescribed uniform.</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_341\">192.

In fact, the Act itself contemplates providing of opportunities and\n\n      facilities in a healthy manner and maintaining the dignity of\n\n      childhood and youth so that there is no moral or material\n\n      abandonment. The uniform for the students has been prescribed\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_220\">                                                                     136</span>\n\f      so that there is no distinction between the students coming from\n\n      diverse background and that each student grows in an\n\n      environment of equality, fairness and equal opportunities. The\n\n      uniform is an equalizer of inequalities. Therefore, prescribing\n\n      uniform for children at an impressionable age is not only\n\n      important but has a salutary effect on the mental development\n\n      of the child to grow in the environment of oneness. The said\n\n      object is in tune with <a href=\"/doc/1139107/\" id=\"a_442\">Article 39(f)</a> of the Constitution of India\n\n      which reads as thus:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_200\">           “39(f) that children are given opportunities and facilities\n           to develop in a healthy manner and in conditions of\n           freedom and dignity and that childhood and youth are\n           protected against exploitation and against moral and\n           material abandonment.”\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_343\">194. Hence, the Government Order cannot be said to be contrary to\n\n      the State goal of promoting literacy and education as mandated\n\n      under the Constitution. The Government Order only ensures that\n\n      the uniform prescribed is adhered to by the students and it\n\n      cannot be said that State is restricting the access to education\n\n      to the girl students through such an Order.\n\n\n\nQuestion (xi)- Whether the Government Order neither achieves\nany equitable access to education, nor serves the ethic of secularism,\nnor is true to the objective of the <a href=\"/doc/105740875/\" id=\"a_443\">Karnataka Education Act</a>?\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_344\">195. The argument is that the State is under a positive obligation to\n\n      create an environment conducive for the exercise of fundamental\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_221\">                                                                         137</span>\n\frights. Conversely, it means that the subjects have no\n\nresponsibility to create a conducive environment in a non-\n\ndiscriminatory manner. If the students of one faith insist on a\n\nparticular dress, there is no stopping for the others to carry their\n\nfaiths and beliefs to the schools. It would not be conducive to the\n\npious atmosphere of the school where the students seek\n\nadmission for education. In fact, uniform fosters a sense of\n\n‘equality’ amongst students- instills a sense of oneness,\n\ndiminishes individual differences, helps focus on learning as\n\nstudents would not be bothered about their social status,\n\nimproves discipline, fewer conflicts in school, promotes school\n\nspirit- generates a sense of belonging, pride, loyalty towards the\n\nschool, relieves economic pressure on the parents, ensures\n\nequality before the educational institution, serves the need of a\n\ndiverse community and promotes a positive sense of communal\n\nidentity and does not lead to the growth of disparities of wealth\n\nand style. School is the time to learn and lay foundation for the\n\nfuture pursuits in life. The students are expected to maintain\n\ndiscipline and the school is responsible to lay a strong foundation\n\nso as to nurture the students as responsible citizens of the\n\ncountry.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_345\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_222\">                                                                138</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_346\">\f196. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"55820570\" id=\"span_223\">In <a href=\"/doc/55820570/\" id=\"a_444\">Indibly Creative Private Ltd. &amp; Ors. v.

Political freedoms\n               impose a restraining influence on the State by carving out\n               an area in which the State shall not interfere. Hence,\n               these freedoms are perceived to impose obligations of\n               restraint on the State. But, apart from imposing\n               “negative” restraints on the State these freedoms impose\n               a positive mandate as well. In its capacity as a public\n               authority enforcing the rule of law, the State must ensure\n               that conditions in which these freedoms flourish are\n               maintained.

The Judgement impugned before this Court was\n\n             pronounced by the Karnataka High Court on March 15,\n\n             2022. This was challenged before this Court in several\n\n             SLP’s.

In the district of Udupi in Karnataka there is a small\n\n     town called Kundapura. Aishat Shifa and Tehrina Begum\n\n     were the two second year students of Government Pre-\n\n     University College in Kundapura. They both follow Islam\n\n     religion and wear hijab. According to them they have\n\n     been wearing hijab, inside their classrooms, ever since\n\n     they joined the college, more than a year back. They\n\n     say that in the past they had never faced any objection\n\n     from anyone, including the college administration and\n\n     their wearing of hijab inside their classroom was never\n\n     an issue.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_361\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_362\">6.

Since they refused to take off their hijab, they\n\n     were denied entry in the college, by the college\n\n     administration.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_363\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_232\">                             6</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_364\">\f7.         The next day that is February 4, 2022, both made a\n\n     representation before the Deputy Commissioner Udupi,\n\n     praying that direction be given to the college authorities\n\n     to let them enter their college and complete their\n\n     studies. No effective orders were passed by the Deputy\n\n     Commissioner, but instead the Government came up\n\n     with an Order on February 5, 2022. This G.O has a\n\n     Preamble, which refers to the <a href=\"/doc/105740875/\" id=\"a_450\">Karnataka Education Act,\n\n     1983</a> and the Rules framed therein, from where it draws\n\n     its powers and then cites three Judgments of different\n\n     High Courts to conclude that prohibiting hijab does not\n\n     amount to a violation of <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_451\">Article 25</a> of the Constitution. It\n\n     then mandates that the Government schools must have\n\n     a school uniform and the colleges which come under\n\n     the     jurisdiction    of     the      Pre-University     Education\n\n     Department the uniform which is prescribed by the\n\n     College      Development           Committees    (in     Government\n\n     colleges),    and      Board       of   Management       (in   private\n\n     schools), should be worn. There was, however, a caveat,\n\n     which said that in the event the Board of Management\n\n     did not mandate any uniform then students should wear\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_233\">                                    7</span>\n\f     clothes that are “in the interest of unity, equality and\n\n     public order.”\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_365\">8.

Since hijab was not made a part of the ‘uniform,’ and\n\n     wearing it was not ‘in the interest of unity, equality and\n\n     public order,’ as the G.O.    mandated, the Petitioners\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_234\">                             8</span>\n\f  were denied entry in their school.

The two girls, who were the students were then\n\n  constrained to file Writ Petitions before the Karnataka\n\n  High Court. Initially the case went before a learned\n\n  Single Judge of the High Court, who in turn, considering\n\n  the importance of the matter, referred it to the Chief\n\n  Justice for constituting a larger bench. A three-judge\n\n  bench was constituted by the Chief justice, which has\n\n  heard the matter at length and then passed its orders\n\n  on March 15, 2022, dismissing the Writ Petitions, an\n\n  order which is presently impugned before this Court.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_372\">11.     Before the Karnataka High Court as well as before\n\n  this Court the main argument of the Petitioners was\n\n  that the G.O. dated February 5, 2022, and the\n\n  restrictions imposed by the school authorities in not\n\n  permitting the Petitioners to wear hijab inside their\n\n  classrooms amounts to a violation of their Fundamental\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_235\">                          9</span>\n\f  Rights given to them under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_454\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/86224/\" id=\"a_455\">Article\n\n  25(1)</a> of the Constitution of India as well as under\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_203\">  <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_456\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_457\">21</a> of the Constitution. Some of the\n\n  Petitioners also raised a claim that wearing of hijab is a\n\n  part of their Essential Religious Practice. The argument\n\n  of the State on the other hand would be that the G.O\n\n  only directs the school authorities of respective schools\n\n  to prescribe a school uniform. It is an innocuous order,\n\n  which is religion neutral. As to the argument on\n\n  Fundamental Rights, the reply was that Fundamental\n\n  Rights are not absolute and they are always subject to\n\n  reasonable    restrictions.   Prohibiting        hijab   inside   a\n\n  classroom is a reasonable restriction. Wearing of hijab\n\n  was also said to be not an Essential Religious Practice.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_373\">12.

As far as the first question is concerned the High\n\n  Court has given a finding that wearing of hijab by\n\n  Muslim women does not form a part of Essential\n\n  Religious Practice in Islamic faith. On the second\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_237\">                              11</span>\n\f           question it was held that prescription of school uniform\n\n           places     only    a   reasonable   restriction   which   is\n\n           Constitutionally permissible and cannot be objected by\n\n           the students. As regards the third, i.e., the G.O of 5\n\n           February 2022 it was again held that the Government\n\n           has powers to issue such an order and no case is made\n\n           out for its invalidation. The fourth point was also given\n\n           in the negative.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_375\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_376\">       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"619152\" id=\"span_238\">14.           One of the grounds raised by the Petitioners in\n\n           their challenge to the validity of the G.O. dated\n\n           February 5, 2022 is that it is merely an Executive Order.\n\n           But it has far reaching consequences as far as\n\n           curtailment of Fundamental Rights of the Petitioner are\n\n           concerned given to her under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_463\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/86224/\" id=\"a_464\">25(1)</a>\n\n           of the Constitution. It was submitted that the settled\n\n           position of law is that restrictions on Fundamental\n\n           Rights can only be imposed by a statutory law and not\n\n           by executive order. The decision of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/619152/\" id=\"a_465\">Kharak\n\n           Singh v. State of Uttar Pradesh2</a> was relied upon.\n\n           This submission, however, is not correct and therefore\n\n2 (1964) 1 SCR 332\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_239\">                                     12</span>\n\f             declined. The reasons being, that under <a href=\"/doc/191924952/\" id=\"a_466\">Section 133</a> <a href=\"/doc/77704392/\" id=\"a_467\">3</a> of\n\n             the Karnataka Education Act, 1983 the Government has\n\n             powers to give directions. <a href=\"/doc/79504007/\" id=\"a_468\">Section 145</a> of the 1983 Act\n\n             gives the State Government powers to make Rules,\n\n             which have been made and are called the Karnataka\n\n             Educational Institutions (Classification, Regulation and\n\n             Prescription of Curricula Etc.,) Rules, 1995. Rule 11(1), 4\n\n             of      the      above          Rules’          states        that       the       recognized\n\n             educational                institutions              can         prescribe              uniform.\n\n             Therefore, the State Government in any case has\n\n             powers to prescribe a uniform/dress code. Therefore,\n\n             the submissions that the G.O is not a valid law is not\n\n             correct. The G.O draws its source from the statue and\n\n             the statutory rules. Therefore, it has the force of law.\n\n             Nevertheless, the fact remains that it still has to pass\n\n\n3 ‘133.

Out of the four questions formulated by the\n\n  Karnataka High Court the first question is in fact the\n\n  crucial one. Everything depended on the determination\n\n  on this question. But then the Court had set a very tall\n\n  order for the Petitioners to prove their case. The\n\n  Petitioners had to prove that wearing of hijab forms a\n\n  core belief in the religion of Islam. ERP also meant that\n\n  such a practice should be fundamental to follow as a\n\n  religious belief or practice as ERP was held to be the\n\n  foundation, on which the superstructure of the religion\n\n  was erected. Essential Religious Practice would mean a\n\n  practice without which religion would not remain the\n\n  same religion. Also, the Petitioners had to prove that the\n\n  practice of wearing hijab is a practice which is being\n\n  followed since the very beginning of their religion. This\n\n  was the task set up for the Petitioners to prove their\n\n  case. But this was not enough, this was only the\n\n  threshold requirement. The Petitioners also had to prove\n\n  that the ERP does not militate against any of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_241\">                          14</span>\n\f            Constitutional values. This perhaps was right, because\n\n            an ERP which is an invasion on the Fundamental Rights\n\n            of others will not be given the protection. The Court\n\n            held as follows5:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_208\">                      “…There is absolutely no material\n                      placed on record to prima facie show\n                      that wearing of hijab is a part of an\n                      essential religious practise in Islam\n                      and that the Petitioners have been\n                      wearing hijab from the beginning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_209\">                      This apart, it can hardly be argued\n                      that hijab being a matter of attire,\n                      can     be    justifiably  treated   as\n                      fundamental to Islamic faith. It is not\n                      that if the alleged practise of wearing\n                      hijab is not adhered to, those not\n                      wearing hijab become the sinners,\n                      Islam loses its glory and it ceases to\n                      be a religion. Petitioners have\n                      miserably failed to meet the threshold\n                      requirement of pleadings and proof as\n                      to wearing hijab is an inviolable\n                      religious practice in Islam and much\n                      less a part of ‘essential religious\n                      practice’…”\n\n\n             As      the       Petitioners   did   not   meet   the   threshold\n\n             requirement, the High Court did not feel it necessary to\n\n             touch on the aspect of Constitutional Values. Therefore,\n\n             they stated that :-\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_210\">                           “It hardly needs to be stated that if\n                           Essential Religious Practice as a\n                           threshold requirement is not satisfied\n\n5 Para XII at Page 87 of the Judgement\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_242\">                                             15</span>\n\f           then the case would by extension not\n           travel to the merits surrounding the\n           domain     of  those    Constitutional\n           Values.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_381\">16.      The Judgement then upholds the validity of the\n\n  G.O dated February 5, 2022 and holds that the\n\n  authorities have power to prescribe uniform in schools.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_382\">17.      In my opinion, the question of Essential Religious\n\n  Practices, which we have also referred in this judgement\n\n  as ERP, was not at all relevant in the determination of\n\n  the dispute before the Court. I say this because when\n\n  protection   is   sought    under   <a href=\"/doc/86224/\" id=\"a_471\">Article   25(1)</a>   of   the\n\n  Constitution of India, as is being done in the present\n\n  case, it is not required for an individual to establish that\n\n  what he or she asserts is an ERP. It may simply be any\n\n  religious practice, a matter of faith or conscience! Yes,\n\n  what is asserted as a Right should not go against\n\n  “public order, morality and health,” and of course, it is\n\n  subject to other provisions of Part III of the Constitution.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_383\">18.      Partly, the Petitioners had to be blamed for the\n\n  course taken by the Court as it was indeed the\n\n  Petitioners or some of the Petitioners who had claimed\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_243\">                             16</span>\n\f            that wearing of hijab is an essential practice in Islam.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_384\">            Before us, however, when arguments were raised at the\n\n            Bar, some of the Counsels did admit that ERP was not\n\n            the core issue in the matter, but the Petitioners before\n\n            the Karnataka High Court had no choice as they were,\n\n            inter alia, attacking the Government Order dated 5\n\n            February 2022, which clearly stated that prohibiting\n\n            hijab in schools will not be violative of <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_472\">Article 25</a> of the\n\n            Constitution of India. Be that as it may, the fact remains\n\n            that the point was raised. It was made the core issue by\n\n            the Court, and it went against the Petitioners.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_385\">        19.           The approach of the High Court could have been\n\n            different. Instead of straightaway taking the ERP route,\n\n            as a threshold requirement, the Court could have first\n\n            examined whether the restriction imposed by the school\n\n            or the G.O on wearing a hijab, were valid restrictions?\n\n            Or whether these restrictions are hit by the Doctrine of\n\n            Proportionality.       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1508089\" id=\"span_244\">In <a href=\"/doc/1508089/\" id=\"a_473\">Bijoe Emmanuel and Ors. vs\n\n            State of Kerala and Ors</a> 6. this is what the Court had\n\n            to say:</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_386\">                            “…Therefore,        whenever    the\n                            Fundamental     Right to freedom of\n\n6 1986 3 SCC 615; Para 19\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_245\">                                           17</span>\n\f           conscience and to profess, practice and\n           propagate religion is invoked, the act\n           complained of as offending the\n           Fundamental Right must be examined\n           to discover whether such act is to\n           protect public order, morality and\n           health, whether it is to give effect to the\n           other provisions of Part III of the\n           Constitution or whether it is authorized\n           by a law made to regulate or restrict\n           any economic, financial, political or\n           secular    activity    which    may      be\n           associated with religious practice or to\n           provide for social welfare and reform. It\n           is the duty and function of the court so\n           to do.”\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_387\">20.     Be that as it may, let us examine as to how and\n\n  what the entire concept of Essential Religious Practice\n\n  has been defined by this Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_388\">21.    The test of ERP has been <a href=\"/doc/1508089/\" id=\"a_474\">laid down by</a> this Court in\n\n  the past to resolve disputes of a particular nature,\n\n  which we shall discuss in a while. By and large these\n\n  were the cases where a challenge was made to State\n\n  interference on what was claimed to be an “ essential\n\n  religious practice.” What was raised was the protection\n\n  of <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_475\">Article 25</a> as well as <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_476\">Article 26</a> of the Constitution of\n\n  India. In other words, these were the cases where both\n\n  <a href=\"/doc/86224/\" id=\"a_477\">Article 25 (1)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1456610/\" id=\"a_478\">(2)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_479\">Article 26</a> were in play.\n\n  Essentially, these were the cases where the rituals and\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_246\">                          18</span>\n\f            practices of a denomination or a sect of a particular\n\n            religion sought protection against State intervention.\n\n            <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"115701246\" id=\"span_247\">Even when Rights of an individual were raised, as we\n\n            may say in the case of <a href=\"/doc/115701246/\" id=\"a_480\">Shayara Bano v.

In the\n\n            case at hand, the question is not merely of religious\n\n            practice or identity but also of ‘freedom of expression,’\n\n            given to a citizen under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_481\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the\n\n            Constitution of India, and this makes this case different.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_389\">        22.

The\n\nRajasthan High Court had substantially allowed their\n\nclaim and against the said order the Dargah Committee\n\nwas before the Supreme Court. The questions which fell\n\nfor consideration before this Court was whether any\n\nperson as a Sunni Muslim could manage the affairs of\n\nthe Durgah or whether this could only be done by the\n\nfollowers of Chishti Silsila. There were some other\n\nquestions as well, which would not be relevant for\n\ndiscussion in the context of this decision.

Whether wearing hijab is an ERP in\n\n  Islam or not is not essential for the determination of this\n\n  dispute.

The Karnataka High Court, however, has made a\n\n  detailed study as to what is ERP and whether wearing a\n\n  hijab constitutes a part of ERP in Islam.        Suras and\n\n  verses from the Holy Quran have been referred and\n\n  explained, and then taking assistance of a commentary\n\n  on the Holy Book, the High Court concludes that\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_269\">                            30</span>\n\f  wearing of hijab is not an essential religious practice in\n\n  Islam and at best it is directory in nature, not\n\n  mandatory.

Apart from the fact that ERP was not essential to\n\n  the determination of the dispute, which we have\n\n  already said above, there is another aspect which is\n\n  even more important, which would explain as to why\n\n  the Courts should be slow in the matters of determining\n\n  as to what is an ERP. In my humble opinion Courts are\n\n  not the forums to solve theological questions. Courts\n\n  are not well equipped to do that for various reasons, but\n\n  most importantly because there will always be more\n\n  than one viewpoint on a particular religious matter, and\n\n  therefore nothing gives the authority to the Court to\n\n  pick one over the other. The Courts, however, must\n\n  interfere when the boundaries set by the Constitution\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_270\">                           31</span>\n\f            are      broken,      or   where   unjustified   restrictions   are\n\n            imposed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_405\">        37.          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1318432\" id=\"span_271\">In the case of M.

Let us now look into the facts of that case:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_221\">               Three girl children in Kerala who belonged to a faith\n\n               called        Jehovah’s           Witnesses,   were   attending   a\n\n               government school. Every morning when the National\n\n               Anthem was sung in the school these three students\n\n               used to respectfully stand up for the National Anthem,\n\n               like other children in the school; but they did not sing\n\n               the National Anthem. They did so as their faith forbid\n\n               them to sing for anyone else but Jehovah. Initially this\n\n               was not noticed but then someone complained before\n\n               the highest authority in the State, which led to the\n\n               expulsion of these three children from their school, by\n\n               orders passed by the Deputy Inspector of schools and\n\n               then the Headmistress of the school. The children filed\n\n               their Writ Petition before the Kerala High Court which\n\n               was dismissed by the learned Single Judge as also\n\n               their appeal by a division bench of Kerala High Court.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_222\">               They finally approached the Supreme Court of India\n\n\n20 Para X1(iii) at Page 85 of the Impugned Judgement\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_277\">                                                       35</span>\n\f      and filed their Special Leave Petition before this Court.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_414\">      Their case was simple: they do not show disrespect to\n\n      the National Flag or the National Anthem. They stand\n\n      respectfully when the National Anthem is sung, they\n\n      only do not participate in singing as they sincerely\n\n      believe their faith forbids them to sing for anyone but\n\n      Jehovah.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_415\">41.          The Petition of these three girl children was\n\n  dismissed by the Kerala High Court as the Kerala High\n\n  Court did not find any word or thought in the Indian\n\n  National Anthem which could offend anyone’s religious\n\n  susceptibilities. Hence the Kerala High Court concluded\n\n  that there was absolutely no reason for the children not\n\n  to sing the national anthem! While examining their case\n\n  Justice O. Chinnappa Reddy, who wrote this Judgement\n\n  for the Court rejected the approach of the High Court\n\n  and said that the High Court had actually misdirected\n\n  itself in doing so and it went off at a tangent. The\n\n  objection of the Petitioners was not to the language of\n\n  the National Anthem, but they simply refused to sing\n\n  any National Anthem, irrespective of any country as\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_278\">                            36</span>\n\f           they sincerely believe that this is what their religion\n\n           prescribes them to do.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_416\">       42.             The Supreme Court then cites two judgements of\n\n           the United States Supreme Court, which we must refer\n\n           here as well, since they relate to schools and the\n\n           ‘discipline’ imposed by the schools. The first is the case\n\n           of Minersville School District v. Gobitis21 and the\n\n           second is West Virginia State Board of Education v.\n\n           Barnette22. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1508089\" id=\"span_279\">While referring to the two judgement(s) my\n\n           source shall remain the <a href=\"/doc/1508089/\" id=\"a_538\">Judgement of Bijoe Emmanuel</a>\n\n           (supra).</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_417\">       43.         In Minersville (supra) the question was whether\n\n           compulsory saluting of the National Flag infringed upon\n\n           the liberties guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment\n\n           of the Constitution of the United States of America. The\n\n           majority opinion delivered by Justice Frankfurter upheld\n\n           the requirement on grounds that such decisions are to\n\n           be left to the school boards. Justice Stone gave his\n\n           dissent and said,\n\n                        “History teaches us that there have been\n                        but few infringements of personal liberty\n21 310 US 586 (1940)\n22 319 US 624 (1943)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_280\">                                      37</span>\n\f                          by the State which have not been\n                          justified, as they are here, in the name of\n                          righteousness and the public good, and\n                          few which have not been dictated, as\n                          they are now, at politically helpless\n                          minorities23.”\n\n\n             In short, the US Supreme Court did not interfere in the\n\n             compulsory saluting of the National Flag in a Public\n\n             School.        The        reference   of   this   case,   is   however,\n\n             important here as very soon this decision was overruled\n\n             by the Supreme Court in the case of Barnetta (supra)\n\n             which is the second case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_418\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_419\">         44.

Coming back to the order of Karnataka High Court\n\n            there is another finding which is difficult to accept. This\n\n            is where the High Court determines that the Petitioners\n\n            cannot         assert       their      Fundamental   Rights   inside   a\n\n            classroom which the Court terms as “qualified public\n\n            places” and the rights inside a school are only\n\n            “derivative right.” The court states as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_228\">                  “It hardly needs to be stated that schools\n                  are qualified public places that are\n                  structured predominantly for imparting\n                  educational instructions to the students.\n                  Such qualified Spaces by their very\n                  nature repeal the assertion of individual\n                  rights to the detriment of the general\n                  discipline and decorum. Even the\n                  substantive         rights       themselves\n                  metamorphise into a kind of derivatives\n                  rights in such places.”25\n\n\n25 Para XIV (iv) at Page 100 of the Impugned Judgement\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_288\">                                                   42</span>\n\f        The Hight Court rejects the case of the Petitioners on\n\n        ‘reasonable accommodation,’ and also the argument that\n\n        schools are a showroom for diversity of culture, for reason\n\n        that the schools being ‘ qualified public places’ schoolgirls\n\n        have to follow the dress code, which does not prescribe\n\n        hijab. It says:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_229\">                       “It hardly needs to be stated the\n                       content and scope of a right, in terms of\n                       its   exercise    are   circumstantially\n                       dependent.

The\n                       extent of autonomy is enormous at\n                       home, since ordinarily resident of a\n                       person is treated as his inviolable\n                       castle. However, in qualified public\n                       places like schools, courts, war rooms,\n                       defense camp, etc., the freedom of\n                       individuals as of necessity, is curtailed\n                       consistent with the discipline and\n                       decorum and function and purpose26.”\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_426\">        51.                Comparison of a school with a war room or\n\n            defense camp, seems odd, to say the least. Schools are\n\n            not required to have the discipline and regimentation of\n\n            a military camp. Nevertheless, in my understanding,\n\n            what the High Court wanted to convey was that all\n\n            public places have a certain degree of discipline and\n\n\n26 Para XIV (vii) at Page 104 of the Impugned Judgement\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_289\">                                                   43</span>\n\f  limitations and the degree of enjoyment of a Right by\n\n  an individual inside his house or anywhere outside a\n\n  public space is different to what he or she would enjoy\n\n  once they are inside a public space. As a general\n\n  principle, one can have no quarrel with this proposition.\n\n  But then let us come to the facts of the case. Laying\n\n  down a principle is one thing, justifying that to the facts\n\n  of a case is quite another. We must be a judge of fact as\n\n  well as a judge of law. Do the facts of the case justify\n\n  the restrictions inside a classroom, which is admittedly\n\n  a public place? In my opinion there is no justification for\n\n  this.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_427\">52.       School is a public place, yet drawing a parallel\n\n  between a school and a jail or a military camp, is not\n\n  correct. Again, if the point which was being made by the\n\n  High Court was regarding discipline in a school, then\n\n  that must be accepted. It is necessary to have discipline\n\n  in schools. But discipline not at the cost of freedom, not\n\n  at the cost of dignity. Asking a pre university schoolgirl\n\n  to take off her hijab at her school gate, is an invasion on\n\n  her privacy and dignity. It is clearly violative of the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_290\">                          44</span>\n\f            Fundamental Right given to her under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_553\">Article 19(1)(a)</a>\n\n            and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_554\">21</a> of the Constitution of India. This right to her\n\n            dignity27 and her privacy28 she carries in her person,\n\n            even inside her school gate or when she is in her\n\n            classroom. It is still her Fundamental Right, not a\n\n            “derivative right” as has been described by the High\n\n            Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_428\">        53.              In the Puttaswamy judgement (supra), Justice\n\n            D.Y.      Chandrachud in Paragraph 298 of his Judgement\n\n            says as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_230\">                    ‘298. Privacy of the individual is an essential\n                    aspect of dignity. Dignity has both an intrinsic\n                    and instrumental value. As an intrinsic value,\n                    human dignity is an entitlement or a\n                    constitutionally protected interest in itself. In its\n                    instrumental facet, dignity and freedom are\n                    inseparably      intertwined,   each    being       a\n                    facilitative tool to achieve the other. The ability\n                    of the individual to protect a zone of privacy\n                    enables the realisation of the full value of life\n                    and liberty. Liberty has a broader meaning of\n                    which privacy is a subset. All liberties may not\n                    be exercised in privacy. Yet others can be\n                    fulfilled only within a private space. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"91938676\" id=\"span_291\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"43475503\" id=\"span_292\">Privacy\n                    enables the individual to retain the autonomy of\n                    the body and mind. The autonomy of the\n                    individual is the ability to make decisions on\n                    vital matters of concern to life. Privacy has not\n                    been couched as an independent fundamental\n                    right. But that does not detract from the\n                    constitutional protection afforded to it, once the\n27 <a href=\"/doc/43475503/\" id=\"a_555\">Maneka Gandhi vs Union of India and Anr.</a> [(1978) 1 SCC 248]; <a href=\"/doc/91938676/\" id=\"a_556\">Para 85\n28 K.S.

Privacy lies across the\nspectrum of protected freedoms. The guarantee\nof equality is a guarantee against arbitrary\nState action. It prevents the State from\ndiscriminating      between      individuals.   The\ndestruction by the State of a sanctified personal\nspace whether of the body or of the mind is\nviolative of the guarantee against arbitrary\nState action. Privacy of the body entitles an\nindividual to the integrity of the physical\naspects of personhood. The intersection\nbetween one&#x27;s mental integrity and privacy\nentitles the individual to freedom of thought,\nthe freedom to believe in what is right, and the\nfreedom of self-determination. When these\nguarantees intersect with gender, they create a\nprivate space which protects all those elements\nwhich are crucial to gender identity. The family,\nmarriage, procreation and sexual orientation\nare all integral to the dignity of the individual.</span></span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_429\">Above all, the privacy of the individual\nrecognises an inviolable right to determine how\nfreedom shall be exercised. An individual may\nperceive that the best form of expression is to\nremain silent. Silence postulates a realm of\nprivacy. An artist finds reflection of the soul in a\ncreative endeavour. A writer expresses the\noutcome of a process of thought. A musician\ncontemplates upon notes which musically lead\nto silence. The silence, which lies within,\nreflects on the ability to choose how to convey\nthoughts and ideas or interact with others.\nThese are crucial aspects of personhood. The\nfreedoms under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_557\">Article 19</a> can be fulfilled where\nthe individual is entitled to decide upon his or\nher preferences. Read in conjunction with\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_558\">Article 21</a>, liberty enables the individual to have\na choice of preferences on various facets of life\nincluding what and how one will eat, the way\none will dress, the faith one will espouse and a\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_294\">                    46</span>\n\f      myriad other matters on which autonomy and\n      self-determination require a choice to be made\n      within the privacy of the mind. The\n      constitutional right to the freedom of religion\n      under <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_559\">Article 25</a> has implicit within it the ability\n      to choose a faith and the freedom to express or\n      not express those choices to the world. These\n      are some illustrations of the manner in which\n      privacy facilitates freedom and is intrinsic to the\n      exercise of liberty. The Constitution does not\n      contain a separate article telling us that privacy\n      has been declared to be a fundamental right.\n      Nor have we tagged the provisions of Part III\n      with an alpha-suffixed right to privacy: this is\n      not an act of judicial redrafting. Dignity cannot\n      exist without privacy. Both reside within the\n      inalienable values of life, liberty and freedom\n      which the Constitution has recognised. Privacy\n      is the ultimate expression of the sanctity of the\n      individual. It is a constitutional value which\n      straddles across the spectrum of fundamental\n      rights and protects for the individual a zone of\n      choice and self-determination.’\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_430\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1201493\" id=\"span_295\">54.

The object of the act therefore was the\n\n  betterment of education and to inculcate a sense of\n\n  discipline among school going children.

We would now be examining some decisions of\n\n  foreign Courts as in order to appreciate the assertion of\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_308\">                          50</span>\n\f  religious and cultural rights in our school premises, it\n\n  would be worthwhile to refer to some of the similar\n\n  controversies which had come up before the Courts of\n\n  other Countries which have a Constitutional Democracy.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_431\">  There are two cases which I would like to refer here. The\n\n  first case is the ‘nose-stud’ case of the Constitutional\n\n  Court of South Africa and the second one is a decision\n\n  of the House of Lords in England.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_432\">56.     The South African case though has to be seen in\n\n  the background of the Constitutional Law of South Africa\n\n  where dignity is a right given to its citizens under its\n\n  Constitution. Equality Courts have also been established\n\n  in South Africa to hear the disputes relating to cases of\n\n  discrimination. But nevertheless, the basic principle and\n\n  the law remains the same.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_433\">57.     Sunali was a student of Class 10 in Durban Girls\n\n  High School (DGHS). The Code of Conduct of the school\n\n  prohibited wearing jewellery in school. When Sunali was\n\n  in class 10, her mother gave her a nose stud to wear,\n\n  which was not a fashion statement, but a part of\n\n  Sunali’s Hindu-Tamil culture. The school objected to the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_309\">                         51</span>\n\f            nose-stud and Sunali was asked to remove it. When\n\n            Sunali refused to remove the nose stud her mother was\n\n            called. Her mother reasoned with the authorities that\n\n            this is a part of her Hindu-Tamil culture and it cannot be\n\n            removed. Ultimately, Sunali through her mother had to\n\n            file a Petition before the Equality Court, where such\n\n            matters of discrimination are heard since Sunali had\n\n            alleged discrimination by her school. The Equality Court\n\n            held that though a prima facie case for discrimination\n\n            had been made out, it could not be termed as ‘unfair’ 30,\n\n            thus dismissing her case. Thereafter, the matter was\n\n            taken in appeal before the High Court which allowed her\n\n            appeal and held that asking Sunali to remove her nose\n\n            stud amounts to discrimination which is wrong. Both the\n\n            school and the administration went to the Constitutional\n\n            Court which heard the matter and again decided in\n\n            favour of Sunali.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_434\">        58.             As to the argument of the school that nose stud\n\n            was not central to Sunali’s religion or culture and it is\n\n            only an optional practice, this is what was said by the\n\n            Constitutional Court, the Highest Court of South Africa:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_236\">30 Para 14 at Page 14 of the Judgement\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_310\">                                         52</span>\n\f“86. The School further argued that the\nnose stud is not central to Sunali’s\nreligion or culture, but it is only an\noptional practice. I agree that the\ncentrality of a practice or a belief must\nplay a role in determining how far\nanother party must go to accommodate\nthat belief. The essence of reasonable\naccommodation is an exercise of\nproportionality. Persons who merely\nappear to adhere to a religious and/or\ncultural practice, but who are willing to\nforego it if necessary, can hardly\ndemand the same adjustment from\nothers as those whose identity will be\nseriously undermined if they do not\nfollow their belief. The difficult question\nis how to determine centrality. Should we\nenquire into centrality of the practice or\nbelief to the community, or to the\nindividual?\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_237\">87. While it is tempting to consider the\nobjective importance or centrality of a\nbelief to a particular religion or culture in\ndetermining whether the discrimination\nis fair, that approach raises many\ndifficulties. In my view, courts should not\ninvolve themselves in determining the\nobjective centrality of practices, as this\nwould require them to substitute their\njudgement of the meaning of a practice\nfor that of the person before them and\noften to take sides in bitter internal\ndisputes. This is true both for religious\nand cultural practices. If Sunali states\nthat the nose stud is central to her as a\nSouth Indian Tamil Hindu, it is not for the\nCourt to tell her that she is wrong\nbecause others do not relate to that\nreligion or culture in the same way.”\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_311\">                 53</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_435\">\f59.    What was also pleaded on behalf of the School was\n\n  that the nose stud after all is a cultural and not a\n\n  religious issue and therefore the infringement of any\n\n  right, if at all, is much less. This issue was dealt with as\n\n  follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_238\">         “91. The next string of the School’s\n         centrality bow was that the infringement\n         of Sunali’s right to equality is less severe\n         because the nose stud is cultural rather\n         than a religious adornment. This was also\n         the basis originally relied upon by the\n         School for refusing the exemption and\n         why it could recognise the stud’s cultural\n         significance without granting Sunali an\n         exemption. To my mind the argument is\n         flawed. As stated above, religious and\n         cultural   practices    can    be    equally\n         important to a persons’ identity. What is\n         relevant is not whether a practice is\n         characterised as religious or cultural but\n         its meaning to the person involved.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_239\">        92. The School also argued that if Sunali\n        did not like the Code, she could simply go\n        to another school that would allow her to\n        wear the nose stud. I cannot agree. In my\n        view the effect of this would be to\n        marginalise     religions   and   cultures,\n        something that is completely inconsistent\n        with the values of our Constitution. As\n        already noted, out Constitution does not\n        tolerate diversity as a necessary evil, but\n        affirms it as one of the primary treasures\n        of our nation. There may, however, be\n        occasions where the specific factual\n        circumstances make the availability of\n        another school a relevant consideration in\n        searching        for      a     reasonable\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_312\">                          54</span>\n\f                      accommodation. However, there are no\n                      such circumstances in this case and the\n                      availability of another school is therefore\n                      not a relevant consideration.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_436\">       60.           Ultimately what was held is given below as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_240\">                      “112. The discrimination has had a\n                      serious impact on Sunali and, although\n                      the evidence shows that uniforms serve\n                      an important purpose, it does not show\n                      that   the    purpose     is   significantly\n                      furthered    by    refusing    Sunali   her\n                      exemption. Allowing the stud would not\n                      have imposed an undue burden on the\n                      School A reasonable accommodation\n                      would have been achieved by allowing\n                      Sunali to wear the nose stud. I would\n                      therefore confirm the High Court’s\n                      finding of unfair discrimination.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_437\">       61.              The other case, which was also relied by the\n\n            Karnataka High Court is Regina (SB) v. Governors of\n\n            Denbigh High School31. Primarily the controversy was\n\n            that the school, allowed wearing of hijab, but what was\n\n            further insisted was wearing of jilbab (which is more or\n\n            less a burqa). Jilbab was denied and this led to the\n\n            litigation where the restriction of the school on jilbab\n\n            was upheld. In this background we must appreciate the\n\n            observations of the Court, it was said:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_241\">                  “But schools are different. Their task is to\n                  educate the young from all the many and\n                  diverse families and communities in this\n                  country in accordance with the national\n\n31 [2007] 1 AC 100\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_313\">                                       55</span>\n\f        curriculum. Their task is to help all of\n        their pupils achieve their full potential.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_438\">        This includes growing up to play whatever\n        part they choose in the society in which\n        they are living. The school’s task is also to\n        promote the ability of people of diverse\n        races, religions and cultures to live\n        together in harmony. Fostering a sense of\n        community and cohesion within the\n        school is an important part of that. A\n        uniform dress code can play its role in\n        smoothing over ethnic, religious and\n        social divisions. But it does more than\n        that. Like it or not, this is a society\n        committed, in principle and in law, to\n        equal freedom for men and women to\n        choose how they will lead their lives\n        within the law. Young girls from ethnic,\n        cultural or religious minorities growing up\n        here face particularly difficult choices:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_242\">        how far to adopt or to distance\n        themselves from the dominant culture.

When a decision has to be made between school\n\n  discipline and cultural and religious rights of minorities\n\n  a balance has to be maintained. That is what was held.\n\n  Baroness Hale of Richmond while elaborating on this\n\n  issue referred to “Culture, Religion and Gender” (2003)\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_314\">                          56</span>\n\fby Professor Frances Raday the exact Paragraph at 98\n\nwhich reads like this:\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_440\">      “genuine     individual    consent    to    a\n      discriminatory practice or dissent from it\n      may not be feasible where these girls are\n      not yet adult. The question is whether\n      patriarchal family control should be\n      allowed to result in girls being socialised\n      according to the implications of veiling\n      while still attending public educational\n      institutions . . . A mandatory policy that\n      rejects veiling in state educational\n      institutions may provide a crucial\n      opportunity for girls to choose the\n      feminist freedom of state education over\n      the patriarchal dominance of their\n      families. Also for the families, such a\n      policy may send a clear message that the\n      benefits of state education are tied to the\n      obligation to respect women’s and girl’s\n      right to equality and freedom . . . On the\n      other hand, a prohibition of veiling\n      risks violating the liberal principle of\n      respect for individual autonomy and\n      cultural diversity for parents as well\n      as students.

The facts of the case were quite different. The\n\n            issue being examined was whether the State of Oregon\n\n            was justified in denying unemployment benefits to\n\n            persons who had been dismissed from their jobs owing\n\n            to their consumption of “peyote,” which had been\n\n            classified         as       a       ‘controlled   substance’     (under       the\n\n            Controlled Substances Act, 1970), when it was being\n\n            consumed             as         a     part   of   religious    beliefs.       The\n\n            consumption of peyote was admittedly a criminal\n\n            offence. It was contended by the respondents that as it\n32 315 F. Supp. 94 (N.D. Ill. 1969)\n33 313 F.

This argument was rejected\n\nand it was held that if certain conduct (such as\n\nconsumption of peyote), which is prohibited by law,\n\nthen there would be no federal right to engage in such\n\nconduct. It was in this particular context of the\n\napplicability of the criminal law on an individual for a\n\nconduct already prohibited that such law was said to be\n\n‘facially neutral.’ On this note, the following was stated:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_243\">         “13. …We have never held that an\n         individual&#x27;s religious beliefs excuse him\n         from compliance with an otherwise\n         valid law prohibiting conduct that the\n         State is free to regulate.

As described succinctly by\n         Justice Frankfurter in Minersville School\n         Dist. Bd. of Ed. v. Gobitis, 310 U.S. 586,\n         594-595, <a href=\"/doc/105684163/\" id=\"a_581\">60</a> S.Ct. 1010, 1012-1013, 84\n         L.Ed. 1375 (1940): &quot;Conscientious\n         scruples have not, in the course of the\n         long struggle for religious toleration,\n         relieved the individual from obedience\n         to a general law not aimed at the\n         promotion or restriction of religious\n         beliefs.

Another question which the School Administration\n\n  and the State must answer in the present case is as to\n\n  what is more important to them: Education of a girl\n\n  child or Enforcement of a Dress Code! We have been\n\n  informed at the Bar by many of the Senior counsels\n\n  appearing for the Petitioners, that the unfortunate\n\n  fallout of the enforcement of hijab ban in schools in\n\n  Karnataka has been that some of the girl students have\n\n  not been able to appear in their Board examinations,\n\n  and many others were forced to seek transfer to other\n\n  schools, most likely madrasas, where they may not get\n\n  the same standard of education. This is for a girl child,\n\n  for whom it was never easy, in the first place, to reach\n\n  her school gate.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_245\">66.      One of the best sights in India today, is of a girl\n\n  child leaving for her school in the morning, with her\n\n  school bag on her back. She is our hope, our future. But\n\n  it is also a fact, that it is much more difficult for a girl\n\n  child to get education, as compared to her brother. In\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_318\">                          60</span>\n\f  villages     and   semi    urban    areas   in   India,   it   is\n\n  commonplace for a girl child to help her mother in her\n\n  daily chores of cleaning and washing, before she can\n\n  grab her school bag. The hurdles and hardships a girl\n\n  child undergoes in gaining education are many times\n\n  more than a male child. This case therefore has also to\n\n  be seen in the perspective of the challenges already\n\n  faced by a girl child in reaching her school. The question\n\n  this Court would therefore put before itself is also\n\n  whether we are making the life of a girl child any better\n\n  by denying her education, merely because she wears a\n\n  hijab!\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_246\">67.        All the Petitioners want is to wear a hijab! Is it too\n\n  much to ask in a democracy? How is it against public\n\n  order, morality or health? or even decency or against\n\n  any other provision of Part III of the Constitution. These\n\n  questions have not been sufficiently answered in the\n\n  Karnataka High Court Judgement. The State has not\n\n  given any plausible reasons either in the Government\n\n  Order dated 5 February 2022, or in the counter affidavit\n\n  before the High Court.

It is the trust the minorities have\n\n            reposed upon the majority.

He said, “…. it is not our intention to commit the\n\n            minorities to a               particular position in a hurry. If they\n\n            really have to come honestly to the conclusion that in\n\n            the changed conditions of this country, it is in the\n\n            interest of all to lay down real and genuine foundations\n\n            of a secular State, then nothing is better for the\n\n            minorities than to trust the good- sense and sense of\n\n            fairness of the majority, and to place confidence in\n\n            them. So also, it is for us who happened to be in a\n\n            majority to think about what the minorities feel, and\n\n            how we in their position would feel if we were treated in\n\n            the manner in which they are treated .36”\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_446\">        70.

The preamble to the Constitution secures to all its\n\n             citizens “LIBERTY of thought, expression, belief, faith\n\n             and worship.” It is the Preamble again which seeks to\n\n             promote among them all, “FRATERNITY assuring the\n42 <a href=\"/doc/91938676/\" id=\"a_586\">Para</a> 81 (supra)\n43 <a href=\"/doc/246741/\" id=\"a_587\">Article 51A(f)</a> of the Constitution of India\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_329\">                                                 68</span>\n\f            dignity of the individual and the unity and integrity of\n\n           the Nation.”\n           The Government Order dated 5 February, 2022, and the\n\n           restrictions on the wearing of hijab, also goes against\n\n           our constitutional value of fraternity and human dignity.\n\n           Liberty, equality, fraternity, the triptych of the French\n\n           Revolution is also a part of our Preamble. It is true that\n\n           whereas liberty and equality are well established,\n\n           properly understood, and recognized concepts in politics\n\n           and law, fraternity for some reasons has largely\n\n           remained incognito. The framers of our Constitution\n\n           though had a different vision. Fraternity had a different,\n\n           and in many ways a much larger meaning with the main\n\n           architect of our Constitution, Dr Ambedkar. In his own\n\n           words: “my social philosophy may be said to be\n\n           enshrined in these words: liberty, equality and fraternity.\n\n           Let no one, however, say that I have borrowed my\n\n           philosophy from the French Revolution. I have not. My\n\n           philosophy has roots in religion and not in political\n\n           science. I have derived them from my Master, the\n\n           Buddha44.”            Dr Ambedkar gave the highest place to\n44Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, Government of India, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar: Writings and\nSpeeches, 2020 (Vol XVII, Part III); Preface\nAccessed at https://www.mea.gov.in/Images/CPV/Volume17_Part_III.pdf\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_330\">                                                  69</span>\n\f           fraternity as it was the only real safeguard against the\n\n           denial of liberty or equality. “These principles of liberty,\n\n           equality and fraternity are not to be treated as separate\n\n           items in trinity. They form a union of trinity in the sense\n\n           that to diverse one from the other is to defeat the very\n\n           purpose of democracy. Liberty cannot be divorced from\n\n           equality; equality cannot be divorced from liberty. Nor\n\n           can liberty and equality be divorced from fraternity.\n\n           Without equality, liberty would produce a supremacy of\n\n           the few over the many. Equality without liberty would kill\n\n           individual initiative.                  Without fraternity liberty and\n\n           equality could not become a natural course of things. 45”</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_456\">        79.          Fraternity, which is our Constitutional value, would\n\n            therefore require us to be tolerant, and as some of the\n\n            learned        Counsels          would        argue        to    be,      reasonably\n\n            accommodating,                towards          the      belief      and         religious\n\n            practices of others.

Under our Constitutional scheme, wearing a hijab\n\n  should be simply a matter of Choice. It may or may not\n\n  be a matter of essential religious practice, but it still is,\n\n  a matter of conscience, belief, and expression. If she\n\n  wants to wear hijab, even inside her class room, she\n\n  cannot be stopped, if it is worn as a matter of her\n\n  choice, as it may be the only way her conservative\n\n  family will permit her to go to school, and in those\n\n  cases, her hijab is her ticket to education.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_458\">81.   The unfortunate fallout of the hijab restriction would\n\n  be that we would have denied education to a girl child.\n\n  A girl child for whom it is still not easy to reach her\n\n  school gate. This case here, therefore, has also to be\n\n  seen in the perspective of the challenges already faced\n\n  by a girl child in reaching her school. The question this\n\n  Court would put before itself is also whether we are\n\n  making the life of a girl child any better by denying her\n\n  education merely because she wears a hijab!\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_459\">82.
