While\n\nnarrating his excellence in the academic career as well as in service,\n\nthe petitioner contended that          during his tenure as Addl. DGP,\n\nIntelligence the then leaders of the opposition party blamed him, as\n\nhe is responsible for certain political events and made several\n\nstatements in Press, Public meetings and in Electronic media. The\n\npetitioner taken them in his stride, as such accusations are being\n\nmade routinely. Press clippings, video recordings and screen shots of\n\nsocial media postings are placed on record in support of his\n\ncontentions to prove the acrimonious statements made against him.\n\nOn the eve of general elections, they also represented to the Election\n\nCommission of India, against the petitioner, seeking his transfer\n\nalleging that he was working for the Government viz., political party\n\nin power. Though the petitioner has nothing to do with the election\n\nprocess, the Election Commission ordered his transfer. Accordingly,\n\nhe was transferred and posted as Director General, ACB on\n\n22.04.2019 and continued as such till the new political Government\n\ncame into power. As there was a change in the political Government,\n\non the very first day the new government was sworn i.e. on\n                                                                   MSM,J\n                                                           wp_13649_2020\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                  5</span>\n\n30.05.2019, he was transferred from the post of Director General,\n\nACB and asked to report to General Administration Department\n\n(GAD) for posting. Accordingly, he was relieved the very next day and\n\nreported to GAD. Thereafter, he was kept without posting and\n\nwithout payment of salary. Having waited for more than seven\n\nmonths, he made representations dated 06.01.2020 and 28.01.2020.\n\nBut, as a rebuttal to his representations, the State Government\n\nissued G.O.Ms.No.18, dated 08.02.2020 placing the petitioner under\n\nsuspension pending enquiry.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_4\">      The petitioner also explained relevant facts leading to his\n\nsuspension i.e. to combat left wing extremism and red sanders\n\nsmuggling, both of which had claimed many lives of police and forest\n\nforce, with a view to track their activities by use of surveillance\n\nequipment, it was thought that the Andhra Pradesh Police shall\n\nacquire such technology and hardware with the funds provided by\n\nthe Central Government for modernization of police force. Pursuant\n\nto the request made by the Addl. Director General of Police\n\n(Intelligence) dated 14.06.2017, the Director General of Police has\n\nconstituted a purchase committee and a technical committee for\n\nexamining   the   same   and   also   for   finalizing   the terms   and\n\nprocurement of the equipment. The petitioner was not a party to\n\nboth the committees. The tender process was entrusted to the State\n\nTrading Corporation of India, a Government of India enterprise.\n\nWhen global tenders were invited, the minimum cost of the\n\nequipment quoted by the tenderer had far exceeded the budget\n\nprovided for and hence, the meeting of the purchasing committee\n\nwas convened. The said meeting was called on 26.06.2018 and the\n\npetitioner attended the said meeting since Inspector General of Police\n                                                               MSM,J\n                                                       wp_13649_2020\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                 6</span>\n\ndeputed him as Inspector General of Police was out of station and as\n\nthe petitioner was holding additional charge of the said post. In the\n\nsaid meeting chaired by the Chairman of the Purchase Committee\n\nand attended by eight IPS officers, it was unanimously decided to\n\nscale down the specifications to suit the budget and to refloat the\n\ntender. Minutes of the meeting were recorded. Again, pursuant to the\n\nscaling down of tenders, tenders were floated by the State &#x27;Trading\n\nCorporation of India and purchase order dated 05.10.2018 was\n\nissued to the successful bidder by the State Trading Corporation. At\n\nthat stage, by proceedings dated 24.12.2018, the Director General of\n\nPolice had cancelled the purchase order issued by the State Trading\n\nCorporation for the reasons specified therein. Thus in the entire\n\nprocess, no financial loss was caused, except, the cost of engaging\n\nState Trading Corporation (STC) for tender process.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">      The speed with which, the order of suspension was passed\n\ndemonstrate more than that meets the eye. On 02.02.2020 (being\n\nSunday) respondent No.2, on his own, addressed a letter to Addl.\n\nDirector General (CID) to investigate and submit a report as regards\n\nthe procurement of equipment etc. On 03.02.2020, the ADG, CID\n\nentrusted the same to a Deputy Superintendent of Police though the\n\nDGP, ADGs and IG level officers are involved in the procurement\n\nprocess. The chosen and obligated Dy. Superintendent of Police\n\nsubmitted a report on 06.02.2020 implicated the petitioner as he\n\nviolated conduct rules. The accusation was that the successful\n\ntenderer who was issued a purchase order on 05.10.2018 had\n\nbusiness dealings with a company, of which his son is a Director. It\n\nis alleged that the participation of the petitioner in the process,\n\nconstitutes violation of conduct Rules. On 07.02.2020 respondent\n                                                                   MSM,J\n                                                           wp_13649_2020\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                    7</span>\n\nNo.2 forwarded the same to Government and on 08.02.2020 (being\n\nsecond Saturday) the order of suspension was passed, after being\n\napproved by the competent authority dealing with All India Service\n\nOfficers. The petitioner challenged the order of suspension before the\n\nCentral Administrative Tribunal, Hyderabad, which was dismissed\n\non 17.03.2020. The petitioner challenged the said order before this\n\nCourt by filing W.P.No.8185 of 2020 and by order dated 22.05.2020,\n\nthis Court set aside the order of the CAT, also quashed the order of\n\nsuspension and directed reinstatement of the petitioner with all\n\nbenefits.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">        The petitioner learnt through news papers, that the State\n\nGovernment had filed Special Leave Petition in the Supreme Court of\n\nIndia, but till date no notice was served on the petitioner.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">        The Anti Corruption Bureau, which was entrusted with further\n\nprobe    continued   its&#x27;   probe/enquiry   into   the   procurement   of\n\nequipment, role of the petitioner and his son. The petitioner also\n\nwelcomed the same. In the process of the enquiry/probe, his son was\n\nalso summoned and his statement was also recorded. At this stage,\n\nthe petitioner noticed that the enquiry had taken a curious turn. The\n\nACB authorities, with a view to win laurels from the ruling\n\ndispensation and who happened to be his junior officers in service\n\nand would be the beneficiaries, if the petitioner is made to suffer in\n\nservice, started enquiry into personal affairs. They misrepresented to\n\nthe bank authorities, as if they are probing his son and his company\n\naffairs and sought for bank account statements. Admittedly, there is\n\nno financial angle to the enquiry, that too against his son. The bank\n\nauthorities without asking for further details, had furnished the\n\nbank account statements. Based on the said bank account\n                                                                 MSM,J\n                                                         wp_13649_2020\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                   8</span>\n\nstatements, the ACB sent a questionnaire to his son seeking\n\nclarifications, as regards various unconnected transactions. His son\n\nsent a reply asking for the authority and clandestine manner of\n\nobtaining the documents. They kept silent without any reply, as they\n\nknew that they committed wanton wrongs. The ACB had also sent a\n\nnotice to the petitioner as to the source of money, which he gave to\n\nhis son&#x27;s company on his request and the petitioner gave a reply\n\ndisclosing the source of income. Further, on conclusion of the\n\ninvestigation, the ACB gave a notice to the petitioner for his response\n\nwith regard to his violation of conduct rules applicable to his service\n\nand the petitioner issued suitable reply to the said notice.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_8\">      Having concluded that the allegations made against the\n\npetitioner constitutes violation of the Conduct Rules, the ACB further\n\npursuing the probe, with a view to implicate the petitioner in a\n\ncriminal case and swoop on him and his son and arrest them. The\n\napprehension of the petitioner is further fortified by the fact that the\n\nofficers like respondent No.2, ADG (ACB) and ADG (CID) are hell bent\n\nto please the political bosses. A recent tweet by the Senior IAS officer\n\nand Advisor of the Government who worked in the CMs&#x27; Secretariat\n\nto the effect that &quot;IAS and IPS officers are working not in public\n\ninterest, but for those big wigs in the Government&quot; would certainly\n\nprove the fact that the police machinery is being used to achieve the\n\ngoals set by political establishment. The fact of police arresting\n\npersons even for social media postings against government policies\n\nand political bosses and arrest of the people at midnight, odd hours\n\netc., bring back the days of emergency. The petitioner believe the\n\nsame to be true that apart from the hatred towards him, as exhibited\n\nearlier and the later events such as order of suspension being\n                                                                    MSM,J\n                                                            wp_13649_2020\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                   9</span>\n\nquashed by the court and the findings of ACB that he violated only\n\nthe conduct rules etc. had upset the political establishment and it\n\nappears that a plan was hatched to somehow file a criminal case\n\nagainst the petitioner, arrest the petitioner and keep in judicial\n\ncustody for 48 hours, so that irrespective of the result of SLP in the\n\nSupreme Court, they would have a separate ground to keep the\n\npetitioner under suspension. The petitioner was not given any\n\nposting, leave alone respectable posting befitting to his rank,\n\nseniority and reputation. The petitioner being a public servant, it is\n\nhis duty to justify the posting given to him by working honestly,\n\ndiligently without fear or favour, which is not      acceptable to the\n\npolitical establishment, who command personal loyalties by the\n\nofficers.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_9\">       The petitioner believed that the police department under the\n\ncommand of respondent No.2 is working under duress and threat to\n\nact to the dictates and tunes of political establishment.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_10\">       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"501198\" id=\"span_6\">It is further contended that the personal liberty is always\n\ntreated as a prime right among the fundamental rights guaranteed\n\nby the Constitution of India. No person shall be deprived of personal\n\nliberty except by a manner established by law. Time and again\n\ndealing with the powers of the police to arrest, it was held by the\n\nApex Court, that no arrest can be made just because it is lawful for\n\nthe police officer to do so. The police officer must be able to justify\n\nthe arrest apart from his power to do so. But unfortunately by the\n\ntime, the arrestee is able to demonstrate that there is no justification\n\nfor arrest, the mischief is carried out. By that time, because of the\n\nelectronic and social media, incalculable harm is being done to the\n\nreputation of the arrestee. If arrestee happens to be public servant,\n                                                                 MSM,J\n                                                         wp_13649_2020\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                  10</span>\n\nthe automatic suspension for being in judicial custody springs in.\n\nThe Apex Court also held that the power of arrest cannot be resorted\n\nto as a routine in all cases, but it can only be resorted to in cases\n\nwhere the offence alleged is heinous in nature. Despite the clear\n\nguidelines issued by the Apex Court that the arrest must be avoided\n\nand can be resorted to only in extreme cases, it had become a\n\nroutine affair in practice, thereby violating the right of personal\n\nliberty of individual and harm to the reputation of the person. The\n\narrests are being effected in violation of the directions of the Apex\n\nCourt in &quot;<a href=\"/doc/501198/\" id=\"a_2\">D.K. Basu vs. State of West Bengal1</a>&quot;. Thus, the\n\npetitioner apprehending his arrest in the state of affairs narrated\n\nabove, the respondents are trying to tarnish his image and\n\nreputation being a public officer without any ground and to avoid\n\nloss of reputation and liberty. Hence, the petitioner approached this\n\nCourt invoking extraordinary jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_3\">Article 226</a> of the\n\nConstitution of India, requested to issue a direction as stated above.</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\">         Respondent Nos.1 and 2 filed common counter and one Kumar\n\nVishwajeet, Principal Secretary to Government, Home Department,\n\nA.P.

The misuse of official position and corruption angles are\n\ndefinitely required to be enquired into so as to initiate suitable action\n\neither under conduct rules or under the criminal law and the\n\npetitioner has no legally sustainable grounds to express his\n\napprehensions about the same and seek a protection even before\n\nputting the criminal law into motion.

In compliance\n\nof the said orders, the ADGP, CID submitted            an enquiry report\n\nto the DGP, Andhra         Pradesh      on 06.02.2020 and that enquiry\n\nreport was forwarded by the DGP, Andhra Pradesh to the Chief\n\nSecretary,    Government of Andhra         Pradesh    on 07.02.2020. On\n\n08.02.2020,     the     Chief   Secretary,       Government      of Andhra\n\nPradesh vide Government Memo No.I096510/SC.D/2020 dated\n\n08.02.2020 forwarded the aforesaid enquiry report to respondent\n\nNo.3 Respondent (DG, ACB) to conduct a detailed enquiry                  into\n\nthe allegations against the petitioner and to submit report to the\n\nGovernment for taking further action in the matter.

The enquiry conducted so far disclosed that\n\ndespite the fact that Sri Chetan Sai Krishna Aluru @ Sri Chetan\n\nKrishna,    son   of the   petitioner herein,   has been the Indian\n\nrepresentative/agent of M/s. RT Inflatables         Objects Limited/\n\nM/s.RT     LTA Systems Limited of Israel. The petitioner misused his\n\nposition as a civil servant in order to derive the benefit in favour of\n\nhis son (Mr.Chetan Sai     Krishna     Aluru @ Sri Chetan Krishna)\n\nthrough such procurement and he failed to declare the aforesaid\n\nprivate interest (that his son has been the Indian epresentative/\n\nagent of M/s.RT Inflatables) related to the public duty.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_21\">      It is further contended that that after submitting the bid by\n\nM/s RT Inflatable Objects Limited, Israel, the bid was allotted\n\nin their favour on 10.9.2018. The total cost of equipment of\n\nRs.25.50 crores was transferred to STCIL in October 2018 and\n\npurchase order was placed.       Only one member from purchase\n\ncommittee Sri B.Srinivasulu, IPS, IGP, SIB and one member from\n\nTechnical committee Sri Mahesh Chandra Laddha, IPS, IGP, had\n\nwitnessed the live demo of the Aerostat or DAV. But later, the said\n\npurchase order was scrapped because of irregularities observed\n\nduring the procurement process. With great difficulty, the AP Police\n\nDepartment able to get back the amount due from STCIL in this\n\nregard.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_22\">      It is further contended that after issuing the proceedings vide\n\nNo.2371H2/2017, dated 24.12.2018 by the Director General of\n                                                                       MSM,J\n                                                               wp_13649_2020\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                                     15</span>\n\nPolice of AP (respondent No.2) cancelling the purchase order, the\n\npetitioner has sent letter dated 28.03.2019 to the then               DGP   in\n\nresponse to the decision taken for cancellation of purchase order\n\nand   he   further requested to review          the   cancellation of the\n\npurchase order      or at least,     to reinitiate the    entire      process\n\nimmediately by the office of the DGP to urgently procure the\n\nrequired items mentioned in the cancelled purchase order after\n\nfollowing the due procedure as deemed fit. The petitioner herein, in\n\nhis official capacity, put his efforts to renew the cancellation of\n\npurchaser order in order to benefit        M/s RT Inflatable          Objects\n\nLimited,   Israel   where   his    son    was    acting   as    the    Indian\n\nRepresentative/Agent.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_23\">      It is further contended that the           petitioner misused his\n\nposition as civil servant in order to derive the benefit for his son\n\nthrough such procurement and the petitioner also failed to declare\n\nthe aforesaid private interest, while discharging public duty. Hence,\n\nthe contention of the petitioner that there is no financial angle to\n\nthe enquiry, that too against his son is not correct.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_24\">      It is further contended that the relief sought for by the\n\npetitioner cannot be granted at preliminary stage as there cannot\n\nbe a blanket order of not to arrest whatsoever in any other\n\nproceedings. Writ of mandamus on mere apprehension is not\n\nmaintainable since there is no violation of fundamental or statutory\n\nrights as contended by the petitioner. On several occasions Apex\n\ncourt held that the power under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_16\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of\n\nIndia has to be exercised cautiously. Finally, respondent No.3\n\nrequested to dismiss the petition.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_25\">                                                                <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"175579179\" id=\"span_20\">MSM,J\n                                                        wp_13649_2020\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">                                     16</span>\n\n          Sri B.Adinarayana Rao, learned Senior Counsel appearing on\n\nbehalf of Sri Madhava Rao Nalluri, learned counsel for the petitioner,\n\nmainly contended that in the guise of enquiry by ACB against the\n\npetitioner, the respondents are contemplating to arrest the petitioner\n\nthough no material is available only with a view to harass him, that\n\ntoo the petitioner worked as Additional DGP, Intelligence, which is\n\nalmost higher rank in the State and worked as intelligence chief of\n\nthe State. If any arrest is affected, it would cause serious prejudice\n\nagainst his career and it would amount to infringement of right\n\nguaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_17\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India.

Therefore, the enquiry pending before the\n\nauthorities concerned is fact finding enquiry or in the nature of\n\npreliminary enquiry and based on the said enquiry, the Government\n\nis not going arrest the petitioner except when criminal law is set into\n\nmotion against the petitioner in the event of preliminary enquiry\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">5</span>\n    (2016) 7 SCC 761\n                                                                   MSM,J\n                                                           wp_13649_2020\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                                     17</span>\n\ndisclosed   any   incriminating      material   against   the   petitioner,\n\nrequested to dismiss the petition.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_26\">      No doubt, the petitioner is worked as Additional DGP,\n\nIntelligence, but he was placed under suspension, despite setting\n\naside the order of suspension directing to reinstate the petitioner\n\nwith all consequential benefits by order of this Court in W.P.No.8185\n\nof 2020, setting aside the order passed by the CAT, on the ground\n\nthat Special Leave Petition is preferred before the Apex Court against\n\nthe order passed by this Court in W.P.No.8185 of 2020. However,\n\nthis Court is unconcerned with the action being taken by the State\n\nwith regard to his suspension and reinstatement as the jurisdiction\n\nof this Court is limited in the present writ petition.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_27\">      The petitioner also highlighted his excellence in his academic\n\ncareer and he discharged his duties as public servant at different\n\nplaces including Bosnia. But the same is not relevant for the purpose\n\nof deciding the injury to the reputation of the petitioner being a\n\npolice official in the highest rank in the State.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_28\">      Undoubtedly,     the petitioner     worked as Additional       DGP,\n\nIntelligence Departmnet, Andhra Pradesh, during the regime of Nara\n\nChandrababu Naidu, Ex-chief Minister of state of Andhra Pradesh;\n\nthe petitioner has direct contract with the then Chief Minister as\n\nalleged in the affidavit filed along with the petition. Normally, the\n\nChief of Intelligence Department would brief the Chief Minister and\n\nother Ministers, with whom he has direct contact as to what is and\n\nwhat was going on in the State, and sometimes, he may carry some\n\ninformation about the political rivals also. Certainly, that would\n\ncause displeasure to the opposite political parties in the State. When\n\na political party, which was in opposition during the regime of this\n                                                                      MSM,J\n                                                              wp_13649_2020\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">                                    18</span>\n\npetitioner, they make take advantage of their power when they came\n\ninto power and start investigation etc.          It appears that this is one\n\nsuch incident since an allegation was made against him during\n\nquinquennial    elections   for   the    State    Assembly    and   he    was\n\ntransferred by the Election Commission of India from the office of\n\nIntelligence Chief of the State. Of course, that was challenged, but\n\nthe State failed to succeed in the attempt at that time before this\n\nCourt.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_29\">      The main contention of the petitioner is that the present\n\npolitical party in power, which was in opposition during the regime of\n\nthe petitioner, wanted to take revenge against him and foisted this\n\ncase, but that may not be a ground to grant relief in the present\n\npetition. However, the participation of the petitioner in the process of\n\nprocurement of security equipment is not in dispute. However, the\n\npurchase order was cancelled by the Government itself. He also did\n\nnot deny the business being carried on by his son and he is also\n\nfacing enquiry by the ACB official. The main endeavour of the\n\npetitioner is that no financial loss was caused on account of his\n\nparticipation in the process of procurement, except to the extent of\n\ntender process fee. Therefore, at best, the participation of the\n\npetitioner in the process of procurement without disclosing his\n\npersonal interest of his family members may amount to misconduct\n\nand not criminal misconduct prima facie. In fact, in view of the\n\ndirection issued by the State, Deputy Director, CIU, ACB, A.P.,\n\nVijayawada     issued   notice     C.No.29/RE-CIU-ACB/2020,              dated\n\n19.06.2020 to the petitioner, and explanation was called for from the\n\npetitioner within 10 days from the date of said notice, wherein it is\n\nstated as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">                                                                   MSM,J\n                                                           wp_13649_2020\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">                                    19</span>\n\n      &quot;Thus the enquiry conducted so far proved that you\n  have violated the following Rules of All India Services\n  (Conduct) Rules, 1968 as amended from time to time.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">      3.

The underlying\n  message in all these provisions is the acknowledgment that human rights are\n  individual and have a definite linkage to human development, both sharing\n  common vision and with a common purpose. Respect for human rights is the\n  root for human development and realisation of full potential of each\n  individual, which in turn leads to the augmentation of human resources with\n  progress of the nation. Empowerment of the people through human\n  development is the aim of human rights.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">      In international human rights law, equality is founded upon two\n  complementary principles: non-discrimination and reasonable differentiation.\n  The principle of non-discrimination seeks to ensure that all persons can\n  equally enjoy and exercise all their rights and freedoms. Discrimination\n  occurs due to arbitrary denial of opportunities for equal participation. For\n  example, when public facilities and services are set on standards out of the\n  reach of persons with disabilities, it leads to exclusion and denial of rights.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_38\">                                                                                 MSM,J\n                                                                         wp_13649_2020\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_96\">                                             34</span>\n      Equality not only implies preventing discrimination (example, the protection\n      of   individuals   against   unfavourable   treatment    by   introducing   anti-\n      discrimination laws), but goes beyond in remedying discrimination against\n      groups suffering systematic discrimination in society. In concrete terms, it\n      means embracing the notion of positive rights, affirmative action and\n      reasonable accommodation. The move from the patronising and paternalistic\n      approach to persons with disabilities represented by the medical model to\n      viewing them as members of the community with equal rights has also been\n      reflected in the evolution of international standards relating specifically to\n      disabilities, as well as in moves to place the rights of persons with disabilities\n      within the category of universal human rights.
