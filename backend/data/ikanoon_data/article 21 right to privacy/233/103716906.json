The\n       Indian legal genius of old has made a healthy\n       contribution to the world treasury of criminology.\n       The drawback of our criminal process is that\n       often they are built on the bricks of\n       impressionist opinions and dated values,\n       ignoring      empirical    studies   and     deeper\n       researches....India, like every other country, has\n       its own crime complex and dilemma of punishment.\n       Solutions to tangled social issues do not come like\n       the crack of dawn but are the product of research\n       and study, oriented on the founding faiths of society\n       and driving towards that transformation which is\n       the goal of free India...&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_2\">       All these petitions involving similar questions of law &amp;\n\nfacts essentially pertain to &#x27;Rowdy Sheeting&#x27; and &#x27;History\n\nSheeting&#x27;.

To\n\ncontextualise this discussion, it would be profitable to note the\n\nfollowing words of TOM LLOYD28 from the University of\n\nEdinburgh:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">       &quot;In their attempts to constitute a particular kind of\n       authority over bandits in early colonial India,\n       British Administrators of the East India Company\n       were moved to legislate against what they\n       perceived as certain extraordinary criminal groups,\n       defined by the alleged secrecy of their operations\n       and the fundamental irrationality of their cause,\n       which        was      figured      as       merciless\n       depredation...&#x27;Thug&#x27; was the name given to a figure\n       located beyond the pale of &#x27;civil&#x27; society, and held\n       to be a member of a community of &#x27;irreclaimable&#x27;\n       predators upon it, who could not be socialised into\n       conventional law...Through policing, this defining\n       and controlling, they characterized (and indeed\n       caricatured) not only those individuals who would\n       henceforth be considered non-subjects to which\n       ordinary procedures of British administration\n       would not apply - dacoits and thugs...&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">(ii)   In light of the above, the identification of categories of\n\n&#x27;thugs&#x27;   paved   the   way   for    innovative   and   extra-judicial\n\nmechanisms for dealing with the rowdy elements. The &#x27;Anti\n\nThuggee Campaign&#x27; provided to Governor General Bentinck&#x27;s\n\nadministration by Captain William Sleeman sought to deal with\n\nthe systematic and lurking menace that until now escaped\n\njustice by exploiting the margins of Civil and State authority.\n\nThough the campaign was pursued for colonial security, it was\n\nundertaken with overtones of &#x27;duty&#x27; for the good of hapless\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">                                     29</span>\n\nsociety. An instance of such an approach is evident from\n\njudicial reforms introduced by Warren Hastings in 1772\n\nwhereby <a href=\"/doc/448465/\" id=\"a_67\">Article 35</a> of the Regulating Act provided that bandits\n\nwould be executed and their families would become &#x27;slaves of\n\nthe     state&#x27;.29   However,   much      of   this   was    not   put    to\n\nimplementation. Hastings had said30:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">        &quot;...the dacoits of Bengal are not, like the robbers in\n        England, individuals driven to such desperate\n        course by sudden want: they are robbers by\n        profession, and even by birth; they are formed into\n        regular communities, and their families subsist by\n        the spoils which they bring home to them: they are\n        all, therefore, alike, criminal wretches, who have\n        placed themselves in a state of declared war with\n        our Government, and are therefore wholly excluded\n        from any benefit of its laws...&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_15\">A Dacoit was not simply set outside the law, but rather\n\nabandoned by it.

The only discernable elements of a &#x27;rowdy sheeter&#x27; are\n\nprovided under Order 1059(1) &amp; (2) which reads as under:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">      &quot;1059 (1) a rowdy may be defined as a goonda\n      and includes a hooligan, tough, vagabond, or any\n      other person who is dangerous to the public peace\n      and tranquillity.(2) The main forms of rowdyism\n      are:-(a) passing indecent remarks at women and\n      Schools and College Girls; (b) Intimidation of law\n      abiding people by acts of violence or by show of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">                                 33</span>\n\n       force or by abusive language; (c) Forcible collection\n       of subscription; (d) Taking sides in petty quarrels\n       between landlords and tenants or between co-\n       tenants and threatening people of the opposite\n       party; (e) Disorderly conduct; (f) Rioting; (g)\n       Snatching and Committing robbery.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_25\">Chapter XXI, Part VI, of the Police Manual provides for &#x27;History\n\nSheets&#x27; and &#x27;Register of Rowdies&#x27;; certain provisions are made\n\ncommon to both. Illustratively, Order 1057 states that History\n\nSheets can only be opened for a period of two years and\n\nextension can take place upon the order of Superior Police\n\nofficer. Clause (3) of 1057 applies the same to &#x27;rowdy sheets&#x27; as\n\nwell. Further, definition of a rowdy implies any person\n\ndangerous to public peace &amp; tranquillity. For example, eve\n\nteasers, people who collected money, persons indulging in\n\nrioting, goondas, bootleggers, and land grabbers would all come\n\nunder the definition of &#x27;rowdy&#x27;. To keep a watch on such\n\npersons a &#x27;register of rowdies&#x27; is maintained in every Police\n\nStation. For entering of names in the rowdy register order of the\n\nSuperintendent     of   Police/Sub   Divisional   Police   Office   is\n\nrequired.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_27\">(vi)   In every Police Station, as a matter of statutory policy\n\n&#x27;Register of Rowdies&#x27; has to be maintained in three parts, viz,\n\nPart A containing names of persons who are residing in the\n\njurisdictional limits of the Police Station or Locals who are\n\nconfirmed rowdies; Part B containing names of confirmed\n\nrowdies whose activities occur in a Police Station but are\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">                                     34</span>\n\nresident in the jurisdiction of other Police Stations or non -\n\nlocals who are confirmed rowdies; Part C containing names of\n\nnovices or persons who have started coming to notice or are\n\nbudding rowdies.

Learned AGA\n\njustifies this measure on the ground of necessity and in public\n\ninterest. Viewed from PUTTASWAMY jurisprudence, what is\n\nargued on behalf of the citizens and what is contended on\n\nbehalf of the State appear to be the two extremes. Petitioners\n\nassert that the institution of Rowdy Sheeting should have no\n\nplace in a &#x27;liberty oriented&#x27; regime whereas, the State counters\n\nthe same. Mikhail Bakunin (1814 - 1876) had said that the\n\nState is formed on the premise that men are wicked and society\n\nis organized on the assumption that they are virtuous. Keeping\n\nthis in mind, a golden balance needs to be struck between the\n\ntwo opposing claims so that the same shall serve the cause of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_63\">                                    44</span>\n\nboth the individual interest and the community interest. After\n\nall, our constitution does not guarantee rights and liberties in\n\nabsolute terms. It has been a settled position of law that the\n\nprivate interest to an extent has to yield to the public welfare. In\n\nany organised society, an individual barters away some of his\n\nrights &amp; liberties as a &#x27;fair-price&#x27; for being a member of the\n\ncommunity. Therefore, the argument that the institutionalized\n\nRowdy        Register/History    Sheeting     should     be    abruptly\n\ndiscontinued by the stroke of a pen cannot be acceded to.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_57\">Ordinarily, what measures are to be put in place in for\n\nregulating the lives of people, is a matter pertaining to the\n\ndomain of Executive Wisdom. Our system enjoins a duty that\n\nevery organ of the State should show due deference to the\n\ndecisions of co-ordinate organs. Arguably, this too is a &#x27;basic\n\nfeature&#x27; of the Constitution. Courts cannot run a race of\n\nopinions with the Executive.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_58\">(ii)   As already mentioned above, Rowdy/History Sheeting as\n\nan institutionalized State mechanism to prevent social turmoil\n\nand to control crimes has been there since centuries in several\n\ncivilized jurisdictions. Its forms &amp; nomenclatures may vary but\n\nits obtainment cannot be much disputed. This fact itself proves\n\nits utility and consequent justification for continuance. Social\n\nscientists     say   that   a   social   institution   that   does   not\n\nsubstantially enure to the benefit of community at large would\n\nwither away, sooner or later. The enormous utilitarian value of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_64\">                                     45</span>\n\nthis police practice justifies the same being institutionalized by\n\nthe     State,    some     amount    of   evil     associated   with   it,\n\nnotwithstanding. At the same time, learned Amicus Curiae&#x27;s\n\nreliance on an article by CHARLES WAREN &amp; LUIS D.\n\nBRADEIS47, written more than a century ago, is also justified. A\n\nrelevant portion of the said article has been profitably\n\nreproduced below:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">        &quot;...once a civilization has made a distinction\n        between the &#x27;outer&#x27; and the &#x27;inner&#x27; man...it\n        becomes impossible to avoid the idea of privacy by\n        whatever name it may be called - the idea of a\n        &#x27;private space in which man may become and\n        remain himself&#x27;... &quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_59\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"80997184\" id=\"span_65\">(iii)   The above having been said, one has to broadly advert to\n\nthe likely consequences of Rowdy/History Sheeting: Senior\n\nAdvocates, Mr. Sandesh Chouta &amp; Mr. Prasanna Kumar rightly\n\nsubmitted        that    the   registration   of    an   individual    in\n\nRowdy/History Sheets results into curtailment of his rights &amp;\n\nliberties, or at least it has such a potential. Registration\n\nassumes relevance in matters relating to police surveillance,\n\nexternment orders, preventive detention, parading of shady\n\ncharacters, requisition for weapon deposit, verification of\n\ncredentials for private &amp; public employment, furnishing of\n\ninputs to lending agencies &amp; banks, discreet information for\n\nmarriage &amp; business alliances.

It is a truism, often forgotten in the hidden\n      vendetta in human bosoms, that barbarity breeds\n      barbarity, and injury recoils as injury, so that if\n      hearing the mentally or morally maimed or\n      malformed man (found guilty) is the goal,\n      awakening the inner being, more than torturing\n      through exterior compulsions, holds out better\n      curative hopes.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_67\">(vii) In light of the discussion in the preceding paragraphs it\n\ncan be safely stated that: the implications of name of an\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_75\">                                50</span>\n\nindividual being entered, and indefinitely continued in the\n\n&#x27;Register of Rowdies&#x27; are far reaching. There are discernible\n\nconsequences    adverse   to   the   interest   of   the   individual\n\nconcerned who may not be an accused. Therefore, there has to\n\nbe a due procedure put in place for making or continuing\n\nentries in the rowdy register/history sheets. There also has to\n\nbe evolved a proper Grievance Redressal Mechanism against a\n\nwrongful registration of names &amp; their continuation, regardless\n\nof the request of the aggrieved for deletion. The existing\n\nprovisions of the Manual as interpreted by the Courts hitherto\n\nsupposedly prove inadequate in the light of PUTTASWAMY\n\njurisprudence which has expanded the content &amp; contours of\n\nprivacy and autonomy of individuals.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_68\">\nX.   HISTORY SHEETING OF INDIVIDUALS LONG AFTER\n\nACQUITTAL:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">     One has to keep in mind that Rowdy Register and History\n\nSheets have some difference in the light of text of the provisions\n\nof the Manual. Ordinarily, for making an entry in the history\n\nsheet an individual should have undergone some criminal\n\nproceedings that may or may not have ended in conviction.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">However, the rowdy sheet stands on a different footing in the\n\nsense that the person whose name figures therein may be a\n\n&#x27;clean slater&#x27;. Punishment, in criminal jurisprudence, purges\n\nthe guilt, is true. However, it is not that soon after completing\n\nthe prison term, one becomes a saint or a savant. Both, legal,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_76\">                                    51</span>\n\nsocial stigma or some kind of disability continues for some\n\nperiod even after one completes his imprisonment and comes\n\nout from the gaol. Several legislations, more particularly in the\n\nrealm of election law, service law and the like encumber rights\n\nof convicts even after they have served the sentence and paid\n\nthe fine. On the same analogy, it can be argued that even after a\n\nperson successfully comes out with an acquitted he may risk\n\nhis name being entered or continued in the history sheets, if\n\ncogent grounds therefore do continue. Merely because a person\n\nis acquitted of the criminal charge or that the criminal\n\nproceedings against him are quashed and since then long time\n\nhas lapsed, he cannot as a matter of right seek deletion of his\n\nname from the history sheet on that ground per se. Something\n\nmore is required. After all, rowdy sheeting &amp; history sheeting\n\nare not the punitive measures but preventive techniques of\n\npossible disruption of societal peace. In any event, a History\n\nSheeter can be shifted to the register of rowdies, if there are\n\ncogent reasons for that. However, all these are matters left to\n\nthe regulated police discretion.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">XI.   DUE PROCESS IN ROWDY SHEETING:\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"656741\" id=\"span_77\">(i)   Indisputably, basic human rights are universal; however,\n\ntheir regulation is also a constitutional reality. Restrictions and\n\nregulations on Part III rights, is the trade-off which persons\n\nbear for being members of a civilized community. When law\n\nprovides for prevention detention, it cannot be gainfully argued\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_78\">                                 52</span>\n\nthat the rules providing for rowdy registration &amp; history\n\nsheeting   are   unconstitutional.   The   rights   constitutionally\n\nguaranteed compete with the power constitutionally vested in\n\nthe State to restrict them.      As already mentioned above, a\n\ngolden balance needs to be a struck between these competing\n\ninterests. While deliberating the grant of bail, the Apex Court in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/656741/\" id=\"a_98\">GUDIKANTI NARASIMHULU vs. PUBLIC PROSECUTOR, HIGH</a>\n\nCOURT OF ANDHRA PRADESH52 observed:</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">      &quot;...After all, personal liberty of an accused or\n      convict is fundamental, suffering lawful eclipse\n      only in terms of &#x27;procedure established by law&#x27;. The\n      last four words of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_99\">Art. 21</a> are the life of that human\n      right. The doctrine of Police Power, constitutionally\n      validates punitive processes for the maintenance of\n      public order, security of the State, national integrity\n      and the interest of the public generally. Even so,\n      having regard to the solemn issue involved,\n      deprivation of personal freedom, ephemeral or\n      enduring, must be founded on the most serious\n      considerations relevant to the welfare objectives of\n      society, specified in the Constitution...&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_69\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1741605\" id=\"span_79\">Thus, the deprivation of liberty of an individual is a matter of\n\ngrave concern and permissible only when the law authorizing it\n\nis reasonable, even-handed and geared to              the goals of\n\ncommunity good and necessity spelt out in the constitutional\n\nguarantees. Procedural due process rests on the foundations of\n\nthe &#x27;just, fair &amp; reasonable&#x27; clause, ensuring that the substance\n\nof the right is not eroded by mere dictates of the black letter of\n\nlaw.

As Justice Frankfurter said, &quot;due\n         process&quot; is not a technical conception with a fixed\n         content unrelated to time, place and circumstances\n         See Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee v.\n         McGrath 341 U.<a href=\"/doc/98653383/\" id=\"a_101\">S. 123</a>...&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_72\">(ii)    On similar lines, &#x27;compelling State interest&#x27; avails as a\n\nground for restricting personal liberty.

From the United States\n         where the terminology of &#x27;compelling state interest&#x27;\n         originated, a strict standard of scrutiny comprises\n         two things- a &#x27;compelling state interest&#x27; and a\n         requirement of &#x27;narrow tailoring&#x27; (narrow tailoring\n         means that the law must be narrowly framed to\n         achieve the objective). As a term, compelling state\n         interest does not have definite contours in the US.\n         Hence, it is critical that this standard be adopted\n         with some clarity as to when and in what types of\n         privacy claims it is to be used...&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_73\">Notably, &#x27;procedural due process&#x27; is no longer a &#x27;formalistic\n\nrequirement&#x27; but rather signifies the content of the procedure\n\nand its quality which must be fair, just and reasonable.\n\nJurisprudentially, it must be observed that the foundational\n\nblocks of &#x27;substantive due process&#x27; correspond to inalienable\n\nvalues of a social order, whence fundamental natural liberties\n\ntoo     are   derived.

In other words, the\n         requirement of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_104\">Article 21</a> is not fulfilled only by the\n         enactment of fair and reasonable procedure under\n         the law and a law which does so may yet be\n         susceptible to challenge on the ground that its\n         content does not accord with the requirements of a\n         valid law...&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_75\">The above discussion highlights that though the determination\n\nof substantive content is left to the wisdom of the legislature,\n\njudicial inquiry is founded upon the realm of processes that\n\nbecome &#x27;due&#x27; when the State authorities in their anxiousness to\n\n\n53   Ronald Dworkin, Taking Rights Seriously, Duckworth (1977)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_82\">                                 55</span>\n\nprotect the public interest may abridge liberty of persons in an\n\narbitrary, unreasonable &amp; unjust manner.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_76\">(iv)   Though the institution of &#x27;rowdy sheeting&#x27; is evolved by\n\nnecessity, the due process clause needs to embedded in the\n\nentire exercise. In K.S. PUTTASWAMY at paragraph 165 it is\n\nobserved:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_42\">       &quot;...In his celebrated dissent, Justice Fazl Ali\n       pointed out that the phrase &#x27;procedure established\n       by law&#x27; was borrowed from the Japanese\n       Constitution (which was drafted under American\n       influence at the end of the Second World War) and\n       hence the expression means &#x27;procedural due\n       process&#x27;. In Justice Fazl Ali&#x27;s view the deprivation\n       of life and personal liberty under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_105\">Article 21</a>, had to\n       be preceded by (i) a notice; (ii) an opportunity of\n       being heard; (iii) adjudication by an impartial\n       tribunal; and (iv) an orderly course of procedure...&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_77\">The marked areas of &#x27;procedural due process&#x27; as mentioned\n\nabove provides the broad guidelines for identifying areas and\n\nforms of processes that accrue to the individual due to his name\n\nbeing registered in the Rowdy sheet/History sheet. It may be\n\nsaid that while the State has a legitimate interest in the\n\nprotection of its citizenry, there is also a duty resting on its\n\nshoulders for protecting the individuals as well. In matters of\n\nhistory   sheeting   and   rowdy     sheeting,   because   of   their\n\nimplications, the Police should critically examine &amp; adjust the\n\nboundaries between the societal interest and liberties of the\n\nindividual concerned. Therefore, arguably, there is a need for a\n\ncomprehensive legislation concerning the subject matter post\n\nPUTTASWAMY. Till that is done, the commoners cannot be\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_83\">                                   56</span>\n\nasked to put up with the legal regime now obtaining,\n\nunsatisfactorily.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_78\">        In the above circumstances, all these Writ Petitions are\n\ndisposed     off    prescribing   the   following   guidelines   for\n\nsupplementing the existing position of law relating to Rowdy\n\nSheeting &amp; History Sheeting:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_43\">         GUIDELINES FOR ROWDY/HISTORY SHEETING:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_44\">  i.     Before entering the name of an individual to the Register\n         of Rowdies, the jurisdictional police shall collect and\n         collate the material information concerning him and\n         frame the proposal for registration on that basis.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_45\">  ii.    A brief proposal notice shall be sent to the individual\n         concerned in a sealed cover with an option to submit his\n         representation within two weeks as to why his name\n         should not be registered as a rowdy. However, there is no\n         need to afford a personal hearing. In exceptional cases\n         notice may be dispensed with for reasons to be recorded\n         in the Register of Rowdies.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_46\"> iii.    In terms of Clause (5), Order 1059 of the Manual, the\n         Superintendent of Police or the Sub - Divisional Police\n         Officer shall not accord approval for entering the name of\n         individual concerned to the Register of Rowdies without\n         calling for records and objectively considering the same.\n         He shall briefly record his reasons for according the\n         approval and mark a copy thereof to the individual\n         forthwith, with a mention that he may petition the Police\n         Complaints Authority, against the same.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_47\"> iv.     The jurisdictional Police shall compulsorily once in two\n         years, undertake a periodic review of entries in the\n         Register of Rowdies suo motu, as provided under Clause\n         (2), Order 1057 of the Manual. However, it is open to the\n         aggrieved, to make a representation at any time after one\n         year of registration, seeking deletion of name from the\n         Rowdy Register on the basis of changed circumstances\n         such as rectitude, good conduct, social/community\n         service, etc.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_84\">                                  57</span>\n\n  v.    The representation for review shall be considered by the\n        jurisdictional Police at the initial level within a period of\n        30 days, during which necessary inputs may be obtained\n        through the available sources as to merits of the claim.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_79\">        The recommendation shall be sent to the jurisdictional\n        Superintendent of Police or the Sub - Divisional Police\n        Officer, within 15 days along with the representation &amp;\n        the material collected thereon. Such recommendation\n        along with the result of consideration of the\n        representation shall be communicated to the individual\n        concerned within next 15 days.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_80\"> vi.    Any individual aggrieved by the rejection of his\n        representation or continuation of his name in the\n        Register may petition to the Police Complaints Authority\n        ordinarily within 30 days. However, no personal hearing\n        shall avail. The petition shall be disposed off by recording\n        reasons within an outer limit of 60 days, after\n        considering the material on record or the fresh inputs\n        that may be requisitioned, by the authority.\n\nvii.    The entire process of Rowdy/History Sheeting from the\n        stage of issuance of proposal notice as specified above,\n        up to the issuance of the orders on the petition if any to\n        the Police Complaints Authority, shall be done only in a\n        sealed cover procedure and that nothing therein shall be\n        disclosed nor made available to anyone, except to the\n        aggrieved, nor any Right To Information (RTI) application\n        shall be entertained in this regard.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_81\">viii.   The violation of these guidelines shall constitute a major\n        misconduct and an adverse entry on proof thereof shall\n        be made by the Disciplinary Authority in the Service\n        Register of the erring official after hearing him and a\n        copy thereof shall be marked to the victim of Rowdy\n        Register/History Sheet, without brooking any delay.\n\n ix.    Whatever guidelines herein above laid down shall be\n        applicable to the case of History Sheeters as well, mutatis\n        mutandis and subject to the provisions of Karnataka\n        Police Manual, 1965.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_85\">                                 58</span><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_82\">\n\n        This court places on record its deep appreciation for the\n\nassistance rendered by Amicus Curiae, Mr. Sridhar Prabhu,\n\nSenior Advocates, Mr. Sandesh Chouta, Mr. Prasanna Kumar,\n\nand AGA Mr. Vinod Kumar.
