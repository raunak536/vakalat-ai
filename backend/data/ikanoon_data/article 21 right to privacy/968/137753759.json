The Writ Petition\n\n\n1         The petitioner, Sukanya Shantha, a journalist, wrote an article “From\n\nSegregation to Labour, Manu’s Caste Law Governs the Indian Prison System”, which\n\nwas published on 10 December 2020. The article highlighted caste-based\n\ndiscrimination in the prisons in the country. The petitioner has sought directions for\n\nrepeal of the offending provisions in State prison manuals. By an order dated 10 July\n\n2024, judgment was reserved. We have heard a broad diversity of viewpoints from\n\nacross India. Besides counsel for the petitioner and the intervenor, the Additional\n\nSolicitor General (ASG) of India appeared for the Union of India. The States of\n\nJharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Maharashtra, Orissa, Karnataka, Andhra\n\nPradesh, and Tamil Nadu appeared through counsel.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_2\">\n\n\n    II.   Submissions\n\n\n2         Dr. S. Muralidhar, Senior Advocate, appearing for the petitioner highlighted the\n\nissue of caste-based discrimination in the prisons in India. It was argued that various\n\nState prison manuals sanction blatantly unconstitutional practices, which are violative\n\nof <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_6\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_7\">, 15</a><a href=\"/doc/1987997/\" id=\"a_8\">, 17</a><a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_9\">, 21</a>, and <a href=\"/doc/1071750/\" id=\"a_10\">23</a> of the Constitution of India. Ms. Disha Wadekar\n\nreferred to a chart of provisions from different State prison manuals/rules to highlight\n\nvarious forms of discrimination in the prisons. She highlighted that caste-based\n\ndiscrimination continues to persist in the prisons in the country with respect to: (i) The\n\ndivision of manual labour; (ii) Segregation of barracks; and (iii) Provisions that\n\ndiscriminate against prisoners belonging to Denotified tribes and “habitual offenders”.\n\nShe further argued that the Model Prison Manual, 2016 does not address the\n\nimpugned provisions related to caste discrimination inside prisons other than the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                                                                        4</span>\n\f                                                                                PART II\n\n\ndiscrimination in kitchens, and that it is not “model” when it comes to addressing caste\n\ndiscrimination. In the written submissions, the petitioner’s side has further submitted\n\nthat the Home Departments of the Respondent States may also be directed to clarify\n\nthe definition of “Habitual Offenders” in their respective prison manuals so as to\n\nprevent its misuse against the denotified tribes in prisons.\n\n\n3      Ms. Aishwarya Bhati, Learned ASG, submitted a written note arguing that the\n\nMinistry of Home Affairs prepared the Model Prison Manual for the Superintendence\n\nand Management of Prisons in India, 2003 and The Model Prison Manual, 2016, and\n\ncirculated it to all States and Union Territories (UTs) in May 2016 explicitly prohibiting\n\ncaste and religion based discrimination practices. She also referred to the Advisory\n\ndated 26 February 2024 issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs, through the Deputy\n\nSecretary (PR &amp; ATC) to the Principal Secretary (Home/Jails) of all states and UTs and\n\nthe DG/IG Prisons of all States and UTs to ensure that the State Prison Manual/<a href=\"/doc/626516/\" id=\"a_11\">Prison\n\nAct</a> should not contain any discriminatory provisions. She further argued that “prisons,\n\nreformatories, Borstal institutions and other institutions of a like nature, and persons\n\ndetained therein” as a subject fall under the domain of the States under Entry 4, List II\n\nof the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_3\">\n4      Ms. Ashtha Sharma, counsel for the State of West Bengal, stated that the\n\ndiscrimination on the basis of caste/creed/ religion as envisaged in the provisions of\n\nWest Bengal Jail Code Rules, 1967 (Rules No. 741, 793, 860 and 1117) are not in\n\nforce/ practice within the Correctional Homes of West Bengal since long, and that a\n\nproposal for deletion/alteration/ amendment of the four Rules has been already sent\n\nto the appropriate authority. Mr. Anuj Saxena, counsel for the intervenor, has prayed\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                                                                        5</span>\n\f                                                                                                     PART III\n\n\nfor deletion of “caste” column and any references to caste in undertrial and/or convicts’\n\nprisoners’ registers.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">\n</p><pre id=\"pre_2\"> III.      Constitutional Interpretation\n\n\n5          As we deal with the present petition, we must refer to the values of the\n\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_5\">Constitution and the interpretation we must adopt. After all, the impugned provisions\n\nof the various prison manuals, highlighted in this petition, demonstrate that the values\n\nof the Constitution are at stake.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_6\">\n6          The Constitution reflects the vision of its founders to give India a collective\n\nfuture based on the values of liberty, equality, and fraternity. The Constitution\n\nmandates a more just and inclusive society, where every citizen has the opportunity\n\nto thrive. It envisages that the values embedded in its provisions are not just\n\naspirations but lived realities. Any interpretation of the Constitution must be reflective\n\nof the blueprint laid down by its founders. The Constitution is – as Granville Austin put\n\nit— a “social document” and a “modernizing force”, with its provisions embodying\n\n“humanitarian sentiments”. 1\n\n\n7          The interpretation of the Constitution is not static. It has evolved with time to\n\ngive recognition to a broader spectrum of rights to the citizens, as well as to impose\n\nadditional safeguards against excesses of the State or even private entities, as the\n\ncase may be. Over the last seventy-five years, the Supreme Court has recognized\n\nnew rights such as the right to education, 2 the right to privacy, 3 and the right against\n\nthe adverse impact of climate change, 4 among others. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1775396\" id=\"span_12\">These rights, though not\n\n\n1 Granville Austin, The Indian Constitution: Cornerstone of a Nation, Oxford University Press (1999), at pages 50,\n\nxii-xiii\n2 <a href=\"/doc/1775396/\" id=\"a_12\">Unni Krishnan v.

The Constitution\n\nmust serve as a robust framework for safeguarding the rights of citizens and\n\nmaintaining the delicate balance between authority and individual freedom.\n\n\n8       The Constitution recognizes the dignity and individual autonomy inherent in all\n\ncitizens and their right to life and personal liberty. Liberty and autonomy advance the\n\ncause of human dignity. 5 Individual autonomy is the ability to make decisions on\n\nmatters that impact one’s life. 6 When individuals are granted the freedom to make\n\nchoices about their own lives, they are empowered to take control of their destinies,\n\nand express their identities, in the “pursuit of happiness” 7 without undue interference.\n\nThis freedom fosters a sense of self-worth and respect, thereby recognizing individual\n\ndignity. By safeguarding these principles, we ensure that the intrinsic worth of every\n\nhuman being is recognized and upheld. The right to life cannot be restricted except\n\nthrough a law which is “substantively and procedurally fair, just and reasonable”. 8\n\n\n9       Our interpretation of the Constitution must fill the silences in its text. The framers\n\nof the Constitution could not have anticipated every situation that might arise in the\n\nfuture. They also intentionally left certain decisions to the discretion of future\n\ngenerations. However, the choices we make today must align with the broader\n\nconstitutional framework and values. In filling the gaps, whenever they arise, our\n\ninterpretation must enhance the foundational values of the Constitution such as\n\nequality, dignity, liberty, federalism and institutional accountability.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"184449972\" id=\"span_15\">Our interpretation\n\nmust adhere to the postulate that “civil and political rights and socio-economic rights\n\n\n5 <a href=\"/doc/184449972/\" id=\"a_14\">Common Cause v.

Courts are neutral\n\ninstitutions, whose primary function is to apply the law fairly and consistently.\n\nTransparency in processes also enhances public confidence in the system. 11 In their\n\nrole as neutral institutions, courts also act as a check on the other branches of\n\ngovernment, ensuring that their actions conform to constitutional and legal standards.\n\n\n11       The Constitution mandates that laws enacted in the colonial era should align\n\nwith its provisions. 12 Constitutional interpretation emphasizes the “need to reverse the\n\nphilosophy of the colonial regime, which was founded on the subordination of the\n\nindividual to the state”. 13 The “assumptions which lay at the foundation of colonial rule\n\nhave undergone a fundamental transformation for a nation of individuals governed by\n\nthe Constitution”. 14 By recognizing the injustices in the colonial and pre-colonial era,\n\n“we can certainly set the course for the future”. 15 “In the transformation of society”\n\nagainst colonial and pre-colonial ideology, the Constitution “seeks to assure the values\n\nof a just, humane and compassionate existence to all her citizens”. 16\n\n\n12       Criminal laws of the colonial era continue to impact the postcolonial world.

The\n                     problem with the classification test is that what\n                     constitutes a reasonable classification is reduced to a\n                     mere formula: the quest for an intelligible differentia and\n                     the rational nexus to the object sought to be achieved.\n                     In doing so, the test of classification risks elevating form\n                     over substance.

Therefore, in situations where a\n                   subordinate legislation is challenged on the ground\n                   of manifest arbitrariness, this Court will proceed to\n                   determine whether the delegate has failed “to take\n                   into account very vital facts which either expressly or\n                   by necessary implication are required to be taken\n                   into consideration by the statute or, say, the\n                   Constitution.” In contrast, application of manifest\n                   arbitrariness to a plenary legislation passed by a\n                   competent legislation requires the Court to adopt a\n                   different standard because it carries greater\n                   immunity than a subordinate legislation.

First, there must be an\n                   intelligible differentia which distinguishes persons\n                   grouped together from others left out of the group.\n                   The phrase “intelligible differentia” means difference\n                   capable of being understood. The difference is\n                   capable of being understood when there is a\n                   yardstick to differentiate the class included and\n                   others excluded from the group. In the absence of\n                   the yardstick, the differentiation would be without a\n                   basis and hence, unreasonable. The basis of\n                   classification must be deducible from the provisions\n                   of the statute; surrounding circumstances or matters\n                   of common knowledge. In making the classification,\n                   the State is free to recognize degrees of harm.\n                   Though the classification need not be mathematical\n\n\n51 2024 INSC 652\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_59\">                                                                                       22</span>\n\f                                                                                  PART VI\n\n                    in precision, there must be some difference between\n                    the persons grouped and the persons left out, and\n                    the difference must be real and pertinent. The\n                    classification is unreasonable if there is “little or no\n                    difference”. Second, the differentia must have a\n                    rational relation to the object sought to be achieved\n                    by the law, that is, the basis of classification must\n                    have a nexus with the object of the classification.”\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_26\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"137059642\" id=\"span_60\">34     The constitutional standards <a href=\"/doc/137059642/\" id=\"a_62\">laid down by</a> the Court under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_63\">Article 14</a> can be\n\nsummarized as follows. First, the Constitution permits classification if there is\n\nintelligible differentia and reasonable nexus with the object sought. Second, the\n\nclassification test cannot be merely applied as a mathematical formula to reach a\n\nconclusion. A challenge under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_64\">Article 14</a> has to take into account the substantive\n\ncontent of equality which mandates fair treatment of an individual. Third, in undertaking\n\nclassification, a legislation or subordinate legislation cannot be manifestly arbitrary, i.e.\n\ncourts must adjudicate whether the legislature or executive acted capriciously,\n\nirrationally and/or without adequate determining principle, or did something which is\n\nexcessive and disproportionate. In applying this constitutional standard, courts must\n\nidentify the “real purpose” of the statute rather than the “ostensible purpose” presented\n\nby the State, as summarized in ADR. Fourth, a provision can be found manifestly\n\narbitrary even if it does not make a classification. Fifth, different constitutional\n\nstandards have to be applied when testing the validity of legislation as compared to\n\nsubordinate legislation.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_27\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_28\">VI.

After all, the State is expected to prevent discrimination, not perpetuate\n\nit. That is why our Constitution prohibits the State from discriminating against any\n\ncitizen. Besides, <a href=\"/doc/1952106/\" id=\"a_68\">Article 15(2)</a> was adopted to specifically prohibit the discrimination\n\nfaced by certain marginalized communities in accessing public services and\n\nresources. Historically, the so-called untouchable community was not allowed to use\n\npublic resources such as water tanks and wells.

Discrimination can also be done by continuously\n\nridiculing or humiliating someone, who is on the weaker side of the social spectrum.

However, when the focus switches to\n                    the effects of the concerned action, we enter the\n                    territory of indirect discrimination. An enquiry as to\n                    indirect discrimination looks, not at the form of the\n                    impugned conduct, but at its consequences. In a\n                    case of direct discrimination, the judicial enquiry is\n                    confined to the act or conduct at issue, abstracted\n                    from the social setting or background fact-situation\n                    in which the act or conduct takes place. In indirect\n                    discrimination, on the other hand, the subject matter\n                    of the enquiry is the institutional or societal\n                    framework within which the impugned conduct\n                    occurs. The doctrine seeks to broaden the scope of\n                    antidiscrimination law to equip the law to remedy\n                    patterns of discrimination that are not as easily\n                    discernible.”\n\nThe Court however held that “[i]n order to conceptualize substantive equality, it would\n\nbe apposite to conduct a systemic analysis of discrimination that combines tools of\n\ndirect and indirect discrimination”, and not just the claim of either of the two. To evaluate\n\nthe claim of discrimination, the Court laid down the following test:\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">                    “A particular discriminatory practice or provision\n                    might often be insufficient to expose the entire gamut\n                    of discrimination that a particular structure may\n                    perpetuate. Exclusive reliance on tools of direct or\n                    indirect discrimination may also not effectively\n                    account for patterns arising out of multiple axles of\n                    discrimination. Therefore, a systemic view of\n                    discrimination,     in    perceiving     discriminatory\n                    disadvantage as a continuum, would account for not\n                    just unjust action but also inaction. Structures, in the\n                    form of organizations or otherwise, would be probed\n                    for the systems or cultures they produce that\n                    influence day-today interaction and decision-\n                    making. The duty of constitutional courts, when\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_75\">                                                                                          30</span>\n\f                                                                                    PART VI\n\n                     confronted with such a scheme of things, would not\n                     just be to strike down the discriminatory practices\n                     and compensate for the harm hitherto arising out of\n                     them; but also structure adequate reliefs and\n                     remedies that facilitate social redistribution by\n                     providing for positive entitlements that aim to negate\n                     the scope of future harm…\n\n                     Therefore, an analysis of discrimination, with a view\n                     towards its systemic manifestations (direct and\n                     indirect), would be best suited for achieving our\n                     constitutional     vision    of     equality      and\n                     antidiscrimination. Systemic discrimination on\n                     account of gender at the workplace would then\n                     encapsulate the patriarchal disadvantage that\n                     permeates all aspects of her being from the outset,\n                     including reproduction, sexuality and private choices\n                     which operate within an unjust structure.”\n\nApplying the above principles, the Court concluded that the process adopted by the\n\nArmy to grant Permanent Commissions to women officers “did not redress the harms\n\nof gendered discrimination that were identified by this Court in Babita Puniya”. The\n\nCourt found the evaluation process to be an instance of “indirect discrimination” and\n\n“systemic     discrimination”,    which     “disproportionately      affects   women”.   “This\n\ndiscrimination”, it was held, “has caused an economic and psychological harm and an\n\naffront to their dignity”.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_43\">46      The petitioner in Nipun Malhotra v.

Such representation is\n                    problematic not because it offends subjective\n                    feelings but rather, because it impairs the objective\n                    societal treatment of the affected groups by society.\n                    We believe that representation of persons with\n                    disabilities must regard the objective social context\n                    of their representation and not marginalise persons\n                    with disability…”\n\n\n47     The jurisprudence evolved by this Court shows that discriminatory laws have\n\nno place in our democracy. Discriminatory laws based on stereotypes against a social\n\ngroup were stuck down in judgments like Anuj Garg, Navtej Johar, Joseph Shine,\n\nand Indian Young Lawyers Association. Through judgments like NALSA and\n\nBabita Puniya, this Court recognized the dignity and aspirations of social groups\n\nwhich have traditionally faced exclusion from equal rights. This Court recognized\n\nindirect discrimination and systemic discrimination in Lt. Col.

Referring to the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1189857/\" id=\"a_202\">Bonded Labour System\n\n(Abolition) Act</a> 1976, the judgment discussed the meaning of “bonded labour”.\n\nAccording to the Act, a bonded labourer is someone who has incurred or is presumed\n\nto have incurred a bonded debt. 117 A bonded debt refers to an advance received or\n\npresumed to have been received by a bonded labourer under or in pursuance of the\n\nbonded labour system. 118 The inference of this definition, according to the State\n\ngovernment, was that bonded labourers must first prove that they are providing forced\n\nlabour in consideration of an advance or other economic consideration received by\n\nthem. The Court rejected this reasoning, stating that it would be “cruel to insist” that a\n\nbonded labourer “should have to go through a formal process of trial with the normal\n\nprocedure for recording of evidence.” It was further observed that “a bonded labourer\n\ncan never stand up to the rigidity and formalism of the legal process due to his poverty,\n\nilliteracy and social and economic backwardness and if such a procedure were\n\nrequired to be followed, the State Government might as well obliterate this Act from\n\nthe statute book”. The Court also noted that statistically, “most of bonded labourers\n\nare members of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes or other backward classes”.\n\n\n\n\n116 (1984) 3 SCC 161\n117 <a href=\"/doc/1212047/\" id=\"a_203\">Section 2(f)</a>, Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act 1976\n118 <a href=\"/doc/1004999/\" id=\"a_204\">Section 2(d)</a>, Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act 1976\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_132\">                                                                                        52</span>\n\f                                                                            PART IX\n\n78      The judgment held that whenever a labourer is made to provide forced labour,\n\nthe presumption would be that it is consideration of an advance or other economic\n\nconsideration received by him, and he is thus a bonded labourer. This presumption\n\nmay, however, be rebutted by the employer or the State Government by providing\n\nsatisfactory material. The Court reiterated the constitutional obligation of the Union\n\ngovernment and the State government to ensure observance of various social welfare\n\nand labour laws enacted for the benefit of the workmen. The State government was\n\ndirected “to take up the work of identification of bonded labour as one of their top\n\npriority tasks and to map out areas of concentration of bonded labour”. The concurring\n\nopinion regarded <a href=\"/doc/1071750/\" id=\"a_205\">Article 23</a> as “a vital constituent of the Fundamental Rights”.\n\n\n79      Pursuant to this Court’s decision in Bandhua Mukti Morcha, 135 bonded\n\nlabourers were released from bondage in stone quarries of Faridabad district, under\n\nthe provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1189857/\" id=\"a_206\">Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976</a>.

This Court also\n\ndirected the State government to ascertain within its territory whether there were any\n\nmore bonded labourers or not, by applying the principle <a href=\"/doc/1012224/\" id=\"a_208\">laid down in</a> Bandhua Mukti\n\nMorcha.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1229009\" id=\"span_134\">It was reiterated, “Whenever it is found that any workman is forced to provide\n\nlabour for no remuneration or nominal remuneration, the presumption would be that\n\n\n\n\n119 (1984) 3 SCC 243\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_135\">                                                                                   53</span>\n\f                                                                               PART IX\n\nhe is a bonded labourer unless the employer or the State Government is in a position\n\nto prove otherwise by rebutting such presumption.”\n\n\n80      The issue of bonded labourers in stone quarries in several districts of Andhra\n\nPradesh was highlighted before this Court in <a href=\"/doc/1229009/\" id=\"a_209\">P.

The Court appealed for\n\n“requisite social consciousness”, where it is “the obligation of every citizen to\n\ncooperate” to bring an end to bonded labour.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_79\">\n81      In State of Gujarat v. Hon’ble High Court of Gujarat, 121 a three-judge Bench\n\ndealt with the question whether prisoners, who are required to do labour as part of\n\ntheir punishment should be paid minimum wages for such work. This Court held that\n\njail authorities are “enjoined by law to impose hard labour” on convicted prisoners who\n\nwere sentenced to rigorous imprisonment, irrespective of “whether he consents to do\n\nit or not”. However, undertrials, detainees with simple imprisonment, or even detenus\n\nwho are kept in jails as preventive measures cannot be “asked to do manual work\n\nduring their prison term.” Justice KT Thomas, speaking for the Court, held that “a\n\ndirective from the court under the authority of law to subject a convicted person (who\n\nwas sentenced to rigorous imprisonment) to compulsory manual labour gets legal\n\nprotection under the exemption provided in Clause (2) of <a href=\"/doc/1071750/\" id=\"a_210\">Article 23</a> of the Constitution,\n\nas it “serves a public purpose” of reforming the convict and rehabilitating them in future\n\nwith savings earned from such labour.

He, however, observed that the State is free to enact legislation for\n\ngranting wages to prisoners subject to hard labour under courts’ orders, for their\n\nbeneficial purpose or otherwise.

One of us (Justice DY Chandrachud) authored\n\nthe judgment, declaring that the notifications issued by the government during the\n\npandemic were ultra vires and against the fundamental rights of labourers. The Court\n\nstated that “[t]o a worker who has faced the brunt of the pandemic and is currently\n\nlaboring in a workplace without the luxury of physical distancing, economic dignity\n\nbased on the rights available under the statute is the least that this Court can ensure\n\nthem.” It was held that “[t]he notifications, in denying humane working conditions and\n\novertime wages provided by law, are an affront to the workers’ right to life and rights\n\nagainst forced labour that are secured by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_221\">Articles 21</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1071750/\" id=\"a_222\">23</a> of the Constitution.”\n\n\n85     What emerges from the above discussion is that the broad scope of <a href=\"/doc/1071750/\" id=\"a_223\">Article 23</a>\n\ncan be invoked to challenge practices where no wages are paid, non-payment of\n\nminimum wages takes place, social security measures for workers are not adopted,\n\nrehabilitation for bonded labour does not happen, and in similar unfair practices.

A History of Discrimination in the Pre-Colonial Era\n\n\n87     The history of India has witnessed centuries of discrimination towards the\n\noppressed castes. Violence, discrimination, oppression, hatred, contempt, and\n\nhumiliation, towards these communities were the norm. The caste system entrenched\n\nthese social injustices deeply within society, creating an environment where the\n\nprinciples of natural justice were blatantly disregarded. In this hierarchical system,\n\nneutrality was virtually non-existent, and there was an inherent and pervasive bias\n\nagainst those belonging to the oppressed castes. This bias manifested in numerous\n\nways, including exclusion from social, economic, and political opportunities. The caste\n\nsystem ensured that the oppressed castes remained marginalized and deprived of\n\ntheir basic rights and dignity.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_84\">\n88     The foundational principle of equality for all individuals was absent in the social\n\nframework defined by caste. The caste system operated as a mechanism that thrived\n\non the labour of Bahujan communities, ultimately eroding their identity. In other words,\n\nthe story of the caste system is, therefore, a story of enduring injustice. It is a narrative\n\nof how millions of Indians, relegated to the bottom of the social ladder, faced relentless\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_141\">                                                                                          57</span>\n\f                                                                                                  PART X\n\ndiscrimination and exploitation. The lower castes were systematically denied access\n\nto education, land and employment, further entrenching their disadvantaged position\n\nin society.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_85\">\n89      The caste system led to harrowing practices of discrimination and subjugation,\n\nrooted in the notions of purity and pollution, where some communities were deemed\n\nimpure, and their presence was considered contaminated. The penal sanctions and\n\ndiscriminatory practices under the caste system have been well-documented in\n\nseveral scholarly works. Dr. Ambedkar referred to this as the “law of caste” in his\n\nwritings. 125\n\n\n90      The caste system was based on four varnas or groupings. Dr. Ambedkar\n\ndescribed the caste system in the following words:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_86\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_48\">                        “One striking feature of the caste system is that the\n                        different castes do not stand as an horizontal series\n                        all on the same plane.

In “Castes in India”, he stated: “Sati, enforced\n\nwidowhood and girl marriage are customs that were primarily intended to solve the\n\nproblem of the surplus man and surplus woman in a caste and to maintain its\n\nendogamy. Strict endogamy could not be preserved without these customs, while\n\ncaste without endogamy is a fake.” 129\n\n\n92         Scholars have also stated that “the idea of criminal tribe” 130 existed even before\n\nthe British colonisers. Anthropologist Anastasia Piliavsky noted, “while colonial uses\n\nof the stereotype add up to a lurid history of violence against people branded as\n\ncongenital criminals in colonial law, the stereotype itself has a history stretching back\n\nfar beyond British colonialism.” 131\n\n\n\n\n127 B.R.

First, it was based on a\n\nhierarchy of four caste-based groupings, where the Shudras occupied the lowest level.\n\nSecond, the castes outside these four groupings were treated as “untouchables”.\n\nThird, the caste system controlled the sexuality or agency of women to maintain the\n\nsanctity of caste. Fourth, the caste structure considered certain castes and tribal\n\ncommunities as professional criminals. Fifth, penal sanctions were imposed on those\n\nwho violated the “law of caste”.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_89\">\n94     The rules of caste continued in medieval history.

The Colonial Suppression of Marginalized Castes and Tribes\n\n\n95     The colonial history indicates that the British reproduced the systems of social\n\nhierarchy in their legal framework. Following several revolts from indigenous\n\ncommunities in India, in particular their participation in the 1857 revolt, the British\n\nfocused on restricting their activities. The British increased surveillance upon them by\n\nthe Thuggee Act (XXX of 1836) and Dacoity Act (XXIV of 1843).\n\n\n96     Reference must be drawn to the statement of J. F.

This\n\nprovided an affirmation of the State that any person who belonged to such a tribe was\n\nborn as a criminal. Between the period 1871 and 1949, a large number of communities\n\nwere registered as “criminal tribes”.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_132\">\n113    The separation of children from their families led to the destruction of their\n\nchildhood and deprived them of their innocence. They were considered as young\n\noffenders. The criminal tribes were subjected to inhuman living conditions, as they\n\nwere required to mark their attendance even during late nights. The idea of\n\nrehabilitation of the so-called criminal tribes also led to the exploitation of their labour.\n\nOstensibly meant to “reform”, the settlements provided for institutionalized\n\nincarceration. The compulsive stay in “settlement camps” led to many nomadic groups\n\nleaving their traditional livelihoods involuntarily. These camps, created by the Act,\n\ndistanced the criminal tribes from mainstream society. Harsh provisions on\n\npunishment for members of the criminal tribes were imposed.\n\n\n114    American sociologist John Lewis Gillin travelled across India to document the\n\nsituation of settlement camps. He noted:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_133\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_56\">                    “There are four types of settlements besides the\n                    institutions for children and loose women: (a)\n                    Industrial settlements near some large industrial\n                    plant such as a cotton mill, railroad shops, or a large\n                    tea plantation; (b) agricultural settlements.

This would virtually amount to “begar” or forced\n                  labour which is an offence under the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_297\">Indian Penal Code</a> and is\n                  opposed also to <a href=\"/doc/1071750/\" id=\"a_298\">Article 23</a> of the Constitution.”212\n\n\n\n209 Ibid\n210 Ibid\n211 Ibid, p. 82\n212 Ibid, p. 82\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_161\">                                                                                               76</span>\n\f                                                                                                         PART XII\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_146\">125       The Committee recommended the repeal of the Act:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_69\">                          “The Criminal Tribes Act, 1924, should be replaced\n                          by a Central legislation applicable to all habitual\n                          offenders without any distinction based on caste,\n                          creed or birth and the newly formed States included\n                          in Parts B and C of the First Schedule of the\n                          Constitution, which have local laws for the\n                          surveillance of the Criminal Tribes, should be\n                          advised to replace their laws in this respect by the\n                          Central legislation for habitual offenders, when\n                          passed.” 213\n\n<a href=\"/doc/17412906/\" id=\"a_299\">The Act</a> was repealed in 1952.

It is for this reason <a href=\"/doc/281651/\" id=\"a_301\">Article 341(1)</a> of the\n\nConstitution employs the words “castes” and “tribes” while defining the Scheduled\n\nCastes. 214 After the repeal of the Act, some of the castes earlier declared as criminal\n\ntribes, have been accordingly notified as Scheduled Castes.\n\n\nXII.      Jurisprudence on Social Protection in Post-Independence India\n\n\n127       Parliament enacted legislation to prevent discrimination and atrocities against\n\nthe Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"514077\" id=\"span_162\">In <a href=\"/doc/514077/\" id=\"a_302\">State of Karnataka v.

Ram Krishna Balothia</a> 216 held that\n\nthe offences under PoA Act “constitute a separate class and cannot be compared with\n\noffences under the Penal Code”. These offences are “committed to humiliate and\n\nsubjugate members of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes with a view to keeping\n\nthem in a state of servitude”, and “prevent them from leading a life of dignity and self-\n\nrespect”. The Court quoted the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Act to\n\nhighlight that “when members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes assert\n\ntheir rights and demand statutory protection, vested interests try to cow them down\n\nand terrorise them” if they are on anticipatory bail. For this reason, the Court dismissed\n\na challenge to Section 18 of the PoA Act, which debarred the opportunity to seek\n\nanticipatory bail in respect of offences committed under the Act.</span>\n\n\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"6155772\" id=\"span_165\">129      In <a href=\"/doc/6155772/\" id=\"a_306\">Safai Karamchari Andolan v.

Making a “member of a\n\nScheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe to do manual scavenging or employing or\n\npermiting the employment of such member for such purpose” is a criminal offence\n\nunder the PoA Act. 218 The Court took a step further, and held that “entering sewer lines\n\nwithout safety gears should be made a crime even in emergency situations”. The Court\n\ndeclared that for a death in sewer lines, “compensation of Rs. 10 lakhs should be given\n\nto the family of the deceased”.

Union of India</a>. 219 It remarked that\n\n“there has been a failure on the part of the authorities concerned in complying with the\n\nprovisions” of the PoA Act. Calling out the “indifferent attitude of the authorities”, the\n\nCourt directed the State and the Union governments to strictly do their role in\n\nimplementing the Act.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_149\">\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"108728085\" id=\"span_168\">131     These rulings emphasized that the PoA Act is a significant legislative measure\n\ndesigned to protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of the Scheduled Castes and\n\nScheduled Tribes, ensuring their dignity and safety against discrimination and\n\nviolence. However, the subsequent judgment in <a href=\"/doc/108728085/\" id=\"a_309\">Subhash Kashinath Mahajan v.\n\nState of Maharashtra</a> 220 marked a departure from this protective stance.\n\n\n132     Dealing with a criminal appeal, the judgment in Subhash Mahajan expressed\n\na “concern that working of the Atrocities [PoA] Act should not result in perpetuating\n\ncasteism which can have an adverse impact on integration of the society and the\n\nconstitutional values”. It held that there is “no absolute bar against grant of anticipatory\n\nbail” by the concerned court “in cases under the Atrocities [PoA] Act if no prima facie\n\ncase is made out or where on judicial scrutiny the complaint is found to be prima facie\n\nmala fide”. The Court issued the following guidelines:</span>\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_70\">                      “(iii) In view of acknowledged abuse of law of arrest\n                      in cases under the Atrocities Act, arrest of a public\n                      servant can only be after approval of the appointing\n                      authority and of a non-public servant after approval\n                      by the S.S.P. which may be granted in appropriate\n                      cases if considered necessary for reasons recorded.\n                      Such reasons must be scrutinized by the Magistrate\n                      for permitting further detention;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_71\">219 AIR 2017 SC 132\n220 2018 INSC 248\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_169\">                                                                                         79</span>\n\f                                                                                PART XII\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_72\">                     (iv) To avoid false implication of an innocent, a\n                     preliminary enquiry may be conducted by the DSP\n                     concerned to find out whether the allegations make\n                     out a case under the Atrocities Act and that the\n                     allegations are not frivolous or motivated;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_150\">                     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"90225896\" id=\"span_170\">(v) Any violation of direction (iii) and (iv) will be\n                     actionable by way of disciplinary action as well as\n                     contempt.”\n\n\n\n133     The directions in Subhash Mahajan were later recalled in the review petition\n\nin <a href=\"/doc/90225896/\" id=\"a_310\">Union of India v. State of Maharashtra</a>. 221 In doing so, the Court noted that the\n\nScheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes “are still making the struggle for equality\n\nand for exercising civil rights in various areas of the country”. It remarked that there is\n\n“no presumption that the members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes\n\nmay misuse the provisions of law as a class”. Instead, “members of the Scheduled\n\nCastes and Scheduled Tribes due to backwardness hardly muster the courage to\n\nlodge even a first information report, much less, a false one”. The Court further\n\ndeclared that treating the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes as “prone to\n\nlodge false reports under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Act for taking\n\nrevenge” or monetary gain, especially when they themselves are victims of such\n\noffenses, contradicts fundamental principles of human equality.\n\n\n134     The review judgment also observed that guidelines issued in Subhash\n\nMahajan “may delay the investigation of cases”. The judgment termed the directions\n\nas “discriminatory”, as “it puts the members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled\n\nTribes in a disadvantageous position”, compared to complaints lodged by members of\n\nupper castes, where no such preliminary investigation is required. The Court also\n\nfound the directions to be “without statutory basis”, as they are in conflict with PoA Act,\n\n\n\n221 2019 INSC 1102\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_171\">                                                                                        80</span>\n\f                                                                                                      PART XII\n\nand amounts to “encroaching on a field which is reserved for the legislature”. The\n\nCourt however clarified that “if prima facie case has not been made out attracting the\n\nprovisions” of PoA Act, “the bar created under <a href=\"/doc/136772612/\" id=\"a_311\">section 18</a> on the grant of anticipatory\n\nbail is not attracted”.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_151\">\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"31336209\" id=\"span_172\">135      Before the review judgment was delivered, Parliament amended the PoA Act,\n\nundoing the effect of the guidelines issued in Subhash Mahajan.

Satyanarayan</a>. 223 The Court\n\ncancelled the bail of an accused on the ground that the statutory requirement of\n\nSection 15A 224 of PoA Act was not fulfilled in the case. Authoring the judgment, one of\n\nus (Justice DY Chandrachud) noted:</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_152\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_73\">                         “Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes\n                         specifically suffer on account of procedural lapses in\n                         the     criminal    justice    system.    They   face\n                         insurmountable hurdles in accessing justice from the\n                         stage of filing the complaint to the conclusion of the\n                         trial. Due to the fear of retribution from members of\n                         upper caste groups, ignorance or police apathy,\n                         many victims do not register complaints in the first\n                         place. If victims or their relatives muster up the\n                         courage to approach the police, the police officials\n                         are reluctant to register complaints or do not record\n                         allegations accurately. Eventually, if the case does\n                         get registered, the victims and witnesses are\n                         vulnerable to intimidation, violence and social and\n                         economic boycott. Further, many perpetrators of\n                         caste based atrocities get away scot-free due to\n                         shoddy investigations and the negligence of\n                         prosecuting advocates. This results in low conviction\n                         rates under the SC/ST Act giving rise to the\n\n222 (2020) 4 SCC 727\n223 2021 INSC 701\n224 <a href=\"/doc/17412906/\" id=\"a_314\">Section 15A(5)</a> of the Act provides: “A victim or his dependent shall be entitled to be heard at any proceeding\n\nunder this Act in respect of bail, discharge, release, parole, conviction or sentence of an accused or any connected\nproceedings or arguments and file written submission on conviction, acquittal or sentencing.”\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_174\">                                                                                                                81</span>\n\f                                                                             PART XII\n\n                    erroneous perception that cases registered under\n                    the Act are false and that it is being misused.

This is\n                    evident from the low percentage of cases attracting\n                    the application of the provisions of the Penal Code\n                    relating to false complaints as compared to the rate\n                    of acquittals.”\n\n                                                      (emphasis added)\n\nThe Court observed that the provisions of the PoA Act, in particular Section 15A,\n\n“enable a member of the marginalized caste to effectively pursue a case and\n\ncounteract the effects of defective investigations”.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_153\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"138189653\" id=\"span_175\">137     In <a href=\"/doc/138189653/\" id=\"a_315\">Patan Jamal Vali v.

The caste hierarchy\n\noutside the prison was replicated within the prison.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_262\">152     The Committee’s recommendations for including a common mess instead of\n\nfood allowances for prisoners to cook their own meals, which was greater\n\naccommodation of caste, were shelved. In the 1840s, prisoners were granted food\n\nallowances and they could prepare their own meals, duly observing their caste\n\npractices. To replace this, a stricter mess system was introduced in some prisons.\n\nHowever, prisoners were divided along caste lines and each group was assigned a\n\ndifferent prisoner cook. Among Europeans outside the prison system, “there was\n\nbewilderment, even rage, at the extent to which caste had been ‘basely and indecently\n\nsuccumbed to in our Indian jails’”. 235\n\n\n\n234 Committee on Prison Discipline to the Governor General of India in Council, 1838, page 106.\n235 David Arnold and David Hardiman (eds.), Subaltern Studies VIII: Essays in Honour of Ranajit\n\nGuha, Oxford University Press (1994), pp. 148-187, at p. 172\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_206\">                                                                                                       105</span>\n\f                                                                                                     PART XIV\n\n153      But the British prison administration broadly agreed that caste must be\n\nrespected even inside prisons. An 1862 Report of the Inspector of Prisons in Oudh\n\nshowed that in Lucknow Central Jail, these prejudices were entertained to the extent\n\nthat Brahmin inmates would be allowed to bathe before they ate and to mark out a\n\ndesignated area where they would receive their food and where no one would be\n\nallowed to enter. 236 David Arnold wrote about the complexity of managing caste in\n\nIndian prisons and the administration’s fears:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_106\">                         “With regard to caste and community, the issue was\n                         more complex. Physical labour was the mark of the\n                         lowest Hindu castes (and their Muslim counter parts),\n                         while such ritually polluting tasks as shoemaking,\n                         which involved handling leather, or the removal of\n                         human urine and excrement, were regarded as the\n                         stigmatising occupations of the very lowest castes, the\n                         untouchables. Was it, therefore, legitimate penal\n                         practice to force high-caste Hindus, or well-born\n                         (ashraf) Muslims, to toil as if they were from labouring\n                         or untouchable castes? Was denial of caste status a\n                         morally justified attribute of prison life, even a fitting\n                         deterrent against further criminal acts?

Phrases such as “menial”\n\njobs to be performed by castes “accustomed to perform such duties” may appear to\n\nbe facially neutral, but refer to marginalized communities, given the history of systemic\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_219\">                                                                                        114</span>\n\f                                                                          PART XIV\n\ndiscrimination against them. Such indirect usages of phrases, which target the so-\n\ncalled ‘lower castes’, cannot be permitted in our constitutional framework. The\n\nphrases, though neutral on their face, carry an embedded bias that disadvantages\n\nmarginalized communities by reinforcing historical patterns of labour based on caste.\n\nEven if caste is not explicitly mentioned, phrases like “menial” and “accustomed”\n\nindirectly uphold traditional caste roles. These provisions disproportionately harm\n\nmarginalized castes, perpetuate caste-based labour divisions and reinforce social\n\nhierarchies.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_285\">\n173    The manuals/rules are also based on and reinforce stereotypes against the\n\nmarginalized castes. These stereotypes not only demean and stigmatize marginalized\n\ncommunities but also serve to maintain and legitimize a social hierarchy that goes\n\nagainst the constitutional values of equality. The persistence of such associations in\n\nofficial documents like the Manuals/Rules normalizes the idea that these tasks are\n\nsomehow natural for marginalized communities, reinforcing harmful societal\n\nhierarchies. By assigning specific types of work to marginalized castes based on their\n\nsupposed &quot;customary&quot; roles, the Manuals perpetuate the stereotype that people from\n\nthese communities are either incapable of or unfit for more skilled, dignified, or\n\nintellectual work.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_286\">\n174    The manuals/rules also reinforce stereotypes against denotified tribes. Rule\n\n404 of the West Bengal Manual provides that a convict overseer may be appointed to\n\nbe a night guard provided that “he does not belong to any class that may have a strong\n\nnatural tendency to escape, such as men of wandering tribes”. The Madhya Pradesh\n\nManual permits the classification of habitual and non-habitual criminals, where\n\nhabitual criminals are described as someone who “is by habit member of a gang of\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_220\">                                                                                  115</span>\n\f                                                                             PART XIV\n\ndacoits, or of thieves or a dealer in slaves or in stolen property”, even if no previous\n\nconviction has been proved. Furthermore, any member of a denotified tribe may be\n\ntreated as a habitual criminal, subject to the discretion of the State Government. 250\n\nSimilarly, Rule 217 of the Andhra Pradesh Manual, Rule 219 of the Tamil Nadu Manual,\n\nand Rule 201 of the Kerala Manual classify as “habitual criminals” those who are by\n\n“habit” a “robber, housebreaker, dacoit, thief or receiver of stolen property” or that he\n\n“habitually commits extortion, cheating, counterfeiting coin, currency notes or stamps\n\nor forgery”, even if “no previous conviction has been proved, that he is by habit a\n\nmember of a gang of dacoits, or of thieves or a dealer in stolen property”. The Andhra\n\nManual also paints “a member of a wandering or criminal tribe” with the same brush\n\nof being “a bad or dangerous character, or has, at any time, escaped of attempted to\n\nescape from lawful custody”, and prohibits their employment on any labour outside the\n\nwalls of the prison, or to be permitted to pass out of the prison for employment of the\n\npurpose of being so employed. 251 The Manual also describes “non-habitual prisoners\n\nof good character” as someone who “by social status, education and habit of life have\n\nbeen accustomed to a superior mode of living”. Conversely, habitual prisoners are\n\naccustomed to an inferior mode of living. 252 The Odisha Manual and Rajasthan Manual\n\nalso prohibit employment on extramural work of “Prisoners who have shown, or are\n\nlikely to have, a strong inclination to escape or are members of a wandering or criminal\n\ntribe”. The Odisha Rules 253 and Tamil Nadu Rules 254 prescribe the separation of\n\nhabitual offenders from other prisoners.

When such stereotypes become a part of the legal\n\nframework, they legitimize discrimination against these communities. Members of the\n\ndenotified tribes have faced the brunt of colonial caste-based undertones of\n\ndiscriminating against them, and the prison Manuals are reaffirming the same\n\ndiscrimination. Discrimination against denotified tribes is prohibited under the ground\n\nof “caste” in <a href=\"/doc/1942013/\" id=\"a_368\">Article 15(1)</a>, as the colonial regime considered them as belonging to\n\nseparate hereditary castes.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_287\">\n</p><pre id=\"pre_10\">(iv)     Whether a “practice” of untouchability?\n\n\n176      At the risk of repetition, we must reproduce some of the impugned provisions.\n\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_288\">Rule 289(g) of the Uttar Pradesh Manual provides: “A convict sentenced to simple\n\nimprisonment,… shall not be called upon to perform duties of a degrading or menial\n\ncharacter unless he belongs to a class or community accustomed to perform such\n\nduties; but may be required to carry water for his own use provided he belongs to the\n\nclass of society the members of which are accustomed to perform such duties in their\n\nown homes.” Rule 158 states: “Remission to convicts on scavenging duty - Subject to\n\ngood work and conduct in jail, convicts of the scavenger class working as scavengers\n\nin jails…”\n\n\n\n\n255 Chapter XLI, Section II: Rule 3, Maharashtra Rules\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_222\">                                                                                   117</span>\n\f                                                                             PART XIV\n\n177    Rule 694 of West Bengal Manual provides: “… Interference with genuine\n\nreligious practices or caste prejudices of prisoners should be avoided”.

The caste system rigidly assigns certain\n\ntasks to specific communities based on birth, with the lowest castes, being relegated\n\nto tasks considered impure or unclean, such as manual scavenging, cleaning, and\n\nother forms of physical labour. That a person belonging to such a community is\n\naccustomed to performing menial tasks is a mandate of the caste system.

If such practices are based on the oppression of the marginalized castes,\n\nthen such practices cannot be left untouched. The Constitution mandates an end to\n\ncaste discrimination and untouchability. The provision that food shall be cooked by\n\n“suitable caste” reflects notions of untouchability, where certain castes are considered\n\nsuitable for cooking or handling kitchen work, while others are not. Besides, the\n\ndivision of work on the basis of caste is a practice of untouchability prohibited under\n\nthe Constitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_290\">\n181    As discussed, prison manuals allot tasks of a barber to individuals from a\n\ncertain caste, while sweeping work is allowed to Mehtar/Hari/Chandal or similar\n\ncastes. It is also provided that work shall be allotted on the basis of “attitude and sofar\n\nas may be practicable with due regard to his previous habits.” This is a caste-based\n\ndelegation of work based on the perceptions of the caste system that certain castes\n\nare meant to do jobs of “sweeping”. The rule that a prisoner of a high caste be allowed\n\nto refuse the food cooked by other castes is a legal sanction by the State authorities\n\nto untouchability and the caste system.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_291\">\n182    Let us refer again to the impugned provisions which deal with “habits” of certain\n\ncommunities.

These\n\nstereotypes not only criminalize entire communities but also reinforce caste-based\n\nprejudices. They resemble a form of untouchability, as they assign certain negative\n\ntraits to specific groups based on identity, perpetuating their marginalization and\n\nexclusion. By marking them as “criminal by birth,” the law institutionalized a prejudiced\n\nview of these tribes, treating them as inherently dishonest and prone to theft. This\n\nstereotype—echoing elements of untouchability—reduced their humanity to a set of\n\nnegative traits and perpetuated their exclusion from mainstream society. Once labelled\n\na criminal tribe, individuals from these communities faced systematic discrimination in\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_225\">                                                                                      120</span>\n\f                                                                            PART XIV\n\nemployment, education, and social services. The stigma attached to these labels\n\nextended beyond legal frameworks and became a part of social consciousness\n\n\n184    The provision that a “non-habitual” prisoner is “by social status” and “habit of\n\nlife… accustomed to a superior mode of living” is another caste-based construct. This\n\nhierarchical view of social status plays into the caste-based division of labour and\n\nmorality that has long been entrenched in Indian society. While those from higher\n\ncastes or classes were perceived as refined and deserving of more lenient treatment\n\n(even within the colonial criminal justice system), those from lower castes or\n\nmarginalized communities were viewed as having a natural tendency towards\n\ncriminality or immorality. This was not only an injustice but also reinforced existing\n\npower structures, ensuring that marginalized groups were trapped in cycles of poverty\n\nand discrimination, unable to transcend the stigmatization they faced.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_292\">(v)    The right to overcome caste prejudices under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_370\">Article 21\n\n\n185</a>    The impugned rules foster the antiquated notions of fitness of a particular\n\ncommunity for a certain designated job.

A reference was made to the definition of “habitual offenders” to argue that it is\n\nmisused against persons from denotified tribes in prison. It has been submitted that\n\nthe Ministry of Home Affairs may be directed to incorporate and reform the Model\n\nPrison Manual, 2016, to address the highlighted issues.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_110\">200    The Model Prison Manual 2016 was prepared “to reflect the understanding\n\nbehind constitutional provisions, Supreme Court directions on prison administration\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_232\">                                                                                      127</span>\n\f                                                                                                  PART XV\n\nand international instruments”. 257 It covers a range of aspects relating to prisons,\n\nincluding institutional framework, custodial management, medical care, education and\n\ntraining of prisoners, maintenance of prisoners, emergency situations, remission,\n\nparole, premature releases and inspection of prisons, among other things. The Model\n\nPrison Manual 2016 also focuses on “prison computerization, special provisions for\n\nwomen prisoners, focus on after care services, rights of prisoners sentenced to death,\n\nrepatriation of prisoners from abroad, enhanced focus on prison correctional staff”. 258\n\nNew chapters on legal aid and inspection of prisons have been incorporated.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_111\">201        The Model Prison Manual 2016 suffers from several lacunae. The first issue to\n\nbe noted with reference to the Manual is its classification of “habitual offenders”. The\n\nManual defines “habitual offender” as “a prisoner classified as such in accordance with\n\nthe provisions of applicable law or rules”. 259 “Casual prisoner” is defined as “a prisoner\n\nother than a habitual offender”. 260 The Manual provides for “the setting up of separate\n\ninstitutional facilities for different categories of prisoners”, including “maximum security\n\nprisons/annexes/yards for high-risk prisoners and hardened or habitual offenders”. 261\n\nThe Manual mandates the classification of undertrial prisoners in three categories,\n\nwherein habitual offenders are tagged along with “Gangsters, hired Assassins, dacoits,\n\nserial killers/rapists/violent robbers, drug offenders, communal fanatics and those\n\nhighly prone to escapes/ previous escapees/attack on police and other dangerous\n\noffenders/including those prone to self-harm/posing threat to public order”. 262 The\n\nhabitual offenders are tagged in the same category in relation to classification of high\n\n\n\n\n257 Model Prison Manual 2016, p. 4, https://www.mha.gov.in/sites/default/files/PrisonManual2016.pdf\n258 Ibid\n259 Para 13 of Chapter I, Model Prison Manual 2016\n260 Para 3 of Chapter I, Model Prison Manual 2016\n261 Para 2.03 of Chapter II, Model Prison Manual 2016\n262 Ibid, Para 24.01\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_233\">                                                                                                      128</span>\n\f                                                                                 PART XV\n\nrisk offenders and for determination of the level of security for effective surveillance. 263\n\nSimilarly, regarding the women prisoners, it has been provided that “Habitual offenders\n\nshall be separated from casual prisoners” 264 and that “Habitual offenders, prostitutes\n\nand brothel keepers must also be confined separately”. 265\n\n\n202       In a previous section of this judgment, we highlighted that the phrase “habitual\n\noffender” in several prison manuals refers to people from denotified or wandering\n\ntribes. Therefore, this definition cannot be left to be interpreted and applied “in\n\naccordance with the provisions of applicable law or rules”. Otherwise, what it will end\n\nup doing is to classify and separate people from denotified tribes in prisons without\n\nany basis.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_112\">203       Second, the Manual does not explicitly prohibit physical caste-based\n\nsegregation of prisoners, except in prisons for women. Only the chapter on “Women\n\nPrisoners” provides that “[n]o classification of prisoners shall be allowed on grounds\n\nof socioeconomic status, caste or class”. 266 This is concerning, as the Manual was\n\nprepared in 2016, when prison manuals in different States mandated caste-based\n\ndivision of prisoners, as indicated in our analysis in the previous section. The Manual\n\nof 2016 therefore should have adopted a specific provision prohibiting the\n\nclassification of prisoners on the basis of caste for all prisoners, as it does in the case\n\nof women prisoners.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_113\">204       Third, the Manual does not prohibit division of work on the basis of caste, except\n\nin cooking. Para 2.12.4 provides that “Management of kitchen or cooking of food on\n\n\n\n\n263 Ibid, Para 25.02\n264 Ibid, Para 26.04 (ii)\n265 Ibid, 26.04 (iii)\n266 Ibid, Para 26.04 Note (ii)\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_234\">                                                                                         129</span>\n\f                                                                                 PART XV\n\ncaste or religious basis shall be prohibited in prisons”. Similarly, for women prisons,\n\npara 26.45 provides “Management of kitchens or cooking food on caste or religious\n\nbasis should be strictly banned in prisons for women”. In effect, prohibition of caste\n\ndiscrimination in kitchens shall also apply to allotment of work to cooks. 267 However,\n\nthe Manual does not prohibit discrimination on the allotment of work other than\n\ncooking. As analysed, various prison manuals in different States specify different work\n\nto people on the basis of caste. The Model Manual 2016 should have taken into\n\naccount such practices and provided specifically for their prohibition.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_114\">205       Instead, the Manual empowers the jail superintendent “for the execution of all\n\norders regarding the labour of prisoners” and that they “shall assign to each prisoner\n\nhis work on the recommendation of the classifying Committee constituted in each\n\nCentral Prison for the purpose”. 268 Furthermore, the medical officer shall “examine all\n\nnewly admitted prisoners and record in the admission register and medical sheets\n\nparticulars regarding their health, and the kind of labour they can perform in view of\n\ntheir health conditions”. 269 If the medical opinion states that “the health of any prisoner\n\nsuffers from employment of any kind or class of labour, he shall record such opinion\n\nin the prisoner&#x27;s sheet and the prisoner shall not be employed on that labour”. 270\n\nBesides, the Manual penalizes any resistance by the prisoners to perform labour\n\nallotted to them. “Wilfully disabling himself from labour” is listed as a prison offence. 271\n\n\n206       The above provisions prima facie may be essential to maintain prison discipline,\n\nbut absent any provision prohibiting caste-based allotment of work, these provisions\n\nmay be used to target prisoners from marginalized castes. It may create a scenario\n\n\n267 See Paras 6.30 and 6.31.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_115\">268 Ibid, Para 4.08.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_116\">269 Ibid, Para 7.45 (xxiii).\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_117\">270 Ibid, Para 7.67.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_118\">271 Ibid, Para 21.09 (xxxv).\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_235\">                                                                                         130</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_305\">\f                                                                                              PART XV\n\nwhere a prisoner from a marginalized caste may not be able to deny the work allotted\n\nto them on the basis of their caste, which would also be violative of the <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_385\">Articles 21</a> and\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1071750/\" id=\"a_386\">23</a> of the Constitution of India, which protects individual dignity and prohibits forced\n\nlabour. In this regard, we may again refer to Sunil Batra (II) 272 which held that\n\n“allotment of degrading labour” in prisons is “an infraction of liberty or life in its wider\n\nsense and cannot be sustained” unless the procedure under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_387\">Article 21</a> is satisfied. No\n\nsuch procedure which divides labour on the basis of caste can be sustained. This\n\nprohibition shall also apply to labour done in prison industries and skill development\n\nprogrammes under paras 15.30 and 15.31, work done by undertrial prisoners under\n\nparas 24.43 and 24.44, work done by high-risk offenders under paras 25.19, work\n\ndone by women prisoners under paras 26.106 to 26.109, and labour done by young\n\noffenders under paras 27.32 and 27.33.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_306\">\n207      Fourth, the counsel for the petitioner have argued that the Manual does not\n\nrefer to the provisions of the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and\n\ntheir Rehabilitation Act, 2013, which prohibit manual scavenging. Clauses 2.10 and\n\n6.79 deal with toilets. We clarify that the Act has a binding effect even on prisons.

In addition, prison offences include\n\n“wilfully hurting other’s religious feelings, beliefs and faiths”275 and “agitating or acting\n\non the basis of caste or religious prejudices”. 276 We clarify that no special treatment\n\nshall be given to any group of persons or individuals on the basis of caste in any\n\nscenario.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_308\">\nXVI.     Model Prisons and Correctional Services Act, 2023\n\n\n209      We now refer to the provisions of the “Model Prisons and Correctional Services\n\nAct, 2023”. The Ministry of Home Affairs, in consultation with various stakeholders,\n\nprepared this draft legislation and forwarded it to all States and Union Territories in\n\nMay 2023 for adoption in their respective jurisdictions. 277 The vision behind the\n\npreparation of the Model Act was to replace the previous colonial legislations, which\n\nhave been “found to be outdated and obsolete”, with “a progressive and robust Act\n\nwhich is in tune with contemporary modern day needs and correctional ideology”. 278\n\nAccording to the Ministry, the Model Act is “a comprehensive document which covers\n\nall relevant aspects of prison management, viz. security, safety, scientific &amp;\n\ntechnological interventions, segregation of prisoners, special provision for women\n\ninmates, taking appropriate action against criminal activities of prisoners in the prison,\n\ngrant of parole and furlough to prisoners, their education, vocational training and skill\n\ndevelopment, etc.” 279 The Ministry also indicated that as “Prison” is a “State” subject,\n\n“it is for the respective State Governments to make use of the guidance provided in\n\n\n\n275 Para 21.09 (xxxvii), Model Prison Manual 2016\n276 Ibid, Para 21.09 (xxxviii)\n277    Unstarred     Question   No.    3007     (Lok     Sabha, dated      8 August 2023),       available   at\nhttps://www.mha.gov.in/MHA1/Par2017/pdfs/par2023-pdfs/LS-08082023/3007.pdf\n278 Letter dated 10 May 2023 from Home Secretary, Government of India to Chief Secretaries, all States and UTs,\n\navailable at https://www.mha.gov.in/sites/default/files/advisory_10112023.pdf\n279    Unstarred     Question   No.    3007     (Lok     Sabha, dated      8 August 2023),       available   at\nhttps://www.mha.gov.in/MHA1/Par2017/pdfs/par2023-pdfs/LS-08082023/3007.pdf\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_238\">                                                                                                          132</span>\n\f                                                                                PART XVI\n\nthe Model Prisons and Correctional Services Act, 2023 and enact a suitable legislation\n\non Prisons in their jurisdictions for bringing improvement in prison management and\n\nadministration of prisoners.” 280\n\n\n210        The Model Act does not contain a reference to the prohibition of caste-based\n\ndiscrimination. This is concerning because the Act empowers the officer-in-charge of\n\nthe prison to “utilize the services of prisoners” for “administration and management of\n\nthe prisons”. 281 Further, disabling from labour and continuously refusing to work is a\n\nprison offence. 282 The officer-in-charge should not be given the liberty to discriminate\n\nagainst any group of prisoners on the basis of caste. While the Model Prison Manual\n\n2016 refers to the prohibition of caste discrimination in prisons in several provisions,\n\nthe Model Act of 2023 has completely avoided any such mention. A provision to that\n\neffect should be inserted in the Model Act. It should ban segregation or division of work\n\nbased on caste.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_309\">\n211        The definition of “Habitual Offender” under <a href=\"/doc/26818820/\" id=\"a_392\">Section 2(12)</a> is also problematic. It\n\nstates that, “Habitual Offender means a prisoner who is committed to prison repeatedly\n\nfor a crime”. The phrase “committed to prison repeatedly” is vague and over-broad. It\n\ncan be used to declare anyone as a habitual offender, even if they have not been\n\nconvicted for a crime. The Model Act also provides that “habitual offenders” may be\n\nhoused in a high security prison. 283 In addition to the category of habitual offender, the\n\nAct creates a category of “recidivist”, which means “any prisoner who is convicted for\n\n\n\n\n280 Ibid\n281 Section 60, Model Prisons and Correctional Services Act, 2023\n282 Ibid, Section 39(v) and (vi)\n283 Section 2(15), Model Prisons and Correctional Services Act, 2023\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_239\">                                                                                        133</span>\n\f                                                                             PART XVII\n\n\n a crime more than once”. 284 “Habitual/recidivist prisoners” may be classified separately\n\n and segregated in prisons. 285\n\n\n 212      Chapter IX of the Model Act, dealing with “Protection of Society from Criminal\n\n Activities of High-Risk Prisoners, Habitual Offenders and Hardened Criminals”, also\n\n seems to be over-broad. <a href=\"/doc/75869117/\" id=\"a_393\">Section 27(1)</a> states that the society needs to be protected\n\n from “habitual offenders, along with high-risk prisoners, and hardened criminals. The\n\n said category is prohibited for “parole, furlough, or any kind of prison leave in the\n\n normal course”. 286 <a href=\"/doc/17412906/\" id=\"a_394\">The Act</a> provides that “the release of a high-risk/hardened/habitual\n\n offender convict on completion of sentence or an under-trial on bail or an inmate\n\n released temporarily on parole/furlough, etc. shall be informed to the Superintendent\n\n of Police of the concerned district, who shall keep a watch on the activities of such\n\n prisoners”. 287 This provision gives wide powers to the police, which may be misused.\n\n\nXVII.     The Continued Targeting of Denotified Tribes\n\n\n 213      The impugned provisions are also an instance of existing discrimination and\n\n targeting of the members of the Denotified Tribes. In a previous section of this\n\n judgment, we held that the impugned provisions discriminate against the Denotified\n\n Tribes. Dr. Muralidhar argued that the classification of “habitual offender” needs to be\n\n completely done away with. At this stage, it is necessary to discuss how the\n\n classification of “habitual offender” was initially conceptualized.\n\n 214      The classification of “habitual offender” emerged prior to the repeal of the\n\n <a href=\"/doc/17412906/\" id=\"a_395\">Criminal Tribes Act</a>. Several Provinces had enacted their habitual offender laws.

Contrary to the Criminal Tribes Act or the <a href=\"/doc/32339738/\" id=\"a_404\">Madras Restriction of Habitual\n\nOffenders Act, the Bombay Habitual Offenders Restriction Act, 1947</a> granted power to\n\nonly competent courts to pass restrictive orders after necessary legal proceedings.\n\nUnder the Madras law, such orders could be passed by government or officers\n\nauthorised by them. 290\n\n215      The Rajasthan Habitual Criminals (Registration and Regulation) Act, 1950\n\ndefined “habitual criminal” as “a person who being a member of a notified tribe” who\n\nwithin the prescribed period, has not “been declared by an order in writing of the\n\nDistrict Magistrate as no longer a habitual criminal”. Further, it included “a person, who\n\nwhether he was a member of a notified tribe or not, has within any period of ten years\n\nfollowing the aforesaid date, been convicted not less than thrice of any of the offences\n\nspecified”. 291 The Rajasthan Act gave “too much discretion” to the District\n\nMagistrate. 292 A biased officer may never declare any members of a Criminal Tribe as\n\n“no longer habitual criminals” even if they may not have any convictions at all. 293 The\n\nRajasthan Act was “hardly any improvement” from the <a href=\"/doc/17412906/\" id=\"a_405\">Criminal Tribes Act</a>. 294\n\n\n\n\n288          The       Criminal        Tribes          Enquiry        Committee   Report      (1949-50),\nhttps://ia802807.us.archive.org/11/items/dli.csl.944/944.pdf, p. 92\n289 Ibid, p. 93\n290 Ibid, p. 94\n291 Ibid\n292 Ibid\n293 Ibid\n294 Ibid, p. 95\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_241\">                                                                                                   135</span>\n\f                                                                                                  PART XVII\n\n216        The Criminal Tribes Enquiry Committee, while recommending the repeal of the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/17412906/\" id=\"a_406\">Criminal Tribes Act</a>, suggested enactment of a central habitual offender legislation.\n\nHowever, it stated that “a person should not be branded as a habitual offender merely\n\non grounds of suspicion”. 295 In his oral evidence before the Committee, a deputy\n\ninspector general rank officer from Bihar stated, “In some of the democratic countries\n\nof the world, the surveillance kept over even hardened criminals is not done in the way\n\nin which we do it India, and a time should come when no criminal should know that he\n\nis really being followed or pursued”. 296 The Committee recommended that “a person\n\nwho has been convicted twice for any non-bailable offences under Chapters XII, XVI\n\nand XVII of the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_407\">Indian Penal Code</a> including an order under <a href=\"/doc/841023/\" id=\"a_408\">section 118</a> of the Criminal\n\nProcedure Code should be considered a habitual offender for the purposes of the new\n\nAct”. 297 The Committee was of the view that provisions similar to <a href=\"/doc/48099202/\" id=\"a_409\">sections 23</a>, <a href=\"/doc/99972150/\" id=\"a_410\">24</a>, <a href=\"/doc/114353454/\" id=\"a_411\">26</a>,\n\nand <a href=\"/doc/75869117/\" id=\"a_412\">27</a> of the Criminal Tribes Act should not be included in the new Act. 298\n\n217        After the repeal of the <a href=\"/doc/17412906/\" id=\"a_413\">Criminal Tribes Act</a>, several States enacted new habitual\n\noffender laws in their jurisdictions.

The Future of Substantive Equality &amp; Institutional Discrimination\n\n228      What does the future hold for India? Dr Ambedkar had expressed this concern\n\nin his last address to the Constituent Assembly. The concern holds true even today.\n\nMore than 75 years since independence, we have not been able to eradicate the evil\n\nof caste discrimination. We need to have a national vision for justice and equality,\n\nwhich involves all citizens. As Jamal Greene noted:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_139\">                      “There is also such a thing as rights. Those individual\n                      people and families have hopes and fears that\n                      matter but that conflict with the fears and hopes of\n                      their fellow human beings. Their aspirations and\n                      worries don’t depend on what Framers believed, or\n                      how Madison phrased the Bill of Rights, or whether\n                      some judicial opinion says “strict scrutiny” applies to\n                      a case. They depend on what people’s expectations\n                      are, how they are treated by others, and why. We are\n                      bound to experience the rights we have differently\n                      than anyone else does—this is what makes them\n                      ours. The central challenge for any system of justice\n                      has always been that we dream alone but we live\n                      together.” 313\n\n\n\n\n311 Section 54\n312 Section 56\n313 Jamal Greene, How Rights Went Wrong: Why Our Obsession with Rights is Tearing America Apart, Mariner\n\nBooks, 2022, p. 248\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_255\">                                                                                                   144</span>\n\f                                                                                             PART XIX\n\nTherefore, we need real and quick steps to identify the instances of existing inequalities\n\nand injustices in our society. Words, without action, would mean nothing for the\n\noppressed. As Paulo Freire noted in the “Pedagogy of the Oppressed”:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_140\">                        “The oppressor is solidary with the oppressed only\n                        when he stops regarding the oppressed as an\n                        abstract category and sees them as persons who\n                        have been unjustly dealt with, deprived of their voice,\n                        cheated in the sale of their labor— when he stops\n                        making pious, sentimental, and individualistic\n                        gestures and risks an act of love. True solidarity is\n                        found only in the plenitude of this act of love, in its\n                        existentiality, in the praxis. To affirm that men and\n                        women are persons and as persons should be free,\n                        and yet to do nothing tangible to make this\n                        affirmative a reality, is a farce.” 314\n\nWe need a compassionate approach, as Alan Paton had described:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_141\">                        “It is my own belief that the only power which can\n                        resist the power of fear is the power of love. It’s a\n                        weak thing and a tender thing; men despise and\n                        deride it.
