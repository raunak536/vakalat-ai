In fact, in the order\n                                          dated 24.04.24, this court has noted that the applicant had\n                                          concealed from the court regarding the charge of destruction of\n                                          evidence against him. Be that as it may, instead of getting swayed\n                                          away by the averments of the applicant, this court considered it\n                                          proper to hear the complainant/victim on this application. The\n                                          complainant has been heard specifically in view of the fact that the\n                                          information sought by the applicant has the potential of infringing\n                                          with the right of privacy of the complainant.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">                                                  &quot;The scope of an application U/s 91 <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_15\">Cr.P.C</a>. has been\n                                          discussed in multiple cases by the constitutional courts. It is fairly\n                                          settled that ordinarily, the court has to proceed on the basis of the\n                                          material produced with the chargesheet. However, if there is any\n                                          material of a sterling quality, the same may be looked into even at\n                                          the stage of charge.

However, the mere fact that calls were exchanged\n                                          between the parties does not establish the nature of a relationship\n                                          between the parties. Even if, it is believed on face value that the\n                                          accused and the complainant were in a relationship, the same does\n                                          not make it desirable that the call detail records are preserved.\n                                          For, the relationship could have gone wrong from January 2023\n                                          onwards and the complainant may have withdrawn her\n                                          willingness and consent from the relationship from that point\n                                          onwards. The nature of the offence is such that the victim may be\n                                          aggrieved at any given point of time and existence of past\n                                          conversations, without knowing the content of those\n                                          conversations, may have no bearing on the merits of the\n                                          allegations. In fact, the same may have the effect of stigmatizing\n                                          the victim. The call detail records of the relevant period have been\n                                          obtained by the IO and form part of the chargesheet. The other\n                                          information sought by the accused is only meant to indicate that the\n                                          parties were known to each other and the said fact has not been\n                                          denied even by the complainant. The fact of prior acquaintance is\n                                          of no relevance for deciding an allegation of stalking from a\n                                          particular point of time. The information sought is not necessary\n                                          for a fair outcome of the case and the test of necessity is not met.\n                                          Even on the aspect of the desirability, it may be noted that the\n                                          information is of such nature that it may subject the complainant to\n                                          unnecessary harassment and may even amount to a breach of her\n                                          privacy. This court is duty bound to strike a balance between the\n                                          right of the accused to a fair trial and the right of the complainant\n                                          to freely participate in the administration of justice without having\n                                          an apprehension of breach of privacy. A delicate balance of\n                                          constitutional rights is involved in the matter.

Learned senior counsel has argued that it is necessary to\n                                          preserve the aforesaid data and information, since it is the\n                                          contention of the accused, that such data and information would\n                                          prove the true nature of the relationship between the\n                                          complainant and the accused, which would be relevant for\n                                          examining the allegations being made by the complainant\n                                          against the accused in the subject FIR. It has been argued that\n                                          this gains significance, especially since the complainant had\n                                          initially denied any acquaintance with the accused; though she\n                                          has subsequently changed that stand;\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_21\">                                  11.5.

It may be observed that CDRs can reveal information such as\n                                          the number of times that calls are exchanged between parties,\n                                          the number of times one party calls the other and vice-versa,\n                                          the time of day when phone-calls are made or received, and the\n                                          duration of phone-calls exchanged between parties, etc., which\n                                          can be interpreted in the course of trial to examine the nature of\n                                          the engagement of parties with each other. To be clear, the\n                                          CDRs could turn-out to be elements of evidence, which are\n                                          either   inculpatory   or   exculpatory,   when    examined      in\n                                          conjunction with other evidence that may come on record.\n                                          Furthermore, the mere allegation that the accused had erased\n                                          data from his mobile phone while in police custody, in and of\n                                          itself, is no ground to have denied preservation of the data and\n                                          information requested by way of the application, especially in\n                                          view of complaint dated 16.05.2023 stated to have been filed\n                                          by the accused, alleging that the complainant‟s husband had\n                                          forcibly destroyed the data from his phone.

The learned APPs have in effect\n                                          argued, that the data and information sought by way of <a href=\"/doc/788840/\" id=\"a_40\">section\n                                          91</a> Cr.P.C. application would only be needed, if at all, at the\n                                          stage of defence evidence; but since the matter before the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_81\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_82\">Signed By:ANJALI KAUSHIK</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_83\">Signing Date:12.08.2025</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_84\">14:41:35                   CRL.M.C. 6745/2024                                                    Page 19 of 29</span>\n                                           learned Magistrate is at the stage of framing of charge, the\n                                          application under <a href=\"/doc/788840/\" id=\"a_41\">section 91</a> Cr.P.C. was premature; nor could\n                                          the learned Magistrate have considered the question of defence\n                                          evidence at this stage. Learned counsel appearing for the\n                                          complainant has also contended that disclosure of the data and\n                                          information sought by the accused would amount to a breach of\n                                          the complainant‟s privacy and should therefore not be\n                                          permitted.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_38\">                                  14.5. However, this court views the foregoing submissions in a\n                                          different light. In the opinion of this court, the rival\n                                          submissions show that at the very least, the data and\n                                          information sought to be preserved by the accused may be\n                                          required for purposes of the trial, even if at the stage of defence\n                                          evidence. The accused contends that the data and information\n                                          would be necessary for him to show the nature of the\n                                          relationship   between    him    and    the   complainant,     both\n                                          contemporaneously with the time of registration of the subject\n                                          FIR as well as in the past period. It is the contention of the\n                                          accused that the complainant engaged in a very close and\n                                          intimate relationship with him, which factor would be relevant\n                                          to construe and decide the veracity of the allegations that the\n                                          complainant is making against him. Whether or not this\n                                          contention has substance cannot be determined at this nascent\n                                          stage, and it cannot be said that the data and information sought\n                                          to be preserved is unnecessary or undesirable for purposes of a\n                                          fair trial.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_85\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_86\">Signed By:ANJALI KAUSHIK</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_87\">Signing Date:12.08.2025</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_88\">14:41:35                   CRL.M.C. 6745/2024                                                     Page 20 of 29</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_39\">                                   14.6. In the opinion of this court therefore, the data and information\n                                          sought fulfils the test of necessity under <a href=\"/doc/788840/\" id=\"a_42\">section 91</a> of the\n                                          Cr.P.C. It also appears obvious, and beyond doubt, that the data\n                                          and information in question are perishable, in the sense that\n                                          these are bound to be weeded-out or overwritten over a period\n                                          of time. It can therefore hardly be contended with any\n                                          seriousness, that it is not desirable to preserve that data and\n                                          information right-away. It would be a travesty of justice to tell\n                                          the accused, that we know that the data and information is\n                                          bound to disappear for-good if it is not preserved at this stage,\n                                          but since the proceedings are only at the stage of framing of\n                                          charge, so at this stage, you have no right to ask that the data\n                                          and information which will disappear subsequently, even be\n                                          preserved. If evidence, claimed to be exculpatory, is allowed to\n                                          dissipate in this manner, with the court being fully aware that\n                                          such evidence would become irretrievable subsequently, it\n                                          could prejudice a fair trial.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_40\">                                  14.7. The other objection strenuously raised on behalf of the\n                                          complainant is that the CDRs and other data and information\n                                          relating to the period prior to 01.01.2023 is irrelevant and of no\n                                          consequence. In the opinion of this court, that contention is too\n                                          broad to be accepted, since this court cannot lose sight of the\n                                          stand of the accused that the complainant and the accused were\n                                          in a relationship prior to that period, and to support that\n                                          submission, the accused has sought preservation of the CDRs\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_89\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_90\">Signed By:ANJALI KAUSHIK</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_91\">Signing Date:12.08.2025</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_92\">14:41:35                   CRL.M.C. 6745/2024                                                    Page 21 of 29</span>\n                                           and other data and information for the entire period from\n                                          01.04.2020 to 15.05.2023.

This court is constrained to note that in our process of criminal justice\n                                      dispensation, there is no formal system for an accused to collect\n                                      exculpatory evidence5, and an accused rarely has any effective means\n                                      of collecting such evidence. Since the means for an accused to collect\n                                      exculpatory evidence are woefully missing, investigating officers,\n                                      who invariably have an upper-hand at least at the stage of\n                                      investigation, fall into the temptation of keeping back evidence that\n                                      may be helpful to the defence. It is not uncommon for an investigating\n                                      agency to disclose only their side of the case, and regardless of the\n                                      repeated articulation by the Supreme Court of the true role of a public\n                                      prosecutor in <a href=\"/doc/385118/\" id=\"a_49\">Shiv Kumar vs. Hukam Chand</a> 6 and in <a href=\"/doc/57352980/\" id=\"a_50\">Manoj vs. State\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_99\">                           5</span>\n                                Noor Aga</a> vs. State of Punjab, (2008) 16 SCC 417, para 71\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_100\">                           6</span>\n                               (1999) 7 SCC 467, paras 13 and 14\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_101\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_102\">Signed By:ANJALI KAUSHIK</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_103\">Signing Date:12.08.2025</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_104\">14:41:35                   CRL.M.C. 6745/2024                                                          Page 23 of 29</span>\n                                      of M.P. 7 , the proclivity of the prosecuting agencies is to secure\n                                     conviction at any cost, which shatters the concept of a fair trial.</span></span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_44\">                           <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1041213\" id=\"span_105\">16.

In the present case, the accused contends that the communings\n                                     between the complainant and him from April 2020 upto May 2023 are\n                                     all relevant for examining the conduct, closeness and nature of their\n                                     engagement; and the allegations against him must be examined in the\n                                     context of the past relationship between the parties.

A crucial aspect that has been raised on behalf of the complainant is\n                                  that the I.O. has already collected the CDRs and other data and\n                                  information for the period 01.01.2023 to 16.05.2023; and that such\n                                  data and information for any period prior to the aforementioned\n                                  period is wholly irrelevant and unnecessary for the purposes of the\n                                  trial. On the other hand, the accused has contended that his\n                                  relationship with the complainant began sometime in April 2020; and\n                                  soured sometime before the filing of the subject FIR on 16.05.2023.\n                                  The accused contends that the incidents that are the basis of the\n                                  allegations levelled against him must not be viewed in isolation; and\n                                  that the alleged criminality of his actions is required to be appreciated\n                                  in the context of the past relationship between the parties. This court\n                                  would refrain from commenting on this contention, except to point\n                                  out that on the concept of res gestae as contained in <a href=\"/doc/1536853/\" id=\"a_55\">sections 6</a> and <a href=\"/doc/681440/\" id=\"a_56\">7</a>\n                                  of the Evidence Act read with <a href=\"/doc/482978/\" id=\"a_57\">section 8</a> of the Evidence Act, even the\n                                  past conduct of the parties may be relevant in relation to a fact in\n                                  issue.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_49\">                           21.    This court is accordingly of the view, that whether or not the CDRs\n                                  and other data and information for the period prior to 01.01.2023 is\n                                  relevant, cannot be prejudged at this stage. Admittedly, it is the\n                                  complainant‟s case that her acquaintance with the accused dates-back\n                                  to sometime in April 2020; therefore, in the opinion of this court, the\n                                  preservation of CDRs and other related data and information for the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_112\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_113\">Signed By:ANJALI KAUSHIK</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_114\">Signing Date:12.08.2025</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_115\">14:41:35                   CRL.M.C. 6745/2024                                                   Page 25 of 29</span>\n                                   period from 01.04.2020 to 15.05.2023, as contended by the accused,\n                                  is necessary and desirable.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_50\">                           22.    As for the apprehension that mere preservation of the CDRs, data and\n                                  information sought by the accused, would amount to breach of the\n                                  complainant‟s privacy or would stigmatize her, this court is of the\n                                  view that this submission requires a calibrated response. It may be\n                                  observed that this court is not blind to the concerns of the\n                                  complainant; however, in the opinion of this court, such concerns\n                                  cannot stand in the way of at least preserving what the accused claims\n                                  to be exculpatory evidence. As a measured approach, this court would\n                                  direct that insofar as the CDRs are concerned, in order to obviate\n                                  unnecessary exposure of the complainant‟s CDRs, only the CDRs of\n                                  the accused for the period from 01.04.2020 to 15.05.2023 shall be\n                                  preserved, which would be adequate to show the communications, if\n                                  any, between the parties for that period. As for the other\n                                  apprehensions expressed by the complainant, suffice it to say that\n                                  those can be adequately protected by holding in-camera proceedings\n                                  and adopting such other measures, at the appropriate stage, if so\n                                  warranted, as the learned trial court may consider proper.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_51\">                           23.    This court is at pains to reiterate, that all that is being sought by the\n                                  accused is that certain CDRs, data and information be preserved, so\n                                  that it is not irretrievably lost by the time the stage comes for the\n                                  accused to marshal defence evidence. Whether the evidence preserved\n                                  is relevant or admissible, or whether it should be taken on record,\n                                  considering the complainant‟s privacy and such other aspects, would\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_116\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_117\">Signed By:ANJALI KAUSHIK</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_118\">Signing Date:12.08.2025</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_119\">14:41:35                   CRL.M.C. 6745/2024                                                   Page 26 of 29</span>\n                                   be considered at the appropriate stage by the learned trial court.

Coming next to the argument that the application under <a href=\"/doc/788840/\" id=\"a_58\">section 91</a> of\n                                  the Cr.P.C. was premature, since the accused had no right to be heard\n                                  before the stage of framing of charge, in the opinion of this court, in\n                                  the day and age of electronic evidence, it would be a travesty of\n                                  justice if the court takes the view that it would not direct even\n                                  preservation of electronic evidence, until the time comes for recording\n                                  defence evidence. Since the court is aware that such evidence would\n                                  inevitably be erased or deleted within certain time frames, declining\n                                  to preserve such evidence would be a recipe for disaster of a fair trial.\n                                  This position can never be countenanced by the court.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_53\">                           25.    Insofar as the present proceedings are concerned, in any event, this\n                                  court would not hesitate to exercise its inherent powers under section\n                                  528 of the BNSS, to allow the preservation of the data and\n                                  information sought by the accused-petitioner in the present case, ex-\n                                  debito - justitiae.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_54\">                           26.
