Mr. Nitin Joshi, learned counsel on behalf of the petitioner\n                  submits that the „Post Confirmation Petition‟ is riddled with\n                  presumptions, conjectures and surmises, as while authorizing the\n                  impugned order dated 03.04.2024, no reports which formed the basis\n                  of disciplinary proceedings against the petitioner were produced\n                  barring the petitioner from using said reports for purpose of\n                  contradictions jeopardizing his interests and it must be accounted that\n                  law may prohibit revealing the identity of the secret informer but said\n                  information i.e. reduced into writing constituted a crucial piece of\n                  evidence and is mandatorily to be provided to the accused in order to\n                  enable him to prepare his defence.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_11\">                  10.       Moreover, the learned counsel for the petitioner argued that the\n                  RoE was initiated in absence of any legally admissible evidence and\n                  Respondent No.2 had failed that receipt of illegal gratification by the\n                  petitioner formed basis for ordering of RoE against the petitioner, as\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">Signed By:GUNN</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">Signing Date:01.09.2025</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">12:21:10            W.P.(C) 6148/2024                                              Page 6 of 35</span>\n                   no reports were ever brought to the notice of the petitioner nor was\n                  ever exhibited during trial. It was argued that the sole basis of\n                  incriminating the petitioner were 15 cropped video clips which were\n                  devoid of any certification primarily lacking two certificates under\n                  Section 65 B of IEA (i) In respect of transfer of secondary evidence\n                  from the DVR to the computer device and (ii) Transfer of secondary\n                  evidence from the computer device to the compact disk, with all\n                  material particulars as stated under Section 65B of IEA and as such it\n                  has been strenuously argued that these video clips could not have\n                  legally formed, the sole basis for reliance and further action against\n                  the petitioner.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_12\">                  11.       The learned Counsel for the petitioner has buttressed his\n                  submissions on the silence of the impugned order dated 03.04.2024 in\n                  regard to how „DEMAND‟ was proved when the person who\n                  allegedly paid the tainted money did not mention anything in relation\n                  to „DEMAND‟ and no report or complaint was produced and no\n                  person independently stood witness to any „DEMAND‟ by the\n                  petitioner.

Also, it was\n                  contended by the petitioner that 4 notes of Rs. 500/- did not constitute\n                  a bundle and it was not for the petitioner to prove that he himself had\n                  brought „Pedas‟ but the duty of the prosecution to prove that there was\n                  „DEMAND and consequent delivery/acceptance of „tainted money‟ by\n                  the petitioner in lieu of „clearance of bills‟ which has been presumed\n                  without anything in that regard being on record.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_14\">                  13.       It has been further submitted by the learned counsel that,\n                  impugned order dated 03.04.2024 reeks of ignorance as the sacrosanct\n                  right of the petitioner to obtain the entire footage of the video\n                  recordings to be used in his defence has been violated as only the\n                  cropped/edited clips were controverted during the trial. It has been\n                  also argued that although respondent was correct in its observation of\n                  the impugned order that it is not necessary under the scheme of\n                  <a href=\"/doc/324254/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 7</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1973776/\" id=\"a_16\">11</a> of the PC Act, 1988 to recover the tainted money or\n                  the apprehension of the accused in receiving the tainted money.\n                  However, according to the learned Counsel, the Respondent No. 2 has\n                  completely lost sight of what is necessary under the said sections i.e.\n                  „DEMAND‟ of said tainted money, which as per his submission has\n                  not been proved in any manner whatsoever and any complaint made\n                  against the petitioner has also not been proved „beyond reasonable\n                  doubt‟ and so is any secret information received against the petitioner.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_15\">                  14.       Furthermore, the „Defending Officer‟ of the petitioner was not\n                  available for a considerable time during the trial and the petitioner was\n                  represented by a Civil Counsel but Respondent No.2 overlooked the\n                  fact that as per principles of natural justice, the presence of a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">Signed By:GUNN</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">Signing Date:01.09.2025</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">12:21:10            W.P.(C) 6148/2024                                              Page 8 of 35</span>\n                   defending officer is warranted along with the Civil Counsel as Civil\n                  Counsels are not conversant with the day-to-day nuances of the\n                  military‟s functioning.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_16\">                  15.       Learned Counsel for the petitioner also submits that the\n                  rejection of the application seeking Pardon, Remission and\n                  Suspension of sentence of the petitioner is based on whimsical and\n                  presumptive lines of the learned Force Court and Respondent No.2\n                  has yet again chosen to attach importance to legally impermissible\n                  presumptions and assumptions and overlooked the material on record\n                  making the impugned disposal bad in the eyes of law. He has further\n                  submitted that the benefit of doubt shall not be given to the\n                  prosecution as the Apex Court has settled that even in Court Martial\n                  proceedings the prosecution has the duty to prove its case beyond\n                  reasonable doubt and the benefit of doubt, if any, accrues in favour of\n                  the accused.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_17\">                  16.       As per the submission of the Counsel for petitioner the\n                  essential conditions to constitute an offence under <a href=\"/doc/83604231/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 7 (a)</a> of the\n                  PC Act, 1988 requires the prosecution to prove beyond an iota of\n                  doubt that: (i) Petitioner was a public servant (ii) Obtainment of bribe\n                  (Demand) (iii) Details of bribe (Total tainted money) (iv) Promised\n                  improper &amp; dishonest performance of official duty. Now, the\n                  prosecution according to the petitioner has failed to prove the\n                  obtainment of bribe as the proof submitted by the respondent is a\n                  cropped video clip, without audio depicting conversation between the\n                  participants therein, with a defective certificate and the witness who\n                  allegedly paid the bribe money did not support the case of prosecution\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">Signed By:GUNN</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">Signing Date:01.09.2025</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">12:21:10            W.P.(C) 6148/2024                                            Page 9 of 35</span>\n                   and it lacked any independent witnesses. Also, no details regarding the\n                  alleged amount of bribe was provided before the petitioner was\n                  adjudicated as „Guilty‟ and no direct circumstantial evidence\n                  led/insisted to depict details of any alleged receipt of tainted money or\n                  assignment of work showing that the petitioner improperly and\n                  dishonestly performed his official duty.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_18\">                  17.       According to the learned Counsel for the petitioner, the\n                  ingredients to constitute an offence under <a href=\"/doc/1973776/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 11</a> of the PC Act,\n                  1988 were absent as no details regarding the obtainment of undue\n                  advantage of Rs. 10,000/- was provided before the petitioner was held\n                  „Guilty‟ and the sole star witness Sri. Mohitosh Das (PW-10) did not\n                  support the case of the prosecution at any stage and never stated that\n                  any undue advantage was received from the petitioner, and the pre-\n                  requisite („Proof of Demand‟) before analysing obtainment under\n                  <a href=\"/doc/1973776/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 11</a> was not satisfied, and no evidence was adduced which\n                  proved that the petitioner could have extended any benefit to Sri\n                  Mohitosh Das either himself or through anyone else which led to the\n                  conviction against the „Second Charge‟ by the Respondents.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_19\">                  18.

Further, the „Third charge‟ presumption could have\n                  been raised as there was absolutely no proof (direct/circumstantial) in\n                  respect of demand of bribe by the petitioner and the amount of Rs.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_44\">Signed By:GUNN</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">Signing Date:01.09.2025</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">12:21:10            W.P.(C) 6148/2024                                            Page 10 of 35</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_20\">                   2000/- was also presumed to be bribe without any substantial\n                  evidence.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_21\">                  19.       The learned Counsel for the petitioner also contended that the\n                  CCTV footage was used as sole basis of conviction and incarceration\n                  without it being authenticated by forensics as the video clippings were\n                  never sent for forensic analysis to prove its authenticity and said clips\n                  cannot form the basis of „Guilty‟. The clippings that are being relied\n                  upon were cut from the entire database of DVR which subsequently\n                  transferred to a computer wherefrom it was copied in a CD and\n                  produced before the Court which did not fulfil the requirement of\n                  „Proof beyond reasonable doubt‟. Even the certificate under Section\n                  65B of the IEA, 1872 was defective as the same did not contain all the\n                  material detail as encapsulated under Section 65B and did not even\n                  mention the name of the software used for cropping video clips and\n                  the format of the video clips do not certify that the same were un-\n                  editable leading to the submission of the petitioner that the same\n                  cannot form the sole basis for arriving at a hypothesis of guilt on part\n                  of the petitioner.

This Court\n                  is of the view that before embarking on the path of deciding the\n                  present writ petition, the scope and extent of interference of this Court\n                  under the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_41\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India in\n                  trials conducted by the GSFC as per <a href=\"/doc/181955/\" id=\"a_42\">BSF Act</a> and rules framed\n                  therein, must be understood, in order to appreciate the adversarial\n                  controversy raised in this petition between the parties concerned.\n                  Recently, this Bench had an occasion to examine the said scope &amp;\n                  extent in the case of &quot;Kiran Kumar v Union of India&quot; (Supra) vide\n                  judgment dated 25.07.2025. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"448127\" id=\"span_77\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1508554\" id=\"span_78\">This Court in the said judgment, relied on\n                  the Judgment of the Apex Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1508554/\" id=\"a_43\">„B.C.

Further,\n                  this Court cannot be oblivious to the fact that the entire procedure of a\n                  trial by GSFC is provided in the <a href=\"/doc/181955/\" id=\"a_46\">BSF Act</a> and the Rules made\n                  thereunder and since the provisions contained therein require that the\n                  findings reached, and the sentence passed, against an accused by a\n                  GSFC, is available for re-consideration by a competent authority for\n                  the purpose of pre-confirmation by the Director General, BSF in terms\n                  of <a href=\"/doc/1561411/\" id=\"a_47\">section 117(1)</a> of the BSF Act and Post-confirmation by the\n                  Ministry of Home Affairs under <a href=\"/doc/280298/\" id=\"a_48\">Section 117(2)</a> of the BSF Act, 1968.\n                  Therefore, there exists various layers of adjudication and it is only\n                  after these layers of confirmation of the findings and sentence are\n                  exhausted that the findings become final. Thus, this Court finds that\n                  the scope of judicial review in these kinds of cases, becomes severely\n                  restricted and can be exercised in exceptional cases only.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_31\">                  27.

Further, this Court, while exercising its power of judicial\n                  review in GSFC orders, does not sit on the findings of a GSFC or on\n                  the proceedings of a GSFC as an appellate authority and re-appreciate\n                  the findings for the purpose of determining if the evidence were\n                  sufficient for the conclusion reached. The findings of facts arrived by\n                  the GSFC are final in nature as it being the master of the relevance,\n                  admissibility or weight of the evidence lead during the Trial. Thus,\n                  this Court, while exercising its power of judicial review is reminded of\n                  its self-imposed limitation of restrictive intrusion only when the\n                  conclusion arrived by GSFC is based on no evidence. Further, neither\n                  the technical rules of <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_49\">Evidence Act</a> nor of proof of fact or evidence as\n                  defined therein, apply to these trials.

As, far as the present case is concerned, the learned Counsel for\n                  the Petitioner raised questions, regarding the military court‟s authority\n                  to convict an accused on the basis of probability and the requirements\n                  of the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_52\">Indian Evidence Act, 1872</a> as stated under <a href=\"/doc/530979/\" id=\"a_53\">Section 87</a> of BSF\n                  Act, which was mandatorily required to be adhered to in the present\n                  GSFC trial. This Court is of the view that no doubt, as per <a href=\"/doc/530979/\" id=\"a_54\">Section 87</a>\n                  of the BSF Act, 1968 the Security Force Courts are required to adhere\n                  to the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_55\">Indian Evidence Act, 1872</a> and said Act\n                  should apply to all proceedings before the Security Force Court.\n                  However, from a plain reading of <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_56\">Section 87</a> of the Act, it clearly\n                  transpires that general rules of evidence contained in the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_57\">Indian\n                  Evidence Act</a> shall, subject to the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/181955/\" id=\"a_58\">BSF Act</a>, apply to\n                  all proceedings before the GSFC. That means any provision in the\n                  <a href=\"/doc/181955/\" id=\"a_59\">BSF Act</a> laying down and providing any Rule of evidence would\n                  override the contrary provisions in the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_60\">Indian Evidence Act</a>. That\n                  apart, the <a href=\"/doc/181955/\" id=\"a_61\">BSF Act</a> is a special enactment providing for Constitution\n                  and regulation of an armed force of the Union for ensuring the\n                  security of the borders of India and other matters connected therewith\n                  and, therefore, the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/181955/\" id=\"a_62\">BSF Act</a> would prevail over the\n                  general provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_63\">Indian Evidence Act</a> wherever there is found\n                  any repugnancy between the general - <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_64\">Indian Evidence Act</a> and the\n                  Special - <a href=\"/doc/181955/\" id=\"a_65\">BSF Act, 1968</a>.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_34\">                  30.

This Court while examining the\n                  culpability of the petitioner relating to the second charge levelled\n                  against him for an offence under <a href=\"/doc/1973776/\" id=\"a_66\">Section 11</a> of the Prevention of\n                  Corruption Act, 1998 is concerned, finds that the GSFC has on the\n                  evidence brought on records a returned finding that the petitioner is a\n                  Public Servant and was present in the Administrative Block of\n                  Frontier HQ BSF South Bengal, Rajarhat, 24 Parganas (N), West\n                  Bengal on 23rd December, 2021 at 13:44 hrs. on the basis of\n                  testimony of Inspector/JE Subhas Chandra (PW-5), Constable (GD)\n                  Khaiarul Basar, (PW-7, Addl.), Shri Musale Avinash Dnyanoba (PW-\n                  9, Addl.) who produced Exhibit (Materials) M and N relating to video\n                  clips of the office of the petitioner, Shri Mohitosh Das (PW-10) and\n                  Shri Pradeep Verma, 2IC (PW-11).

We also consider the version of defence that the witness is\n                           less educated and cannot understand the English language and the\n                           witness could not understand his previous statements before\n                           signing. The Court, on this account, also consider the statements of\n                           PW-11 (Addl) and PW- 12 (Addl). As per PW 11(Addl), after\n                           recording the statements of the witnesses, the same were read over\n                           to the witnesses in the language they understood in presence of\n                           accused and signatures of accused, independent witness and\n                           Prosecution witness were obtained on each page of the statement\n                           of Prosecution witnesses. We also consider a certificate recorded\n                           under the statement of Sh Mohitosh Das(PW-10) which reads that\n                           the above statement question and answers have, been read over to\n                           the witness in the presence and hearing of accused in the language\n                           he understands better i.e, Hindi and he signs it as correct as well\n                           as the contention of defence that the word &#x27;explain&#x27; has not been\n                           mentioned in this certificate. We are of view that mere non-\n                           mentioning of the word &#x27;explain&#x27; in this certificate by Recording\n                           Officer would not wash out the statement of the witness when it\n                           was also read over to him in &#x27;Hindi&#x27; language by the RO and reject\n                           the contention of the defence in this regard. As per PW -12(Addl),\n                           who prepared SCOI in this case, he also explained the contents of\n                           his statement line by line and also read over the statement to him.\n                           PW-.12(Addl.) further gave evidence that Shri Mohitosh Das also\n                           himself read his statement line by line and put his signatures on the\n                           statement after having satisfied in presence of independent witness.\n                           As per PW-12(Addl), he completed the SCOI as per the procedure\n                           contained in <a href=\"/doc/181955/\" id=\"a_67\">BSF Act</a> and Rules made ·there under and there is no\n                           provision of endorsing by witness that he had been read over his\n                           statement and signing on finding it correct. It is also in evidence\n                           through the statement of PW-10 before us that he is class VI pass,\n                           however, has stated that he understands Hindi very well and also\n                           that he is in the profession of Contractor when he was 32 years of\n                           age and as of 2021, he has completed almost 26 years in the\n                           profession as contractor. This goes to &#x27;show that the witness is not\n                           so illiterate to have not understood the contents of his statement\n                           which were read over to him in the language he understood better\n                           i.e. Hindi and he signed it as correct in the presence and hearing of\n                           accused. Therefore, the contention of the defence challenging to\n                           authenticity of statement of PW-10 in SCOI and ROE does not hold\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_104\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_105\">Signed By:GUNN</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_106\">Signing Date:01.09.2025</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_107\">12:21:10            W.P.(C) 6148/2024                                                       Page 20 of 35</span>\n                            ground because of fact that the witness has deposed not only once\n                           but twice and at both the occasions, his version is consistent and\n                           corroborative, therefore, the version of PW-10 before us that he\n                           did not hand oven any money to the accused cannot be believed\n                           that too, when he is clearly seen in the clip number 6 to have given\n                           a bundle of currency Notes in the denomination of Rs 200 to\n                           accused which the Court find convincing and trustworthy on the\n                           reason that when humans have for extraneous reasons, like the\n                           case in hand, failed to be on the side of truth, the evidence\n                           collected by machines like video camera cannot be kept out of\n                           judicial scrutiny on specious reasons.

We\n                  find that the findings arrived by the GSFC cannot be faulted nor the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_116\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_117\">Signed By:GUNN</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_118\">Signing Date:01.09.2025</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_119\">12:21:10            W.P.(C) 6148/2024                                                       Page 23 of 35</span>\n                   same is based on surmises as has been wrongly contended by the\n                  petitioner. It was proved beyond reasonable doubt that the petitioner at\n                  the relevant point of time played a significant role in processing of\n                  bills of the electric works, which at that point of time was being\n                  carried by M/s Das Enterprises. The presence of the owner of M/s Das\n                  enterprises is proved from the video clips as well as the oral testimony\n                  of the witnesses. There is no escape from the fact that the petitioner\n                  and the owner of M/s Das Enterprises were in contact and the money\n                  has changed hands as visible from the video clips. The factum of\n                  money being handed over to the petitioner by the owner of M/s Das\n                  Enterprises, although was clearly visible in the video clips and was\n                  also accepted by him during the RoE was however purposefully\n                  denied during the GSFC trial, for which he was declared hostile. The\n                  said denial is significant in the background that during the RoE, he\n                  had accepted the handing over of the money, to the petitioner,\n                  although for a different reason and he had also admitted that the\n                  person in the video clip was the petitioner and it was he, who had\n                  handed over Rs. 10,000/- to the petitioner on 23rd December, 2021 at\n                  13:44 hours as visible in the video clippings. The grounds to resile\n                  from his statement recorded during RoE/SCOI on the ground of his\n                  ignorance has been adequately dealt with and negated by the GSFC. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"159728540\" id=\"span_120\">In\n                  <a href=\"/doc/159728540/\" id=\"a_75\">Union of India Vs Major</a>.

There is apparently no violation of principles of natural Justice,\n                  only for that the petitioner has submitted that the „Defending Officer‟\n                  of the Petitioner was not available for a considerable time during the\n                  trial and the petitioner was represented by a Civil Counsel, who may\n                  not be conversant with the nuances of the military‟s day to day\n                  functioning. However, this Court finds that the defending officer was\n                  present throughout the trial, except on few occasions, wherein the\n                  petitioner had no objections to the continuation of the proceedings.\n                  Further, it is seen from the proceedings that the petitioner was\n                  adequately represented by two Counsels of his choice, who has\n                  vigorously defended him and conducted cross-examination of the\n                  prosecution witnesses at length. Besides the fact that no such ground\n                  was raised during the Trial, the petitioner is unable to show as to how\n                  the proceedings or its outcome has been prejudiced with the transient\n                  absence of the defending officer from the trial. Further, the learned\n                  counsel for the petitioner submitted that the fundamental right to\n                  privacy of the accused has been withered and questions if the right to\n                  privacy not extend to the subject of the „Border Security Force‟. It is\n                  pertinent to note that the Supreme Court in the case of Justice K.S.\n                  Puttaswamy (Retd.) <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"96281061\" id=\"span_126\">v.

In regard to the first aspect, two infirmities are pointed out in\n                           the relevant orders authorising and confirming the interception in\n                           respect of specified telephone numbers. It is not shown by the\n                           prosecution that the Joint Director, Intelligence Bureau who\n                           authorised the interception, holds the rank of Joint Secretary to the\n                           Government of India.

It is to be noted that unlike the proviso to Section 45 of\n                           POTA, <a href=\"/doc/1445510/\" id=\"a_80\">Section 5(2)</a> of the Telegraph Act or Rule 419-A does not\n                           deal with any rule of evidence.

In that case, the Court\n                           clarified that a contemporaneous tape record of a relevant\n                           conversation is a relevant fact and is admissible as res gestae\n                           under <a href=\"/doc/681440/\" id=\"a_83\">Section 7</a> of the Evidence Act.

Further, this Court cannot be oblivious to the fact that the\n                  petitioner was a part of the Armed forces i.e. BSF and occupied a\n                  position which called for due care and precaution and in view of\n                  <a href=\"/doc/829916/\" id=\"a_85\">Article 33</a> of the Constitution of India, whereby it is for the parliament\n                  to determine as to what extent fundamental rights shall be applicable\n                  to the members of Armed Forces. Thus, the petitioner cannot claim\n                  parity with ordinary citizen, reliance in this regard is placed on the\n                  judgment of the Apex Court in <a href=\"/doc/681931/\" id=\"a_86\">Union of India &amp; Ors. v Ex.

The next contention of the learned Counsel for the petitioner is\n                  that the Supreme Court in its constitution bench judgement <a href=\"/doc/15799208/\" id=\"a_88\">Neeraj\n                  Dutta v. State (Govt. of NCT of Delhi) (Supra</a>) has categorically\n                  settled that „proof of demand‟ or „offer to pay tainted amount and\n                  receipt thereof‟ is essential before raising presumptions under <a href=\"/doc/1005555/\" id=\"a_89\">Section\n                  20</a> of Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988.

The said\n                           presumption has to be raised by the court as a legal presumption\n                           or a presumption in law. Of course, the said Criminal Appeal\n                           No.1669 of 2009 presumption is also subject to rebuttal. <a href=\"/doc/1005555/\" id=\"a_92\">Section 20</a>\n                           does not apply to <a href=\"/doc/178303/\" id=\"a_93\">Section 13(1)(d)</a>.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_49\">                           Also, in light of the instant matter there is ample documentary\n                  and circumstantial evidence on record that allows the Court to raise\n                  presumptions that the illegal gratification was for a purpose, and the\n                  order of the GSFC was well-reasoned.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_50\">                  39.      Moreover, this Court finds that the GSFC had the benefit of\n                  viewing video clip No. 06 produced before it in which the petitioner is\n                  seen receiving a bundle of currency notes of the denomination of Rs.\n                  200/- on 23.12.2021 at about 1344 hrs from Sh.

The petitioner\n                  received the bundle of those notes and immediately put the bundle in\n                  his left pocket. Although, Sh.

However, his previous statements\n                  given during RoE clearly indicate that on 23.12.2021, he visited the\n                  office of the petitioner and at about 13:45 hrs. handed over Rs.\n                  10,000/- in denomination notes of Rs. 200/- to the petitioner. The\n                  petitioner could not explain to the Court the reason for which he\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_153\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_154\">Signed By:GUNN</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_155\">Signing Date:01.09.2025</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_156\">12:21:10            W.P.(C) 6148/2024                                                       Page 29 of 35</span>\n                   accepted Rs. 10,000/- from the contractor with whom he was working\n                  in official capacity.

Further, this Court finds that the GSFC has found in the video\n                  clips that Inspector (JE) Subhash Chandra (PW-5) had handed over\n                  Rs. 2000/- to the petitioner at the office of the petitioner on 23rd\n                  December 2021 and the video clip in which the said transaction was\n                  recorded was found to be accurate. The said activity was clearly seen\n                  in the footage. In the video clip no. 13, Inspector (JE) Subhash\n                  Chandra (PW - 5) was clearly seen attending the office of the\n                  petitioner at about 1457 hrs. and taking out a bundle of currency notes\n                  (Rs. 500/-) and handing it over to the petitioner under the cover of\n                  papers. The petitioner is clearly seen accepting the bundle of notes and\n                  putting it in the right pocket of his trousers. The defence&#x27;s contention\n                  that the said money was for the „pedas‟ brought by the petitioner was\n                  not believed by the Court as the handing over of the notes was done in\n                  a clandestine manner. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"157711844\" id=\"span_157\">The Court was also of the view that the\n                  petitioner had accepted the said amount in lieu of work because after\n                  the assignment and completion of the work, the bills given by the\n                  firms were passed by the petitioner. Further, the petitioner could not\n                  rebut the presumption that the money in his possession was not a\n                  reward for improper discharge of public duty by him. Taking into\n                  consideration all the above, the Court was satisfied that the petitioner\n                  accepted the bribe for improper and dishonest discharge of official\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_158\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_159\">Signed By:GUNN</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_160\">Signing Date:01.09.2025</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_161\">12:21:10            W.P.(C) 6148/2024                                           Page 30 of 35</span>\n                   duty.

Of course, the said\n                           presumption is not an inviolable one, as the appellant could rebut\n                           it either through cross-examination of the witnesses cited against\n                           him or by adducing reliable evidence. But if the appellant fails to\n                           disprove the presumption the same would stick and then it can be\n                           held by the court that the prosecution has proved that the appellant\n                           received the said amount.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">                           22. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1967473\" id=\"span_162\">In <a href=\"/doc/1967473/\" id=\"a_95\">Raghubir Singh v.

The official witnesses including PW 8 have\n                           spoken to the prosecution version.

A contention was raised in the said\n                           case that in the absence of direct evidence to show that the police\n                           constable demanded or accepted bribery no presumption under\n                           <a href=\"/doc/731949/\" id=\"a_99\">Section 4</a> of the Act of 1947 could be drawn merely on the strength\n                           of recovery of the marked currency notes from the said police\n                           constable.

One of the illustrations to\n                           <a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_101\">Section 114</a> of the Evidence Act is that the court may presume that\n                           a person who is in possession of the stolen goods soon after the\n                           theft, is either the thief or has received the goods knowing them to\n                           be stolen, unless he can account for his possession. So too, in the\n                           facts and circumstances of the present case the court may presume\n                           that the accused who took out the currency notes from his pocket\n                           and flung them across the wall had obtained them from PW 3, who\n                           a few minutes earlier was shown to have been in possession of the\n                           notes. Once we arrive at the finding that the accused had obtained\n                           the money from PW 3, the presumption under <a href=\"/doc/180243/\" id=\"a_102\">Section 4(1)</a> of the\n                           Prevention of Corruption Act is immediately attracted. The\n                           presumption is of course rebuttable but in the present case there is\n                           no material to rebut the presumption.

The aforesaid observation is in consonance with the line of\n                           approach which we have adopted now.

Regarding the second limb of the contention advanced by\n                           Shri Nageshwara Rao, learned counsel for the appellant (that it\n                           was not gratification which the appellant has received), we think it\n                           is not necessary to deal with the matter in detail because in a\n                           recent decision rendered by us the said aspect has been dealt with\n                           at length.

Once the said premise is established the inference to\n                           be drawn is that the said gratification was accepted „as motive or\n                           reward‟ for doing or forbearing to do any official act. So, the word\n                           „gratification‟ need not be stretched to mean reward because\n                           reward is the outcome of the presumption which the court has to\n                           draw on the factual premise that there was payment of\n                           gratification. This will again be fortified by looking at the\n                           collocation of two expressions adjacent to each other like\n                           „gratification or any valuable thing‟. If acceptance of any valuable\n                           thing can help to draw the presumption that it was accepted as\n                           motive or reward for doing or forbearing to do an official act, the\n                           word „gratification‟ must be treated in the context to mean any\n                           payment for giving satisfaction to the public servant who received\n                           it.&quot;\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_170\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_171\">Signed By:GUNN</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_172\">Signing Date:01.09.2025</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_173\">12:21:10            W.P.(C) 6148/2024                                                       Page 32 of 35</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_55\">                            25.     We, therefore, agree with the finding of the trial court as\n                           well as the High Court that prosecution has proved that the\n                           appellant has received gratification from PW 1. In such a situation\n                           the Court is under a legal compulsion to draw the legal\n                           presumption that such gratification was accepted as a reward for\n                           doing the public duty. Of course, the appellant made a serious\n                           endeavour to rebut the said presumption through two modes. One\n                           is to make PW 1 and PW 2 speak to the version of the appellant\n                           and the other is by examining two witnesses on the defence side.\n                           True PW 1 and PW 2 obliged the appellant. The two defence\n                           witnesses gave evidence to the effect that the appellant was not\n                           present at the station on the date when the alleged demand was\n                           made by PW 1. But the trial court and the High Court have held\n                           their evidence unreliable and such a finding is supported by sound\n                           and formidable reasoning. The concurrent finding made by the two\n                           courts does not require any interference by this Court.&quot;\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_56\">                  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"172105947\" id=\"span_174\">41.       As far as the admissibility of the certificate under <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_105\">Section 65B</a>\n                  of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 is concerned, as per the evidence on\n                  record, in the „Pre-Confirmation Petition‟ that the digital evidence\n                  containing video clips was accepted under Section 65B, IEA, 1872 in\n                  accordance with the provisions of law. Moreover, it is also to be noted\n                  that the said petition mentions that there has been no infraction of law\n                  in admission of said digital evidence. The CD is to be treated as\n                  secondary evidence and as per the certificate under Section 65B of\n                  IEA it is certified that the computer of G branch bearing CPU No.\n                  INA581W572 was kept under lock and key in safe custody.\n                  Considering the failure of defence to prove to the Court that how was\n                  the said CD tampered with when the same was copied from the\n                  original source, leads the Court to believe that the said contention of\n                  the petitioner is devoid of any merit and is liable to be rejected. The\n                  said requirement satisfies the requirement of law as has been\n                  propounded by the Hon‟ble Apex Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/172105947/\" id=\"a_106\">Arjun\n                  Panditrao Khotkar v Kailash Kushanrao Gorantyal (Supra</a>).</span>\n</p>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_175\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_176\">Signed By:GUNN</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_177\">Signing Date:01.09.2025</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_178\">12:21:10            W.P.(C) 6148/2024                                                      Page 33 of 35</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_57\">                   42.      Further, this Court finds that although the petitioner had\n                  objected to the admission of digital evidence before the GSFC, but the\n                  submission of the petitioner was rejected as being inadmissible after\n                  due deliberation. Thereafter, the petitioner extensively cross-examined\n                  the witness who produced digital evidence containing recording of the\n                  events at the office of the petitioner on 23.12.2021. The petitioner was\n                  also provided a copy of the same digital evidence which was produced\n                  before the Court. The proceedings against the petitioner are not in any\n                  way prejudiced as it has been provided with the portions of the video\n                  footage which were produced before the Court and exhibited in the\n                  proceedings of the GSFC. Therefore, this Court does not find any\n                  force in the argument of the petitioner that the non-supply of entire\n                  footage to the petitioner of the DVR of the camera, installed in his\n                  office, has not caused prejudiced to the petitioner in any manner.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_58\">                  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"398491\" id=\"span_179\">43.      An analysis of the evidence on record clearly establishes that\n                  the offences for which the petitioner has been held guilty have been\n                  committed by the petitioner and the findings of this Court are based on\n                  the evidence available on record. The corruption committed by the\n                  petitioner in his official functions is contrary to            efficient\n                  administration and governance.
