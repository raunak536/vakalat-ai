This petition was verified on solemn affirmation. It was\nsupported by an affidavit of both the parties. In para 1 of his\naffidavit, the respondent no.1 husband clearly stated that the\npetition &quot;has been drafted by my counsel at my instructions. I have\nread and understood the contents thereof and hereby state that the\nsame are true and correct&quot;.

There is a further admission of fatherhood by the\nrespondent no.1 in para 15 of the petition when he unequivocally\ngives up all claims to custody, even to access to the child, and\nabandons responsibility for her maintenance and education which\nwas agreed to be borne by the mother alone. The parties clearly\nmentioned that the child would grow up exclusively in the &quot;custody\nof the mother&quot; endorsing the abandonment of custody rights by the\nother party.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_22\">8.     In the joint statement recorded of the appellant and the\nrespondent no.1 on the 1st of October 2014 by the Principal Judge\n(South-East), Family Courts, Saket, H-the respondent no.1 once\nagain declared that &quot;a child named Baby X was born on 6.10.2013\nat Lucknow and the child is in custody of the mother at Sultanpur&quot;.\nIn this statement on oath, H-the respondent no.1 again referred to\nthe agreement that the &quot;permanent custody of the minor child baby\nshall remain with the petitioner no.2/wife&quot;.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_23\">9.     The Family Court had raised an objection with regard to the\nmaintainability of the petition in the Family Court at Saket on\naccount of territorial jurisdiction. In view of this objection, on the\n22nd October, 2014, the parties agreed to withdraw the petition with\nopportunity to file a fresh petition before the court having\ncompetent jurisdiction. The Family Court recorded the statement\nof counsels for the parties and permitted the petition to be\nwithdrawn with liberty to file a fresh petition before the court of\ncompetent jurisdiction.\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016                             Page 5 of 95</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_24\"> 10.

In para 25, the parties\ndisclosed the filing of the previous petition being HMA\nNo.1099/2014 in the Saket Family Courts. The petition was again\nsupported by separate affidavits of the appellant as well as\nrespondent no.1.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\">       In para 13, the respondent no.1 had again declared that the\nparties have resolved their disputes and differences.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_26\">11.    It appears that thereafter, the respondent no.1 filed an\napplication for withdrawal of the above petition urging that there\nwere certain unwritten conditions also, agreed upon between the\nparties, and that he would continue with a criminal complaint\nwhich stood filed by him against the appellant and the respondent\nno.2 on grounds of adultery and that he was not prepared to\nwithdraw the said complaint. The respondent no.1 claimed that he\nhad agreed to file a petition by mutual consent purely in the interest\nof the child involved in the case and to bring to an end the\nrelationship of the parties which was non-existent on account of\ncertain acts attributed to the appellant.      In view thereof, the\nrespondent no.1 stated that he was withdrawing from the joint\npetition and prayed for its dismissal. As a result, on 9th January,\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016                             Page 6 of 95</span>\n 2015, the Principal Judge, Patiala House, Delhi dismissed the joint\npetition as withdrawn with liberty to the respondent no.1 to file a\nfresh petition for dissolution of marriage under appropriate\nprovisions of law.

In this petition, H-the\nrespondent no. 1 levelled allegations of adultery on the part of the\nappellant with a person who was impleaded as a respondent no.2\nand for the first time denied paternity of the child of the parties\nborn on 6th October, 2013.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_28\">13.    This petition was transferred by the Supreme Court of India\nfrom Lucknow to Delhi vide order dated 23rd February, 2015\npassed in Transfer Petition (Civil) No.1886/2014. The appellant\nfiled a detailed written statement contesting allegations of the\nappellant and vehemently denying the allegations of adultery.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_29\">14.    The appellant has set-up a case that she was subjected to\ngrave torture and abuse, both mental and physical, at the hands of\nthe respondent no.1; that the parties were cohabiting as husband\nand wife at their postings and that the respondent no.1 husband\nwould come and stay at Lucknow or she would go and stay with\nhim on leave or whenever visiting his place of posting. The\nappellant has asserted that she conceived from their wedlock and\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016                             Page 7 of 95</span>\n cohabitation and in February, 2013 told the respondent no.1 that\nshe was expecting their child.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_30\">       The respondent no.1 urges that this information was received\nfrom her only in April, 2013.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_31\">15.    On 6th of October 2013, the appellant gave birth to a girl\nchild at Lucknow.        On 18th October, 2013, a lunch and pooja\nceremony was organized at the house of the appellant&#x27;s parents\nwhich was attended by the parents of the respondent no.1 and large\nnumber of his guests. The priest who performed the pooja is stated\nto be an old acquaintance of the respondent no.1 and his parents\nfrom the time of his posting at Lakhimpur, Kheri District.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_32\">16.

Dharampal in the context of a medical examination are\ntopical and read thus :\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">   &quot;80. The matter may be considered from another angle. In\n   all such matrimonial cases where divorce is sought, say on\n   the ground of impotency, schizophrenia etc. normally\n   without there being medical examination, it would be\n   difficult to arrive at a conclusion as to whether the\n   allegation made by a spouse against the other spouse\n   seeking divorce on such a ground, is correct or not. In order\n   to substantiate such allegation, the petitioner would always\n   insist on medical examination. If the respondent avoids\n   such medical examination on the ground that it violates\n   his/her right to privacy or for that matter right to personal\n   liberty as enshrined under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_16\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of\n   India, then it may in most of such cases become impossible\n   to arrive at a conclusion. It may render the very grounds on\n   which divorce is permissible nugatory. Therefore, when\n   there is no right to privacy specifically conferred by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_17\">Article\n   21</a> of the Constitution of India and with the extensive\n   interpretation of the phrase &quot;personal liberty&quot; this right has\n   been read into <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_18\">Article 21</a>, it cannot be treated as an absolute\n   right. What is emphasized is that some limitations on this\n   right have to be imposed and particularly where two\n   competing interests clash. In matters of the aforesaid\n   nature where the legislature has conferred a right upon\n   his spouse to seek divorce on such grounds, it would be\n   the right of that spouse which comes in conflict with the\n   so-called right to privacy of the respondent. Thus the court\n   has to reconcile these competing interests by balancing\n   the interests involved.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">           xxx                    xxx                 xxx\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">   82.It is, however, axiomatic that a court shall not order a\n   roving inquiry. It must have sufficient materials before it\n   to enable it to exercise its discretion. Exercise of such\n   discretion would be subjected to the supervisory\n   jurisdiction of the High Court in terms of <a href=\"/doc/82577596/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 115</a> of the\n   Code of Civil Procedure and/or <a href=\"/doc/1331149/\" id=\"a_20\">Article 227</a> of the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016                             Page 13 of 95</span>\n    Constitution of India.

If despite an order passed by the court, a person refuses\n   to submit himself to such medical examination, a strong\n   case for drawing an adverse inference would be made out.\n   <a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 114</a> of the Indian Evidence Act also enables a court\n   to draw an adverse inference if the party does not produce\n   the relevant evidences in his power and possession.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">   84.

To sum up, our conclusions are:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">   1. A matrimonial court has the power to order a person to\n   undergo medical test.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">   2. Passing of such an order by the court would not be in\n   violation of the right to personal liberty under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_22\">Article 21</a> of\n   the Indian Constitution.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">   3. However, the court should exercise such a power if the\n   applicant has a strong prima facie case and there is\n   sufficient material before the court.

On the same aspect, we may usefully refer to the\npronouncement of the Supreme Court reported at (<a href=\"/doc/505918/\" id=\"a_23\">2005) 4 SCC\n449 Sh. Banarasi Dass v. Mrs. Teeku Datta</a>. This case arose in\nthe context of succession where a challenge was laid to the\npaternity of the petitioner who claimed to be the daughter of\ndeceased who was alleged to have died intestate leaving behind\nfive brothers. Originally, only four of the brothers were impleaded,\nout of which two passed away. The petition was filed only against\ntwo brothers and subsequently, the third brother was also\nimpleaded. One of the brothers objected to the grant of the\nsuccession certificate disputing Mrs. Teeku Datta&#x27;s claim of\npaternity. As both the objector&#x27;s brother and his wife were dead,\nhe sought a DNA examination of the petitioner with the DNA of\nthe other respondents. We note hereunder the consideration and\ndiscussion by the courts in paras 10, 11, 12 and 13 which read thus:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">       &quot;10.

This section is\n       based on the well-known maxim pater is est quem\n       nuptiae demonstrant (he is the father whom the\n       marriage indicates). The presumption of legitimacy is\n       this, that a child born of a married woman is deemed\n       to be legitimate, it throws on the person who is\n       interested in making out the illegitimacy, the whole\n       burden of proving it. The law presumes both that a\n       marriage ceremony is valid, and that every person is\n       legitimate. Marriage or filiation (parentage) may be\n       presumed, the law in general presuming against vice and\n       immorality.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">       11.

This rule of law based on the\n          dictates of justice has always made the courts\n          incline towards upholding the legitimacy of a child\n          unless the facts are so compulsive and clinching as\n          to necessarily warrant a finding that the child could\n          not at all have been begotten to the father and as\n          such a legitimation of the child would result in rank\n          injustice to the father. Courts have always desisted\n          from lightly or hastily rendering a verdict and that\n          too, on the basis of slender materials, which will\n          have the effect of branding a child as a bastard and\n          its mother an unchaste woman.&quot;</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_50\">       The view has been reiterated by this Court in many later\n       cases e.g. Amarjit Kaur v.Harbhajan Singh [(2003) 10\n       SCC 228].&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_51\">                            (Emphasis by us)\n\n       The presumption of legitimacy thus cannot be disturbed by\n&quot;slender&quot; materials under &quot;compulsive and clinching&quot; facts are\nbrought to shake the presumption and call for a DNA examination.\nProof of non-access was essential.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_52\">31.

In a matter where paternity of a child is in issue before\n      the court, the use of DNA test is an extremely delicate and\n      sensitive aspect. One view is that when modern science\n      gives the means of ascertaining the paternity of a child,\n      there should not be any hesitation to use those means\n      whenever the occasion requires. The other view is that the\n      court must be reluctant in the use of such scientific\n      advances and tools which result in invasion of right to\n      privacy of an individual and may not only be prejudicial to\n      the rights of the parties but may have devastating effect on\n      the child. Sometimes the result of such scientific test may\n      bastardise an innocent child even though his mother and her\n      spouse were living together during the time of conception.\n      In our view, when there is apparent conflict between the\n      right to privacy of a person not to submit himself forcibly\n      to medical examination and duty of the court to reach the\n      truth, the court must exercise its discretion only after\n      balancing the interests of the parties and on due\n      consideration whether for a just decision in the matter,\n      DNA test is eminently needed. DNA test in a matter\n      relating to paternity of a child should not be directed by\n      the court as a matter of course or in a routine manner,\n      whenever such a request is made. The court has to\n      consider diverse aspects including presumption under\n      <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 112</a> of the Evidence Act; pros and cons of such\n      order and the test of &quot;eminent need&quot; whether it is not\n      possible for the court to reach the truth without use of\n      such test.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_55\">                           (Emphasis supplied)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_56\">33.

When the legislature chose to employ the expression\n      that a certain fact &quot;shall be conclusive proof&quot; of another\n      fact, normally the parties are disabled from disrupting such\n      proof.

In other\n      words, the party who wants to dislodge the conclusiveness\n      has the burden to show a negative, not merely that he did\n      not have the opportunity to approach his wife but that she\n      too did not have the opportunity of approaching him\n      during the relevant time.

The raison d&#x27;être is\n   the legislative concern against illegitimatizing a child.

We may remember that <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 112</a> of the Evidence\n   Act was enacted at a time when the modern scientific\n   advancements with deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) as well as\n   ribonucleic acid (RNA) tests were not even in\n   contemplation of the legislature. The result of a genuine\n   DNA test is said to be scientifically accurate. But even\n   that is not enough to escape from the conclusiveness of\n   <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 112</a> of the Act e.g. if a husband and wife were\n   living together during the time of conception but the DNA\n   test revealed that the child was not born to the husband,\n   the conclusiveness in law would remain irrebuttable. This\n   may look hard from the point of view of the husband who\n   would be compelled to bear the fatherhood of a child of\n   which he may be innocent. But even in such a case the\n   law leans in favour of the innocent child from being\n   bastardised if his mother and her spouse were living\n   together during the time of conception. Hence the\n   question regarding the degree of proof of non-access for\n   rebutting the conclusiveness must be answered in the light\n   of what is meant by access or non-access as delineated\n   above.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_64\">   12. Whether the burden on the husband is as hard as the\n   prosecution to prove the guilt of the accused in a trial\n   deserves consideration in the above background. The\n   standard of proof of prosecution to prove the guilt beyond\n   any reasonable doubt belongs to criminal jurisprudence\n   whereas the test of preponderance of probabilities belongs\n   to civil cases. The reason for insisting on proof beyond\n   reasonable doubt in criminal cases is to guard against the\n   innocent being convicted and sent to jail if not to extreme\n   penalty of death. It would be too hard if that standard is\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016                             Page 21 of 95</span>\n       imported in a civil case for a husband to prove non-access\n      as the very concept of non-access is negative in nature.\n      But at the same time the test of preponderance of\n      probability is too light as that might expose many children\n      to the peril of being illegitimatized. If a court declares that\n      the husband is not the father of his wife&#x27;s child, without\n      tracing out its real father the fallout on the child is\n      ruinous apart from all the ignominy visiting his mother.\n      The bastardised child, when grows up would be socially\n      ostracised and can easily fall into wayward life. Hence, by\n      way of abundant caution and as a matter of public policy,\n      law cannot afford to allow such consequence befalling an\n      innocent child on the strength of a mere tilting of\n      probability. Its corollary is that the burden of the plaintiff\n      husband should be higher than the standard of\n      preponderance of probabilities. The standard of proof in\n      such cases must at least be of a degree in between the two\n      as to ensure that there was no possibility of the child\n      being conceived through the plaintiff husband.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_65\">                            (Emphasis supplied)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_66\">37.

The\n       presumption can only be rebutted by a strong, clear,\n       satisfying and conclusive evidence.

According to the clear interpretation of <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_52\">Section\n       112</a> of the Evidence Act, there is strong presumption\n       about the legitimacy of children born out of\n       continuation of the valid marriage.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">        xxx                       xxx                     xxx\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">       42. It is well-settled principle of law that odiosa et\n       inhonesta non sunt in lege praesumenda (nothing odious\n       or dishonourable will be presumed by the law). The law\n       presumes against vice and immorality. In a civilised\n       society it is imperative to presume the legitimacy of a\n       child born during continuation of a valid marriage and\n       whose parents had &quot;access&quot; to each other.

The present case raises issues which are really first\nprinciples and fundamentals for consideration of an application\nseeking DNA examination of a sample of a child wherein issue of\nhis or her paternity is raised. It is trite that the party seeking the\ntest, has to first and foremost make out a prima facie case that the\nalleged father had no access to the mother of the child at the time\nwhen the child could reasonably have been conceived.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_80\">45.    Before examining any other aspect, it becomes necessary to\nexamine what would be the meaning of &quot;access&quot; in the context of\nexamination of the paternity of the child.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_81\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1391831\" id=\"span_35\">46.    Earlier, the High Courts had held that &quot;access&quot; in an\nexamination of a paternity action means actual sexual intercourse\nbetween the parties. This controversy came to a rest by three Judge\nBench pronouncement of the Privy Council reported at <a href=\"/doc/1391831/\" id=\"a_56\">AIR 1934\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016                             Page 26 of 95</span>\n PC 49, Karapaya Servai v.

The factual matrix deemed sufficient by the Privy Council to\npresume legitimacy of birth sheds valuable light on the facts before\nus. The same reads thus :\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">      &quot;The materiality of these facts, however, is that in\n      December 1911, the parties were admittedly in touch with\n      each other, were residing at all events for a short period\n      in reasonable proximity, the wife being in the house of a\n      relative of the husband, and that there is nothing in the\n      agreement to suggest that she was unfaithful or that the\n      parties were on terms of personal hostility, though no\n      doubt the presence of the second wife would make an open\n      reconciliation difficult. If, therefore, the respondent could\n      have been begotton during this period his legitimacy was\n      undeniable.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_83\">                            (Emphasis by us)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_84\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"782122\" id=\"span_37\">48.      The above legal principle was approved by a three Judge\nBench of the Supreme Court in the decision reported at AIR 1954\nSC 176 : 1954 <a href=\"/doc/782122/\" id=\"a_57\">SCR 424 Chilukuri Venkateswarlu v.

In this case, a suit was filed by Chilukuri\nVenkateswarlu, an infant represented by his maternal uncle as his\nnext friend for recovery of possession, on partition of ½ share of\ncertain properties, on the allegation that they were joint family\nproperties of his father, the defendant nos. 1 and himself. The\nplaintiff was admittedly the son of defendant no.2, a legally\nwedded wife of defendant no.1.          The defence put forward by\ndefendant no.1 to the plaintiff&#x27;s claim, was a denial of his paternity.\nThe Supreme Court observed thus :</span>\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016                               Page 27 of 95</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">    &quot;On the admitted facts of the case, there could be no\n   question that the operation of <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_58\">Section 112</a> of the Indian\n   Evidence Act would be attracted and the plaintiff being\n   born during the continuance of a lawful wedlock between\n   his mother and his alleged father, a conclusive presumption\n   of legitimacy would arise, unless it was proved that the\n   parties to the marriage had no access to each other at any\n   time when he could have been begotten. The point for\n   determination, therefore, was whether on the evidence\n   adduced-in the case Defendant 1, upon whom the burden of\n   proving non-access admittedly lay, had succeeded in\n   discharging that burden. xxxx\n   It may be stated at the outset that the presumption which\n   <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_59\">Section 112</a> of the Indian Evidence Act contemplates is a\n   conclusive presumption of law which can be displaced\n   only by proof of the particular fact mentioned in the\n   section, namely, non-access between the parties to the\n   marriage at a time when according to the ordinary course\n   of nature the husband could have been the father of the\n   child. Access and non-access again connote, as has been\n   held by the Privy Council [ Vide Karapaya v.

On the\n   evidence, as it stands, we are clearly of opinion that\n   Defendant 1 did not succeed in proving that there was no\n   opportunity for intercourse between him and Defendant 2\n   at the time when the plaintiff was conceived. He rested his\n   whole case upon the allegation of unchastity of the\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016                           Page 28 of 95</span>\n       plaintiff&#x27;s mother and of the plaintiff being born as the\n      result of fornication.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">      While rejecting that story, the High Court, in our opinion,\n      erred in holding that there was no opportunity for access\n      between the parties at the material period, relying mainly\n      upon what the husband himself said and did much after the\n      estrangement of feelings took place between the parties, no\n      matter whatever that was due to.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_85\">                         (Emphasis supplied)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_86\">49.

By that date, the learned Family Court Judge also had the\npleadings of the parties as well as substantial evidence of the\nrespondent no.1 available before him which ought to have formed\npart of the &quot;prima facie&quot; consideration.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_64\">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016                            Page 35 of 95</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_116\"> VI.    Whether the case of non-access was specifically pleaded by\n       the respondent no.1\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_117\">60.    To justify the order for a DNA examination, before anything\nelse, the foremost requirement in the present case for establishing\nillegitimacy even prima facie, is a specific pleading of &quot;non-\naccess&quot;, that is to say a plea of no opportunity for cohabiting as\nhusband and wife and an opportunity of establishing marital\nrelations. It therefore, becomes necessary to scrutinize the petition\nfiled by the appellant to examine as to whether he had pleaded non-\naccess at the relevant time.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_118\">61.    Let us see what the respondent no.1 has to say about access\nto his wife in his divorce petition. In para 6 of the divorce petition,\nthe respondent no.1 has pointed out that the parties were posted at\ndifferent places; that there was change in her behaviour towards\nhim and that she started to avoid him without any rhyme or reasons\ndue to which the matrimonial life of the parties &quot;started to fall\nwithin the periphery of strained relationship and the cohabitation\nbetween the petitioner and respondent no.1 started to become a\nrare event&quot;.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_119\">       In para 7, respondent no.1 states that they resided as husband\nand wife together &quot;as a last occasion at Lucknow&quot;.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_120\">       In para 8, the respondent no.1 states that &quot;to save his\nmatrimonial life, he made all efforts from his side but the conduct\nof the respondent no.1 (wife) towards the petitioner was pathetic\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_65\">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016                              Page 36 of 95</span>\n during this period&quot;.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_121\">62.    In para 10, the respondent no.1 has set out his postings\nadmitting that from 2011, the parties were posted at different\nplaces. The respondent no.1 has moved from District Lakhimpuri,\nKheri District, U.P. in 2011; remained as District Magistrate,\nBareilly from 2011 to 8th June, 2014 and thereafter as District\nMagistrate, Aligarh when he filed the petition.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_122\">       However, he does admit that the appellant joined his\ncompany at his places of postings, though it was a &quot;rare entity&quot;.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_123\">       The respondent no.1 has attributed neglect to the appellant\nwife who, admittedly, was posted at different places.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_124\">63.    It is most important to note that in para 11, the husband has\nstated that from the &quot;period 2011 to December              2013&quot;, the\nappellant and the respondent no.1 &quot;hardly cohabited&quot;.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_125\">64.    At the same time, a backhanded statement is made that &quot;from\nthe start of the year 2013, even the access to cohabit was denied&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_54\">to him by the appellant. How is &quot;the start of the year 2013&quot; to be\ncomputed?       Clearly an indefinite position shows that the\nrespondent is not sure of his own case. In fact, it reflects that even\nin the start of the year 2013, the parties were cohabiting and having\na normal relationship.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_126\">65.    From the above pleadings, there can be no manner of doubt\nthat the respondent no.1 has not stated that he had no access to the\nappellant wife at the relevant time.      On the contrary, he has\nsubmitted that they were cohabiting from the period 2011 to\nDecember, 2013 albeit &quot;hardly&quot;.\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_66\">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016                             Page 37 of 95</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_127\"> 66.    It needs no elaborate detailing or consideration of pleadings\nthat &quot;rare entity&quot;, &quot;pathetic&quot;, &quot;hardly cohabited&quot;, &quot;hardly&quot;\ncannot be equated to the categorical assertion of no access which\nis required by law to displace the presumption under <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_85\">Section 112</a> of\nthe Indian Evidence Act. Consequently it was not even the\nhusband&#x27;s clear and unequivocal case in the divorce petition that he\nhad no access to his wife at the time when the child of the parties\ncould have been conceived.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_128\">67.    Baby &#x27;X&#x27; was born on 6th of October 2013. The relevant\nperiod of 280 days i.e. 9 months 7 days prior thereto would take us\nto start of the end of December, 2012/first week January, 2013\n(covering the &quot;start of the year 2013&quot; as well. The possible period\nof Baby &#x27;X&#x27; conception would be around 31st December, 2012.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_129\">       It is also the appellant&#x27;s case that the parties &quot;hardly\ncohabited&quot; from 2011 to December, 2013. &#x27;H&#x27; has thus admitted\n&quot;access&quot; at the relevant time.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_130\">VII. Whether there is non-traverse by the wife of the husband&#x27;s\n     pleadings, and thereby, deemed admission thereof?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_131\">68.    It is argued by Mr. V.K. Gupta, learned Senior Counsel for\nthe respondent no.1 that in her written statement/reply to the\npetition under <a href=\"/doc/1151479/\" id=\"a_86\">Section 13(1)(i)</a> of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955,\nthe appellant wife has not specifically denied the averments of the\nappellant. The submission is that there is no averment by her in\neither the reply or the counter claim that there was no denial of\naccess during the &quot;relevant time&quot; or that there was physical access\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_67\">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016                            Page 38 of 95</span>\n provided to the respondent no.1. In this regard, reference is made\nto the appellant wife&#x27;s response to paras 6, 8, 10, 11, 13, 15, 16 and\n36 of the divorce petition.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_132\">       It is submitted that therefore she is deemed to have admitted\nthe husband&#x27;s case. Mr. V.K. Gupta, ld. Senior Counsel for the\nrespondent no.1 has submitted that as a result, nothing further is to\nbe examined by the court so far as paternity of the child is\nconcerned.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_133\">69.    Placing reliance on Rules 3 to 5 of <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_87\">Order VIII of the Code of\nCivil Procedure</a>, Mr. V.K. Gupta, ld. Senior Counsel for the\nrespondent no.1 has vehemently urged that the denial by the\nappellant had to be specific; that every allegation in the petition\nwhich is not denied specifically or by necessary implication, has to\nbe taken to be admitted.

Mr. Gupta has placed reliance on para 11 of\nthe judicial pronouncement reported at AIR 1964 SC 538, Badat &amp;\nCo. Bombay v. East India Trading Co. which reads thus :\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_62\">       &quot;11. <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_89\">Order 7 of the Code of Civil Procedure</a> prescribes,\n       among others, that the plaintiff shall give in the plaint\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_72\">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016                             Page 43 of 95</span>\n        the facts constituting the cause of action and when it\n       arose, and the facts showing that the court has\n       jurisdiction. The object is to enable the defendant to\n       ascertain from the plaint the necessary facts so that he\n       may admit or deny them. Order 8 provides for the\n       filling of a written statement, the particulars to be\n       contained therein and the manner of doing so; Rules\n       3, 4 and 5 thereof are relevant to the present enquiry\n       and they reads:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_63\">              &quot;Order 8 Rule 3. It shall not be sufficient for a\n              defendant in his written statement to deny\n              generally the grounds alleged by the plaintiff, but\n              the defendant must deal specifically with each\n              allegation of fact of which he does not admit the\n              truth, except damages.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_64\">              Rule 4. Where a defendant denies an allegation of\n              fact in the plaint, he must not do so evasively, but\n              answer the point of substance. Thus if it is alleged\n              that he received a certain sum of money, it shall\n              not be sufficient to deny that he received that\n              particular amount, but he must deny that he\n              received that sum or any part thereof, or else set\n              out how much he received. And if an allegation is\n              made with diverse circumstances, it shall not be\n              sufficient to deny it along with those\n              circumstances.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_65\">              Rule 5. Every allegation of fact in the plaint, if\n              not denied specifically, or by necessary\n              implication or stated to be not admitted the\n              pleading of the defendant, shall be taken to be\n              admitted except as against a person under\n              disability.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_66\">       Provided that the court may in its discreation require\n       any fact so admitted to be proved otherwise than by\n       such admission.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_140\">       These three rules form an integrated code dealing with\n       the manner in which allegations of fact in the plaint\n       should be traversed and the legal consequences\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_73\">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016                              Page 44 of 95</span>\n        flowing from its non-compliance. The written\n       statement must deal specifically with each allegation of\n       fact in the plaint and when a defendant denies any such\n       fact, he must not do so evasively, but answer the point\n       of substance. If his denial of a fact is not specific but\n       evasive, the said fact shall be taken to be admitted. In\n       such an event, the admission itself being proof, no other\n       proof is necessary. The first para of Rule 5 is a\n       reproduction of Order 19, Rule 13 of the English rules\n       made under the Judicature Acts. But in mofussil Courts\n       in India, where pleadings were not precisely drawn, it\n       was found in practice that if they were strictly construed\n       in terms of the said provisions, grave injustice would be\n       done to parties with genuine claims. To do justice\n       between those parties, for which Courts are intended,\n       the rigor of Rule 5 has been modified by the\n       introduction of the proviso thereto. Under that proviso\n       the court may, in its discretion, require any fact so\n       admitted to be proved otherwise than by such\n       admission. In the matter of mofussil pleadings, Courts,\n       presumably replying upon the said proviso, tolerated\n       more laxity in the pleadings in the interest of justice.\n       But on the original side of the Bombay High Court, we\n       are told, the pleadings are drafted by trained lawyers\n       bestowing serious thought and with precision. In\n       construing such pleadings the proviso can be invoked\n       only in exceptional circumstances to prevent obvious\n       injustice to a party or to relieve him from the results of\n       an accidental slip or omission, but not to help a party\n       who designedly made vague denials and thereafter\n       sought to rely upon them for non-suiting the plaintiff.\n       The discretion under the proviso must be exercised by\n       a court having regard to the justice of a cause with\n       particular reference to the nature of the parties, the\n       standard of drafting obtaining in a locality, and the\n       traditions and conventions of a court wherein such\n       pleadings are filed. In this context the decision this\n       context the decision in Tildesley v. Harper [ (1878) LR\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_74\">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016                             Page 45 of 95</span>\n        7 Ch D 403] will be useful. There, in an action against a\n       lessee to set aside the lease granted under a power, the\n       statement of claim stated that the donee of the power\n       had received from the lessee a certain sum as a bribe,\n       and stated the circumstances; the statement of defence\n       denied that that sum had been given, and denied each\n       circumstance, but contained no general denial of a bribe\n       having been given. The court held, under rules\n       corresponding to the aforesaid rules <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_90\">of the Code of Civil\n       Procedure</a>, that the giving of the bribe was not\n       sufficiently denied and therefore it must be deemed to\n       have been admitted. Fry., J. posed the question thus:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_67\">       What is the point of substance in the allegations in the\n       statement of claim? and answered it as follows:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_68\">       &quot;The point of substance is undoubtedly that a bribe was\n       given by Anderson to Tildesley, and that point of\n       substance is nowhere met ... no fair and substantial\n       answer is, in my opinion, given to the allegation of\n       substance, namely, that there was a bribe. In my opinion\n       it is of the highest importance that this rule of pleading\n       should be adhered to strictly, and that the court should\n       require the defendant, when putting in his statement of\n       defence, and the plaintiff, when replying to the\n       allegations of the defendant, to state the point of\n       substance, and not to give formal denials of the\n       allegations contained in the previous pleadings without\n       stating the circumstances. As far as I am concerned, I\n       mean to give the fullest effect to that rule. I am\n       convinced that it is one of the highest benefit to suitors\n       in the court. xxx&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_141\">                          (Emphasis supplied)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_142\">74.

In this context, the Supreme Court making reference to\n<a href=\"/doc/1143279/\" id=\"a_92\">Section 58</a> of the Indian Evidence Act observed that a fact admitted\nneed not be proved. There can be no dispute at all with this well\nsettled legal proposition.

We extract hereunder the observations of\nthe Supreme Court in para 26 of this pronouncement which are\nrelied upon by the appellant :</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_69\">       &quot;26. In the written statement filed by the plaintiff under\n       <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_94\">Order 6, Rule 4 of the Code of Civil Procedure</a>, the\n       particulars and essential details of the 21 bales of cloth\n       were clearly mentioned in para 1(b). Further more,\n       counsel for the plaintiff gave a statement before the trial\n       court on September 5, 1952 where also all the essential\n       details regarding the 200 bales of cloth were given. In\n       the statement the counsel for the plaintiff admitted that\n       the plaintiff had received the sale proceeds of 179 bales\n       of cloth and that 21 bales of cloth remained unaccounted\n       for. In the evidence also the plaintiff has sought to prove\n       the very case set up in the plaint as also in the written\n       statement filed later under orders of the Court. We are\n       unable to see any substantial variation between the\n       pleadings of the plaintiff and the evidence led by him at\n       the trial. It is well settled that pleadings are loosely\n       drafted in the courts, and the courts should not\n       scrutinise the pleadings with such meticulous care so\n       as to result in genuine claims being defeated on trivial\n       grounds. In our opinion, the finding of the High Court\n       that there was wide gap between the pleadings and the\n       proof is not at all borne out from the record of the\n       present case.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_145\">                            (Emphasis by us)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_146\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"133024\" id=\"span_79\">77.

There is one more aspect of this matter which over burdened\ncourts overlook.

The same could arise in cases as the present\ninvolving birth of a child during the subsistence of a marriage or\nallegations of impotency or cases involving sexual offences\nincluding rape, incest, etc; allegations of impotency against a\nspouse in any matrimonial case amongst others.

These statements hopelessly failed to bring out the\ningredients of the offence. From this failure to bring out the bare\ningredients of the offence, one glaring factor had shone through\nwhich was noted in the following terms :\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_84\">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016                            Page 51 of 95</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_71\">        &quot;79.

The issue with regard to teaching of offences\n       regarding sexual assault and rape itself has been a\n       source of much discussion. I am informed that there are\n       instances of even legal educators being bashful and\n       embarrassed about teaching such subjects. Judges and\n       counsels are products of the legal education. The\n       multi-faceted problem and concerns noticed above are\n       not confined to ensuring gender justice in courts alone.\n       In this background, it is absolutely imperative that these\n       areas of law and the issues which have been raised\n       herein are taken up with all seriousness. Perhaps the\n       programme of continuing legal education needs to take a\n       look on these questions.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_154\">                           (Emphasis by us)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_155\">84.    We have made a detailed reference to the above for the sole\nreason that, when it comes to matters of deepest intimacy involved\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_85\">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016                             Page 52 of 95</span>\n in a sexual encounter even in a matter of pain (sexual violence),\nmost individuals as victims are hesitant to disclose the details or as\nprofessionals/experts (lawyers, police, judges) to discuss them in\npublic space. Hence, the nature of pleadings in cases involving\ndisclosure of intimate details of the sexual life of even partners of a\nmarriage.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_156\">85.    The same is apparent from the expressions used by the\nhusband in the present divorce petition as well. He has made bald\nstatements. Whereas, if specific detail was to be insisted upon, he\nwas required to state the exact dates and places when he had sought\nto engage in the sexual intimacies with his wife, dates and\nparticulars of which attempt or invitation or effort by him was\nspurned or refused by her. He does not do so. The failure to reflect\nin more detail on the parties intimate relationship is a reflection of\nhis natural embarrassment to describe close details of the parties\nintimate sexual life and of what must be the most private to them.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_157\">86.    We have extracted above the husband&#x27;s petition wherein also\nhe refers to the alleged extra marital relationship also in extremely\ngeneral terms. No specific details or instances are cited by him.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_158\">       Mr. Sethi, learned Senior Counsel would submit that the\nrespondent no.1 was himself not sure of his case and has set-up\ncontrary pleas in almost every paragraph of his divorce petition\nwith regard to access. These varied assertions of access (ranging\nfrom &quot;hardly&quot;) are spread all over the petition.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_159\">87.    Reading of the above would also show that as mandated by\nRule 4 of Order VIII, the answering party must answer &quot;point of\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_86\">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016                              Page 53 of 95</span>\n substance&quot; in the pleadings of the other side. In the case in hand,\nthe point of substance, as pressed in the divorce petition is whether\nthe appellant wife has committed adultery with the person cited as\nrespondent no.2 and whether the child born on 6 th October, 2013 is\na result of such act of adultery. Put more simply, the appellant\nwife has to deal with matters relating to intimate details of her\nmatrimonial life with the respondent no.1 husband and alleged\nextra marital affair with the respondent no.2.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_160\">88.    Mr. Sandeep Sethi, learned Senior Counsel for the appellant\nwife has submitted that the appellant has categorically stated in the\nwritten statement that the child to whom she had given birth on 6th\nOctober, 2013 was the respondent no.1 husband&#x27;s. It is submitted\nthat she has clearly stated that the allegations of the husband were\ndemeaning, defaming, vilifying and false allegations which\namounted to cruelty. She has categorically denied the adultery\nattributed to her and specifically adverted to &quot;his child&quot;. The\nsubmission is that the pleadings have to be read as a composite\nwhole and not as if each sentence was disjointed.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_161\">89.    The scrutiny of the above extract of the written statement\nwould show that the wife has categorically denied that she has\ncommitted any act of adultery, that she has no association at all\nwith the respondent no.2.       She has repeatedly asserted that\n&quot;incorrect and wrongfacts&quot;; &quot;figment of imagination of the\npetitioner&quot;; &quot;frivolous and fabricated ...ground of adultery&quot; (para\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_162\">4); that the child born on 6th of October 2013 is &quot;his own child&quot;,\n&quot;false and malicious...trying to allege that he is not the biological\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_87\">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016                              Page 54 of 95</span>\n father of his own child&quot; (para 6); &quot;false and wild allegations\nagainst his own child and wife&quot; (para 7); &quot;there is not an iota of\ntruth in the allegations made by the petitioner&quot; (para 8); &quot;ground of\nadultery taken by the petitioner should not only be rejected but also\nheavy costs&quot; (para 11).\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_163\">       In para 6 of the written statement, the anguish of the wife is\nexpressed when she has asserted how &quot;painful&quot; it was for her to\nmake the submissions. In para 11 of her written statement, the wife\nstates that &quot;perusal of the entire petition would show that the\npetitioner has only tried to repeat the false and fabricated facts\nrelated to this case in one way or other ...&quot;.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_164\">90.    In this background, can it be held that the appellant has\nfailed to answer the point of substance? The answer has to be in\nthe negative. The wife has effectively denied the substantive case\nof the husband and also generally denied each and every assertion\nmade by the husband each time he has repeated the allegation.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_165\">       The wife&#x27;s categorical denial of the allegation of adultery\nand insistence that the child was the biological child of the\nrespondent no.1 even at one place coupled with her general denials\nelsewhere in the written statement is sufficient denial in law, more\nso when she asserts pain in having to deal with such allegations in\nthe pleadings. There is no requirement in law for the wife to go on\nrepeating the same pleas. Clearly even if the appellant has so\ndeclared in one place, it was sufficient denial of the repetitive plea\nof the respondent no.1.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_88\">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016                             Page 55 of 95</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_166\"> VIII. Is the court bound to pass orders premised on admissions\n      of parties?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_167\">91.      Without expressing any opinion at this stage of the impact of\nthe wife&#x27;s pleadings on the bald statements by the husband, the\nproposition pressed by Mr. Gupta, learned senior counsel for the\nhusband that the wife has failed to deny the allegations of the\nhusband entitling him to the relief, can be tested from yet another\nangle.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_168\">92.      Even if the submissions of Mr. V.K. Gupta, learned Senior\nCounsel for the respondent no.1 that the respondent no.1- husband\nhad specifically asserted no access, that such fact as well as the fact\nthat the child born on 6th October, 2013 was not born from the\nwedlock and cohabitation of these two parties, was actually\nadmitted by the appellant wife, was the family court bound to\naccept this position as admitted and to pass an order based on such\nadmission alone? The position in law is clearly to the contrary.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_169\">93.      We find that the proviso to Rule 5 of Order VIII itself grants\ndiscretion to the court to &quot;require any fact so admitted to be proved\notherwise than by such admission&quot;.           A similar discretion is\nreserved to the court even in <a href=\"/doc/1143279/\" id=\"a_104\">Section 58</a> of the Indian Evidence\nAct, 1872 wherein the proviso confers such discretion on the court\nto require facts admitted to be proved &quot;otherwise than by such\nadmissions&quot;. The reason for such discretion, in a case like the\npresent one, is obvious.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_170\">94.      Let us assume a case where the husband&#x27;s pleadings qua\ndenial or lack of access to the wife to enable her to conceive their\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_89\">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016                              Page 56 of 95</span>\n child was specific. In her response/reply/written statement, instead\nof denying the husband&#x27;s plea of &quot;no access&quot;, the wife actually\nadmitted the assertions of the husband.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_171\">95.     The parties may have entered into a conspiracy to establish\nthat the child was not theirs for any malafide reasons, say for\ninstance, reasons of any tangible benefits arising out of inheritance;\nestate benefits; immigration and citizenship etc.; or to claim any\nbenefit provided by law. They could collude to deny paternity or\nrelationship. Say, where a government scheme operates to confer\nimmovable property benefit on individuals who are not\nrelated/siblings and it may be financially beneficial for establishing\nthat they are not related. In the case of contested matrimonial\nlitigation and child custody battles also, parties could falsely agree\nto paternity issues to ensure denial of custody to the husband.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_172\">96.    It needs no elaboration that it is the rights of the child which\nare affected by any order accepting such pleadings of the parents.\nSuch child is not before the court. In the face of the admissions,\nwas the court bound to return a finding that the child was not his?\nThe answer has to be an emphatic no.        Such finding of the court\ncould wreak havoc in the life of Baby &#x27;X&#x27; who is the innocent party\nnot before the court. It could adversely affect, even disentitle, such\nchild to rights in immoveable property.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_173\">       The court has therefore, to independently ascertain the\ncorrectness and genuineness of the allegation by one party,\nirrespective of the admission in the pleadings of the other in as\nmuch as it is the rights of the child involved.\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_90\">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016                              Page 57 of 95</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_174\"> 97.    In the present case, even if the wife&#x27;s pleadings could be\ntreated as an admission of the husband&#x27;s case, the court is bound to\nscrutinize the same with circumspection and require corroboration\nof the admission, if any, by independent evidence to premise a\ncourt order thereon.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_175\">98.    In any event, looked at from any angle, we find that even if it\ncould be held that the husband&#x27;s pleadings had not been traversed,\nwe have noted above that the respondent wife was called upon by\nthe husband not to traverse the case of complete non-access but of\n&quot;hardly cohabited&quot; between &quot;2011 to December, 2013&quot;.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_176\">99.    We find that in his cross-examination on the 24th of\nSeptember 2015, the respondent no.1 husband has admitted that\nduring official meetings, the appellant wife used to come to his\nresidence for lunch or breakfast. The husband has also admitted\nthat his mother used to go to stay with the appellant wife during her\nvisits to Pilibhit.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_177\">100. In the present case also, the parties though posted in different\nplaces, were coming together in reasonable proximity with\nopportunity of intercourse.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_178\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1039362\" id=\"span_91\">101. The petition itself mentions that the parties were posted at\ndifferent places.     Hence the statement by the husband that the\nparties from 2011 to December, 2013 &quot;hardly cohabited&quot; i.e.\nreduced opportunity relatable to official postings. But there is no\naverment by the husband that there was no opportunity at all or that\nthe wife had no access to him (Ref.: <a href=\"/doc/1039362/\" id=\"a_105\">Kamti Devi (Smt.) &amp; Anr. v.\nPoshi Ram</a>)</span>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_92\">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016                             Page 58 of 95</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_179\"> 102.   Prima facie, the respondent no.1 is unable to support a case\nof no access and instead of supporting the propounded allegations\nof adultery, the circumstances on record and the evidence of the\nrespondent no.1 also lean in favour of the presumption under\n<a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_106\">Section 112</a> of the Indian Evidence Act. Even if it could be held\nthat the wife has admitted such case, it could not be held that the\nwife had stated that the parties had no cohabitation as husband and\nwife during the relevant time. It is not possible to agree with the\nrespondent no.1 that there was deemed admission of &quot;no\ncohabitation&quot; or &quot;non-access&quot; by the wife.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_180\">IX.

We have extracted above para 7 of this\npetition, wherein the respondent no.1 had unequivocally and\nunconditionally declared that Baby &#x27;X&#x27; was born to them on 6th\nOctober, 2013 who was in custody of the mother at Sultanpur.

It is an admitted position that the divorce petitions which\nwere filed, were in compliance with the Rules. In both these\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_95\">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016                               Page 61 of 95</span>\n petitions, the husband had clearly stated that a child born on the 6 th\nOctober, 2013. Clearly, as per Rule 7(e), the parties had given\ndetails of the child &quot;of the marriage&quot;. This is a material admission\nby the husband, not once but twice, on affidavit on judicial record\nas well as on oath in his oral statement dated 1st of October, 2014 in\nHMA No.1099/2014.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_191\">110. When queried about the impact of this admission, Mr. V.K.\nGupta, learned senior counsel for the respondent no.1 has asserted\nthat it was not open for this court to go into this question and that\nthe same was irrelevant for the purposes of adjudicating on the\nprayer for a DNA examination of the child.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_192\">        Regrettably we are unable to agree with this submission.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_193\">111. The principles of law governing adjudication on an\napplication for DNA examination of a child are well settled. The\nrespondent no.1 - husband was bound to have made out a prima\nfacie case for grant of such a relief. Admissions of fact by a\nhusband are an important part of prima facie consideration of the\ncase.    In the face of the above admissions, which negate his\nchallenge to paternity, the respondent was bound to have rendered\nan explanation for the admissions. No such explanation has been\ntendered before the Family Court.        There is not a whit of an\nexplanation in the entire divorce petition, or in the application\nseeking the DNA examination. The same has been refused to be\ngiven before us.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_194\">112. These admissions on judicial record, clearly operate against\na finding of a prima facie case in favour of the husband.\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_96\">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016                              Page 62 of 95</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_195\"> X.     Conduct of the husband despite his allegations against his\n       wife - impact thereof\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_196\">113. In a case like the present once, conduct of the parties would\nthrow valuable light upon the prima facie consideration. We have\ndiscussed above that the husband is himself not sure of the case\nwhich he wants to make out. He himself has doubts about his plea\nof illegitimacy. This is amply borne out from his pleadings about\nhis conduct and emotions after learning about the pregnancy of the\nappellant.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_197\">114. The parties are at variance with regard to the date on which\nthe respondent no.1-husband learnt about the pregnancy. While the\nrespondent no.1 would want the court to believe that he learnt of\nthe same only in April, 2013, the appellant-wife has submitted that\nhe learnt of the same in February, 2013 after her medical\nexamination confirmed the same.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_198\">115. In para 13 of the divorce petition, the respondent no.1 has\nstated that this news &quot;brought a mix bag of emotions&quot; as &quot;on one\nhand he was happy to hear the news of a child coming in his life\nwhich any normal male would have cherished but on the other\nhand raised a strong level of suspicion in his intriguing mind about\nthe paternity of the child&quot;.     In para 14, the respondent no.1-\nhusband refers to &quot;such a whirlpool blowing in the mind of the\npetitioner(husband) about the paternity of the child which has\nraised a very strong doubt&quot;. Later in para 14, the husband has\nreferred to the fury of the wife when he doubted her character.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_199\">116. In para 15, reference is made to &quot;doubt&quot; or &quot;suspicion&quot; or\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_97\">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016                            Page 63 of 95</span>\n &quot;more strong level of suspicion&quot;. In para 17, the husband refers to\nremoval of his &quot;doubts&quot;.       If there had been no access or\ncohabitation, the husband would not have nursed merely a &quot;doubt&quot;\nbut would have had a firm belief that the child was not his. There\nwould be no question of &quot;a mix bag of emotions&quot; nor any occasion\nto be &quot;happy to hear the news of a child coming in his life&quot;. If he\nhad no access to his wife and had no relations with her, there would\nalso be no &quot;whirlpool&quot; in the husband&#x27;s mind about the paternity of\nthe child but the husband would be absolutely sure that the child\nwas not his.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_200\">117. Even in his examination-in-chief on affidavit dated 29th July,\n2015, the respondent no.1 husband has reiterated the above\npleadings.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_201\">118. These statements are to be tested against his admitted silence\nwith regard to his even nursing a suspicion through the entire\nperiod of the pregnancy of nine months (and thereafter) when the\nparties not even continued living as they were in the past, but also\ncelebrated the pregnancy of the appellant with all normal\nceremonies in the family of the respondent no.1-husband.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_202\">119. It is stated in her written statement (and admitted by the\nhusband in his evidence) that in March, 2013, the religious\nceremony relating to the pregnancy of the appellant was performed\nat Bareilly in which parents of both the parties had participated.\nHis parents had come from Bihar for this purpose while her parents\nhad joined them as well!\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_203\">120. One more material event inexplicably concealed by the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_98\">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016                           Page 64 of 95</span>\n husband is also brought on record of the case by the wife. It is on\nrecord that the birth of the child was celebrated by the parties and\ntheir families and a proper namkaran ceremony was hosted. The\nrespondent no.1 husband has claimed in his evidence that he came\nto know the name of the child &quot;Baby X&quot; in the namkaran sanskar\nceremony which was held in the October end or beginning of\nNovember, 2015 and that his parents, relatives and he himself had\nparticipated in the ceremony. The respondent no.1 had denied the\nsuggestion that he had invited 150 guests to attend the ceremony.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_204\">121. In his cross-examination, respondent no.1 was confronted\nwith seven photographs from the namkaran ceremony which have\nbeen exhibited on record as PW-1/R-3 to PW-1/R-9. It includes\nfive photographs which feature just the respondent no.1-husband\nand his wife (the appellant) with the child. In Ex.PW1/R-3 and\nEx.PW-1/R-5, featuring the appellant, respondent no.1 and the\nchild, the respondent no.1 husband appears extremely happy and is\nholding the child in his arms in an intimate gesture as part of a\nloving family. Ex.PW-1/R-4 appears to be a family photograph\nwhich includes the couple with their child in the arms of the\nhusband and immediate family members of the parties.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_205\">122. Ex.PW-1/R-6 and Ex.PW-1/R-7 feature the appellant with\ntwo of his friends (including the alleged adulterer).             The\nphotographs display his comfort and, in fact, his bearing reflects\nhappiness on the occasion. He has displayed complete comfort\nwith the appellant as well as the child and friendship with even the\nalleged adulterer.\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_99\">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016                            Page 65 of 95</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_206\"> 123. The photograph Ex.PW-1/R-9 shows the respondent no.1\nwith his mother and their Pandit performing the pooja (prayer)\nrelating to the namkaran ceremony. In his cross-examination, the\nrespondent no.1 has prevaricated suggesting that &quot;one person\nprobably&quot; looks like him!\n       None of these photographs displays any tension or anger or\nrevulsion as would be the normal reaction of any man, if, the\nsituation was as has been portrayed.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_207\">124. Let us note two more instances of the reaction of the\nrespondent no.1 to the arrival of the child and thereafter. In the\nhearing before us, on the 23rd of May 2016, a further affidavit was\nsought to be filed by the appellant along with enclosures. The\nsame was taken on the record of the present case with the consent\nof the respondent no.1 husband.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_208\">125. On 5th of July 2016, we were informed by Mr. V.K. Gupta,\nlearned Senior Counsel for the respondent no.1 - husband, that\nthough there was no objection to the affidavit being taken on\nrecord, the respondent no.1 was not filing any reply thereto for the\nreason that &quot;the facts stated in the affidavit are irrelevant for the\npurposes of the present appeal&quot; as well as &quot;for the purposes of\ndeciding the main divorce petition for the reason that it was\npremised on the allegations of adultery on the part of the\nappellant&quot;. So the appellant&#x27;s affidavit and its annexures remain\nundisputed before us.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_209\">126. For the purposes of the present appeal, we are only\nconcerned with the question as to whether the respondent no.1 had\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_100\">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016                            Page 66 of 95</span>\n established a strong prima facie case in consonance with the\nrequirements <a href=\"/doc/1039362/\" id=\"a_112\">laid down by</a> the Supreme Court for directing a DNA\nexamination of the child born on 6th October, 2013. The affidavit\nand enclosures stand taken on record with the consent of the\nhusband. We are within our jurisdiction to scrutinise the additional\naffidavit and enclosed documents from this perspective alone.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_210\">127. The first document so brought on record is the birth\ncertificate dated 22nd November, 2013 of the child issued by the\nLucknow Municipal Corporation which contains the name of the\nparents of the child. We find that the birth certificate reflects the\nfather&#x27;s name as &quot;H&quot; i.e. the respondent no.1 - husband and the\nappellant as the mother of the girl child born on 6th October, 2013.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_211\">128. The other document placed before us is the passbook issued\non 2nd November, 2013 of an Account bearing No.33423970043\nwhich was opened in the State Bank of India, Civil Lines, Near\nKacheri, Bareilly. This passbook is of a saving bank account of the\nchild which was opened by the respondent no.1 - husband while he\nwas posted as District Magistrate, Bareilly. In the account, against\nthe column for name of the child, as it was a minor account, after\nher name, it is mentioned &quot;UNG &#x27;H&#x27; IAS&quot;. We are informed that\nthis means that the child was &quot;under natural guardian &#x27;H&#x27; IAS&quot;.\nLegally the father of the child is recognised as the natural guardian.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_212\">129. As per the wife&#x27;s affidavit, during the namkaran ceremony\nof the child, cash gifts had been received, which totalled\n`1,61,000/-.   The respondent no.1 - husband had deposited this\namount in this saving bank account on the 2nd of November 2013.\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_101\">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016                             Page 67 of 95</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_213\"> Photographs of the parents were also furnished to the bank by the\nrespondent no.1 which includes his own photograph as the child&#x27;s\nfather.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_214\">130. Further subsequently, on the 20th of November 2013, the\nrespondent no.1 had got the name of the appellant - wife also\nadded as a joint guardian of the child to continuously make deposit\nfor the benefit of the child.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_215\">131. Prima facie, there is substance in the appellant&#x27;s contention\nthat each of these documents again contain admissions by the\nappellant of his having fathered the child born on 6th October,\n2013.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_216\">132. Considering the vehemence with which the respondent\nhusband is now agitating the plea of adultery, it is inconceivable\nthat the husband, an experienced bureaucrat of considerable\nexperience,    having     control   over   a   huge     administrative\nestablishment and paraphernalia, would not only tolerate the\ndeviations of an errant wife, support her through a pregnancy\n(allegedly extra marital) and also celebrate the same by performing\ncustomary puja upon a wife&#x27;s conception as well as the birth of the\nchild by a huge celebration. Or to permit his name to feature as\nsuch child&#x27;s birth certificate or to create and operate a bank account\nfor her!\n        These are behaviour which militates against a &quot;prima facie&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_85\">case in his favour on the plea that he was not the father of the child.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_217\">133. It is important to note that the respondent husband has not\neven remotely suggested any unnatural conduct on the part of his\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_102\">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016                              Page 68 of 95</span>\n wife during their marriage. He has made no allegation that she had\nspurned him or found him abhorrent. On the contrary, normal\ncivility and relations are reflected and the parties appear to have\nbeen meeting normally as husband and wife as well as\nprofessionally in their official residences and official commitments.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_218\">134. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1039362\" id=\"span_103\">In the discussion by the Supreme Court in para 10 of the\njudgment reported at AIR 2001 SC 2226:(<a href=\"/doc/1039362/\" id=\"a_113\">2001) 5 SCC 311, Kamti\nDevi (Smt.) &amp; Anr. v. Poshi Ram</a>, what is material is whether there\nwas a denial to the wife of access to the husband. No such material\nis on record.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_219\">Concealment and statement of wrong facts - whether impacts\nconsideration of prima facie case?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_220\">135. Mr. Sandeep Sethi, learned Senior Counsel for the appellant\nwife has drawn our attention to para 16 of the divorce petition.\nHere, in an effort to support a plea of non-access, the respondent\nno.1-husband has pleaded that &quot;the denial of access&quot; and &quot;cruel\nconduct&quot; of the wife towards him &quot;continued during the entire\nperiod of pregnancy also...&quot;.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_221\">136. In the written statement, the appellant-wife has stated that in\nMay, 2013, the respondent no.1-husband invited her to visit\nUdaipur where he had made all arrangements for stay etc. in\nUdaipur Vilas Palace Hotel which is a well-known wedding and\nhoneymoon destination and that, for the first time, all expenses\nwere borne by him. The appellant wife has also asserted that he\nhad arranged this Udaipur outing with the intention to persuade her\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_104\">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016                            Page 69 of 95</span>\n for a sex determination of the child to which she could not\nreconcile nor accept. The appellant-wife has further pleaded that\nfor the first time he spent money lavishly on this outing, that the\nparties came from Bareilly by road to Delhi and from Delhi, caught\na flight to Udaipur.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_222\">137. The fact that the parties went to Udaipur for holiday from 9 th\nMay, 2013 to 13th May, 2013 has not even been mentioned in the\ndivorce petition by the husband.           However, in his cross\nexamination on 24th September, 2015, this fact has been admitted\nby him. When questioned that the stay of Udaipur must have cost\nhim `40,000/- to `50,000/- per day and that he had paid over `2 to\n2.5 lakhs for the entire trip, the husband replied that he does not\nknow the tariff, nor does he recollect who had borne the expenses.\nThe appellant would suggest prevarication on his part, but this\naspect does not need to detain us here for a prima facie\nconsideration, except to the extent that the husband has concealed\nthis trip. The trip is conduct incompatible with that of a husband\nwhose wife is pregnant with an outsider&#x27;s child. It is urged that on\nthe contrary, the trip supports the appellant&#x27;s case of a normal\nrelationship between the parties.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_223\">       During the Udaipur visit, the appellant wife was already\naround three months into her pregnancy. Any reasonable person\nwho knew that the child was not his or that his wife was carrying\non an adulterous relationship would never vacation with her.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_224\">       The plea of the husband that he had no access to the wife\nduring the duration of the pregnancy is therefore, clearly false.\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_105\">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016                             Page 70 of 95</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_225\"> 138. The appellant-wife has further asserted that the parties\ncontinued to visit each other and that even thereafter, they both had\naccess to each other on all material time. It is the wife&#x27;s assertion\nthat on 15th August, 2013, he specifically came to stay with her at\nher place of posting so that she would not be alone on her birthday\nwhich happened to fall on 16th August, 2013.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_226\">139. Mr. Sandeep Sethi, learned Senior Counsel points out that\nthe entire case of the respondent no.1 of appellant wife having an\nadulterous relationship with the respondent no.2, hinges on his\nsolitary allegation that one of his friend namely, Shri Vikas Verma\nhad seen the respondents in &quot;intimate gesture&quot; in the company of\neach other on at least four to five occasions in public places. It is\nstated that &quot;Shri Vikas Verma has himself seen respondent nos.1\nand 2 at Hotel Manor, Faizabad, P.S. Chinhath, District Lucknow\nand their gestures fully corroborates..........the fact that respondent\nnos.1 and 2 behind back of the petitioner were having an\nextramarital relationship.....&quot;.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_227\">140. Mr. Sethi has drawn our attention to the record and pointed\nout that Shri Vikas Verma was examined as a witness on 16 th of\nOctober 2015 when he tendered his evidence by way of affidavit\nwhich was exhibited as Ex.PW2/A. This witness gave an address of\nLucknow as his address. However, in his cross-examination, this\nwitness revealed that his residential address was &quot;241/A, Raiganj,\nSouth Sarafa Katra, P.S. Rajgath, Gorakhpur&quot; and that he even has\na jewellery shop situated in Hindi Bazar, Gorakhpur. He also\ndisclosed that he had mentioned his father-in-law Shri Rajinder\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_106\">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016                              Page 71 of 95</span>\n Verma&#x27;s address of Lucknow in his affidavit of evidence. It is\nurged that this witness has clearly given a wrong address to falsely\njustify his presence at Lucknow to support the husband.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_228\">141. In his cross-examination further, Shri Vikas Verma has\ncompletely disclaimed that he had seen the appellant and the\nrespondent no.2 going inside Hotel Mannar! So far as the alleged\nintimacy is concerned, in his cross-examination on 16th October,\n2015.    Shri Verma baldly claimed that he had seen these two\npersons &quot;going inside Hotel Charan&quot;.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_229\">        This witness thus not only completely disclaimed the\ncontents of his own vague affidavit but also gave no specific date.\nIt lends support by the criticism that the respondent no.1 is\ntherefore, relying on bald and vague innuendo and suggestion in\nsupport of his plea of adultery, without any material in support.\nThe evidence of Shri Vikas Verma was on the record of the Family\nCourt on 28th January, 2016 for examining whether there was a\nprima facie case in favour of the husband when the application was\nconsidered and the impugned order passed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_230\">XI.

In\npara 4, the respondent no.1 referred to a DNA test purported to be\nconducted by the Central Forensic Science Laboratory, Directorate\nof Forensic Science Services, Ministry of Home Affairs,\nHyderabad, Andhra Pradesh under orders of the Additional Chief\nJudicial Magistrate, Lucknow in a criminal complaint filed by the\nrespondent no.1 under <a href=\"/doc/1833006/\" id=\"a_114\">Section 497</a> of the IPC.

The respondent husband has claimed that he first got a\nprivate DNA test conducted wherein a report dated 21st November,\n2013 was obtained, but the respondent husband has not placed\nreliance on the report, either before the Family Court or in the\npresent appeal.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_234\">145. Before we deal with the report, it is necessary to understand\nthe requirements of law for its acceptance.         In order to lend\nveracity to a DNA report, even prima facie, first and foremost, the\nperson relying on the same has to prove the sources of the samples;\ntheir confirmed identity, authenticity as well as purity thereof.\nAdditionally, the person relying on a scientific report has to make\nout the chain of custody of these samples and to support that it was\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_108\">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016                              Page 73 of 95</span>\n only such confirmed samples which were actually tested and that\nthe scientific report relates to only the claimed samples, without\nthere being any possibility of mistake or tampering or soiling\nthereof. Thus the first and foremost fact which had to be indicated\nwas that the report dated 23rd April, 2015 actually related to\nsamples extracted/obtained from the minor child; that it was such\nsample which had actually been sent to the test laboratory; that the\nlaboratory had conducted the test on that very sample vis-a-vis pure\nsample from the respondent husband and that the report was\nactually a result of DNA test conducted on the human samples\nobtained from the minor child and the respondent husband.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_235\">       We hasten to repeat here that we are at this stage again\nassessing the material which was before the learned Trial Judge at\nthe time of passing of the impugned order from a prima facie\naspect alone.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_236\">146. The respondent no.1&#x27;s evidence stood completed on 29th\nSeptember, 2015 and was before the Family Court when the\napplication was considered. In his cross-examination, the appellant\nwife has challenged every facet of the husband&#x27;s claim with regard\nto the DNA testing. From the very acquisition of the sample to the\nresult have been subjected to a cross-examination.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_237\">147. The respondent no.1 husband nowhere gives any particular\ndate on which the alleged sample i.e. the umbilical cord became\navailable to him, except to say that it was collected in the hospital.\nHe is unable to give definite size of the umbilical cord. So far as\nits preservation was concerned, the respondent no.1 has claimed\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_109\">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016                             Page 74 of 95</span>\n that he &quot;collected it through a piece of paper, wrapped the same in\nthe paper and put it in my pocket at that time. Thereafter, I put the\nsame in an air tight glass jar which I purchased later on, after\nleaving the hospital&quot;. The respondent no.1 claimed that &quot;umbilical\ncord was kept in the same glass jar duly wrapped in a paper for\nmore than 1½ years (one and a half years)&quot;. He states that he did\nnot inform his parents or in-laws about having taken the cord for\ntesting.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_238\">148. Medical texts advise that the umbilical cord falls off after 7\nto 10 days of birth, sometimes after 5 days. The respondent no.1\ndoes not explain that the mother and child remained admitted in\nhospital for such period.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_239\">149. Before us, additional material is pointed out from the trial\ncourt record which was called for. In order to prove the DNA test\nreport, the respondent no.1 examined on 4th March, 2016 as his\nwitness, Shri S. Sathyan, Senior Scientific Officer, Central\nForensic Science Laboratory, Hyderabad as PW-4. This witness\nrefers to a letter dated 25th February, 2015 received by the CFSL\nfrom the CMO, Lucknow (Ex.PW-4/1).            While requesting the\nDirector of the CFSL to get the DNA test done as per the court\norder, the CMO, Lucknow has referred to &quot;the blood sample of\n&quot;H&quot; and the so called umbilical cord of Baby .......&quot;. The Director\ndoes not confirm the source of the sample.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_240\">150. In his evidence also, PW-4 Shri Sathyan refers to the so\ncalled umbilical cord. In his cross-examination, the witness clearly\nstated that he was not sure as to whether the tested sample was that\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_110\">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016                            Page 75 of 95</span>\n of umbilical cord or not. Prima facie, there is thus, nothing at all to\nconnect the sample subjected to the testing, to the child concerned.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_241\">151. Mr. Sethi would urge that even if the husband had actually\ncollected the cord of the child, he has wrapped it in paper and\nstored it in an ordinary bottle acquired by him, not a sanitised\nsample bottle.     The submission is that for an effective testing\nsample had to be scientifically collected and preserved. It was so\nkept for a long period of one and half years, clearly exposed to\ncontinuous contamination. Ld. Senior Counsel would submit that\nno reliance can be placed on the DNA report premised on such\nsample for this reason as well. Unfortunately, the question as to\nwhether the alleged sample could have got contaminated, if\nmaintained or preserved in the manner as has been claimed by the\nrespondent no.1 husband, was disallowed. It is urged that even if\nthe sample was actually the child&#x27;s, there is doubt about its purity\nor effect of impurities on the testing.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_242\">152. Before us it is urged by Mr. Sandeep Sethi, learned Senior\nCounsel for the appellant wife, that the DNA report does not\nindicate that it relates to a sample of Baby &#x27;X&#x27;. Therefore,\nassuming without admitting that the report could be accepted as\nhaving been proved, it is certainly no proof of the fact that the\nlaboratory had conducted a test on a sample which actually\nbelonged to the child. At best, the DNA report relied upon by the\nrespondent husband had only suggested that a DNA test had been\nconducted on a sample of some tissue which did not match the\nrespondent no.1 husband. Simply put, the respondent - husband is\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_111\">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016                              Page 76 of 95</span>\n unable to connect the DNA report to the child in question.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_243\">153. In the face of the above, the DNA test report, prima facie\ndoes not support the husband&#x27;s claim that the report establishes that\nit actually relates to a sample of the child.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_244\">XII. In the facts of the present case, effect of the presumption\n     under Section 112 of the Indian Evidence Act\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_245\">154. The appellant before us has vehemently urged that in the\ninstant case, the presumption of legitimacy of the child is\nirrebuttable and conclusive of the fact. This is for the reason that\nthe respondent has failed to make out a case of non-access during\nthe relevant period when the child could have been conceived.\nThere is no dispute that the child was borne to the parties who were\nmarried to each other and had access to each other during the\nperiod of possible conception.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_246\">155. This principle stands reiterated by the Supreme Court in its\njudgment reported at AIR 2010 SC 2851, Bhabani Prasad Jena v.\nConvenor Secretary, Orissa State Commission for Women &amp; Anr.\nIn the following para 19 of the judgment, the Supreme Court\nextracted para 13 of (2005) 4 SCC 449, Banarasi Das v. Mrs.\nTeeku Datta &amp; Anr., and again cautioned that the DNA test was\nnot to be directed as a matter of routine and that only in deserving\ncases, such a direction should be given :\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_86\">   &quot;19. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"505918\" id=\"span_112\">In <a href=\"/doc/505918/\" id=\"a_115\">Banarsi Dass v.

The petitioner did not turn (sicaway) the\n       respondent from house on those occasions.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_89\">           24. That by her extravagant lifestyle the respondent\n       has incurred heavy debts. Since she has not disclosed\n       her present address to bank and has only given the\n       address of the petitioner, the men and collection agents\n       of different banks are frequently visiting the petitioner&#x27;s\n       house and harassing the petitioner.

Notice from\n       attorney firms for recovery of dues from the respondent\n       and her credit card statements showing heavy debts are\n       being sent to the petitioner&#x27;s address. The respondent\n       purchased one car in 2007 with the petitioner&#x27;s uncle,\n       Shri Subrata Roy Chowdhary, as the guarantor. The\n       respondent has failed to pay the instalments regularly.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_90\">           25. That the petitioner states that the respondent has\n       gone astray. She is leading a fast life and has lived in\n       extra-marital relationship with the said Mr Deven Shah,\n       a well-to-do person who too is a career oriented\n       gentleman and has given birth to a child as a result of\n       her cohabitation with Shri Deven Shah.

It appears from the narration of facts that the petitioner had\nnever lived with or shared a bed with her at all (or in any case since\n22-9-07).     The husband had made &quot;clear and categorical\nassertions&quot;. In paras 10, 11 and 12, the Supreme Court held as\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_117\">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016                              Page 79 of 95</span>\n follows :\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_91\">   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"139951018\" id=\"span_118\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"43471013\" id=\"span_119\">&quot;10.It is borne from the decisions rendered by this Court\n   in <a href=\"/doc/43471013/\" id=\"a_119\">Bhabani Prasad Jena[Bhabani Prasad Jena v.

The question that has to be answered in this case is in\n   respect of the alleged infidelity of the appellant wife. The\n   respondent husband has made clear and categorical\n   assertions in the petition filed by him under <a href=\"/doc/1284729/\" id=\"a_121\">Section 13</a> of\n   the Hindu Marriage Act, alleging infidelity. He has gone to\n   the extent of naming the person who was the father of the\n   male child born to the appellant wife. It is in the process of\n   substantiating his allegation of infidelity that the\n   respondent husband had made an application before the\n   Family Court for conducting a DNA test which would\n   establish whether or not he had fathered the male child born\n   to the appellant wife. The respondent feels that it is only\n   possible for him to substantiate the allegations levelled by\n   him (of the appellant wife&#x27;s infidelity) through a DNA test.\n   We agree with him. In our view, but for the DNA test, it\n   would be impossible for the respondent husband to\n   establish and confirm the assertions made in the pleadings.\n   We are therefore satisfied that the direction issued by the\n   High Court, as has been extracted hereinabove, was fully\n   justified. DNA testing is the most legitimate and\n   scientifically perfect means, which the husband could use,\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_120\">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016                             Page 80 of 95</span>\n    to establish his assertion of infidelity. This should\n   simultaneously be taken as the most authentic, rightful and\n   correct means also with the wife, for her to rebut the\n   assertions made by the respondent husband, and to establish\n   that she had not been unfaithful, adulterous or disloyal. If\n   the appellant wife is right, she shall be proved to be so.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_93\">   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"139951018\" id=\"span_121\">12. We would, however, while upholding the order passed\n   by the High Court, consider it just and appropriate to\n   record a caveat, giving the appellant wife liberty to comply\n   with or disregard the order passed by the High Court,\n   requiring the holding of the DNA test. In case, she accepts\n   the direction issued by the High Court, the DNA test will\n   determine conclusively the veracity of accusation levelled\n   by the respondent husband against her. In case, she declines\n   to comply with the direction issued by the High Court, the\n   allegation would be determined by the court concerned by\n   drawing a presumption of the nature contemplated in\n   <a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_122\">Section 114</a> of the Evidence Act, especially, in terms of\n   Illustration (h) thereof. <a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_123\">Section 114</a> as also Illustration (h<a href=\"/doc/139951018/\" id=\"a_124\">)<a href=\"/doc/139951018/\" id=\"a_125\">,\n   <a href=\"/doc/139951018/\" id=\"a_126\">referred to above</a></a></a>, are being extracted hereunder:</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_94\">         &quot;114.Court may presume existence of certain facts.--\n         The court may presume the existence of any fact\n         which it thinks likely to have happened, regard being\n         had to the common course of natural events, human\n         conduct and public and private business, in their\n         relation to the facts of the particular case.&quot;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_95\">   &quot;Illustration (h)--that if a man refuses to answer a question\n   which he is not compelled to answer by law, the answer, if\n   given, would be unfavourable to him;&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_251\">   This course has been adopted to preserve the right of\n   individual privacy to the extent possible.

Even though, as\n   already stated above, undoubtedly the issue of legitimacy\n   would also be incidentally involved.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_252\">                          (Emphasis supplied)\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_122\">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016                             Page 81 of 95</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_253\"> 158. We may note the submissions of Mr. V.K. Gupta, ld. Senior\nCounsel for the respondent insisting that the Supreme Court has\nauthoritatively laid down that the DNA test is the only manner of\nestablishing a plea of infidelity by one spouse against the other. It\nis urged that, therefore, in a case where a spouse alleges infidelity\non the part of his wife, medical examination has to be ordered. We\nare unable to agree with this submission. In paras 11 and 12, the\nSupreme Court is concerned with the facts of that particular case.\nThe Supreme Court has in fact in para 10 reiterated the same\ncaution as was mandated in prior judicial precedents.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_254\">159. The absolute submission and proposition pressed by Mr.\nGupta may be tested from another angle. What if there were no\nchild from the alleged infidelity or the extra marital affair of the\nwife? What about a case where the wife alleges infidelity against\nthe husband, with or without there being a child from such\nrelationship? The husband (or the wife) has to stand on his own\nfeet and establish the allegedly infidelity as per law.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_255\">       Accepting the proposition urged by Mr. Gupta would in\neffect, tantamount to laying down the principle that a spouse had to\nmerely make an allegation of infidelity (or mental illness or\nimpotency), without anything more, and courts would have to\nmandatorily direct scientific (or medical) examination.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_256\">160. It is a first principle of procedural law that a party alleging a\nfact, must prove it. Binding judicial precedents noted above have\nlaid down that a party must establish a strong prima facie case\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_123\">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016                              Page 82 of 95</span>\n before a court would make an order for the scientific (or medical)\nexamination, especially of the intrusive kind as a DNA\nexamination. The court cannot conduct a fishing or roving inquiry\nfor a party and a DNA test cannot be ordered to gather evidence on\nbehalf of a party who has made a bald allegation, without anything\nmore.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_257\">161. For this reason, even in Diwanwita Roy, while approving the\norder for the DNA test in the facts of the case, the court has clearly\ndeclared that the presumption under <a href=\"/doc/817818/\" id=\"a_128\">Section 112</a> of the Evidence\nAct would not be lightly disturbed. In para 10, the court has noted\nthat the order depends &quot;on the facts and circumstances of the case&quot;.\nIn para 11, the Supreme Court has noted &quot;the question to be\nanswered in this case&quot;.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_258\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"139951018\" id=\"span_124\">162.

Here, in the present case, the wife had pleaded that\n       the husband had access to her and, in fact, the child was\n       born in the said wedlock, but the husband had\n       specifically pleaded that after his wife left the\n       matrimonial home, she did not return and thereafter, he\n       had no access to her. The wife has admitted that she had\n       left the matrimonial home but again joined her husband.\n       Unfortunately, none of the courts below have given any\n       finding with regard to this plea of the husband that he\n       had or had not any access to his wife at the time when\n       the child could have been begotten.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_100\">       16.

It is an\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_133\">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016                            Page 86 of 95</span>\n admitted position that the defendant no.2 was married to a third\nperson which marriage was subsisting at the time of birth of the\nplaintiff.

The application seeking the DNA examination was filed not\nby the father - defendant no.1, but by the plaintiff and sought\ndirections to the defendant no.1 to furnish blood samples for a\nDNA comparison with his own samples to establish that the\ndefendant no.1 was his father.       The court had considered the\nplaintiff&#x27;s right to know his roots and noted that the application had\nbeen filed by an adult person who had moved the court for a\ndeclaration to determine his or her paternity.

Ensuring the Constitutional rights of the child\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_268\">169. Our consideration cannot end here. The inevitable victim of\nan order in a paternity challenge in matrimonial litigation is the\nchild who is not before the court. We have noted above that for a\nwide variety reasons (paras 95 to 97) parties may attempt to obtain\ncollusive orders on this issue. Any consideration and adjudication\non this aspect directly impacts the right to life of the child\nguaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_141\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India. It is a\nfirst principle of legal procedure and natural justice, that a person\naffected has a right to be heard.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_269\">170. So far as children are concerned, it is trite that the courts are\nparens patriae and it is the responsibility of the court to ensure the\nwelfare and best interest of the child in every proceeding where the\nrights and interest of the child are impacted. Such interest of the\nchild has to be ensured independent of the rights and claims of the\nparties to the lis.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_270\">171. As parens patriae, the court is bound to ensure the rights of\nthe child which has to include independent and fair representation\nas well as hearing to the child, before passing such order.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_271\">172. Para 81 of the three judge bench pronouncement of the\nSupreme Court reported at AIR 2003 SC 3450 Sharda v.\nDharmpal sheds some light on the consideration by the court in a\ncase involving any issue of the paternity of the child which reads\nthus:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_103\">        &quot;81. If for arriving at the satisfaction of the court and\n        to protect the right of a party to the lis who may\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_135\">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016                             Page 88 of 95</span>\n        otherwise be found to be incapable of protecting his\n       own interest, the court passes an appropriate order, the\n       question of such action being violative of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_142\">Article 21</a> of\n       the Constitution of India would not arise. The court\n       having regard to <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_143\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India\n       must also see to it that the right of a person to defend\n       himself must be adequately protected.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_272\">                           (Emphasis by us)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_273\">173. How can, say, as in a case as the present, the court protect\nthe rights of the child in question? This can only be done by\nensuring independent representation to the child at all stages of the\ncase where the aspect of paternity is being considered or is\ninvolved.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_274\">174. Valuable insight is shed on the standards and parameters\nwithin which the courts are bound to ensure the rights of the child\nin the &quot;Guidelines of the Committee of Ministers of the Council\nof Europe on child - friendly justice&quot;.       The Guidelines were\nadopted by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe\non the 17th of November 2010.        These Guidelines, though not\nbinding on the courts in India, but lend valuable guidance to the\nmanner in which the rights of the child, if and when in conflict with\nparents, or otherwise in judicial precedents can be adequately\nprotected.    Reference may usefully be made to Chapter IV\ncaptioned &quot;Child-friendly justice before, during and after judicial\nproceedings&quot;. Sub-Chapter A of this Chapter deals with &quot;Child-\nfriendly justice during judicial proceedings&quot;. We are concerned\nwith <a href=\"/doc/1893993/\" id=\"a_144\">Section 2</a> thereof which reads &quot;Legal counsel and\nrepresentation&quot;.

Impugned order\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_277\">176. It was imperative for the trial judge who was seized of the\napplication for a DNA examination of the minor child in the\npresent case on the 28th of January 2016 to consider the same, on\nthe binding parameters set out hereinabove. On that date the court\nhad almost the entire case of the respondent no.1 husband before it\ninasmuch as the substantive evidence of the respondent no.1 and\nhis main witness also stood recorded. Mr. Sandeep Sethi, learned\nSenior Counsel for the appellant has carefully taken us through the\nimpugned order dated 28th of January 2016 passed by the learned\nTrial Judge whereby the appellant&#x27;s application was allowed and\nthe directions were issued to the appellant to produce Baby &#x27;X&#x27; to\nthe office of the Director, CFSL, CGO Complex, Lodhi Road, New\nDelhi at 10:30 am on 10th February, 2016 when the respondent\nno.1would also be present so that samples of the child and the\nrespondent no.1 would be obtained by the laboratory in the\npresence of both parties for conducting the DNA test at the expense\nof the husband. Additionally the directions were made that prior\nthereto, the respondent no.1 shall deposit an amount of `1,00,000/-\nby way of demand draft/banker&#x27;s cheque in the name of the court\nwhich would stand forfeited and made over to the appellant in the\nevent that the paternity test on the basis of the DNA results shows\nthe husband to be the father of the child.

We find that the appellant had also objected to the DNA test\nreport relied upon by the respondent no.1 pointing out that the\nappellant was never joined in the testing and furthermore that the\nchild was the third party to the consideration.           The plea of\ncohabitation of the appellant and the respondent no.1 is also noted\nas also the denial of the respondent no.1. Without at all recording\nany prima facie conclusions in accordance with law, as noted by us\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_146\">MAT.APP.(FC)No.17/2016                              Page 92 of 95</span>\n above, simply observing that &quot;keeping in view the facts and\ncircumstances of this case and in view of the discussions made\nherein above&quot;, the court recorded its satisfaction that there was a\nneed for conducting the DNA test of the petitioner. In our view,\nthe Family Court has completely failed to consider the matter, as\nwas required in law. The impugned order dated 28th January, 2016\nis clearly contrary to the well settled principles noticed by us in the\nabove judgments, devoid of reasoning to support the order, fails to\nconsider or return a finding that the respondent no.1 had a prima\nfacie case in his favour and is legally not sustainable.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_282\">179. The instant case has to be examined from yet another\nperspective. In Bhabani Prasad Jena the Supreme Court has held\nthat the court must see whether the justice of the case requires a\nDNA testing and whether there is imminent need to do so. The\nrespondent no.1 before us is interested only in dissolution of his\nmarriage by decree of divorce. For this purpose, he has on two\nprior occasions filed the petitions for dissolution of marriage by a\ndecree of divorce by mutual consent (HMA No. 1099/2014 at Saket\nCourts &amp; HMA No. 783/2014 at Patiala House Courts).\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_283\">180.

If it was not for want of territorial\njurisdiction, these proceedings would have been completed.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_284\">181.
