Such letter of\nwarning is to be issued to a practitioner after holding\ndue inquiry and on finding him guilty of any\nmisconduct. The expression &quot;misconduct&quot; has been\nexplained in <a href=\"/doc/8029730/\" id=\"a_76\">Section 22 (1)</a> of the Act of 1965 to\nmean conviction of a registered practitioner by a\ncriminal court for an offence which involves moral\nturpitude and which is cognizable within the meaning\nof the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_77\">Code of Criminal Procedure</a>, 1973.

In the present case, admittedly, no inquiry\nhas been held against the petitioner as contemplated\nby Chapter VI of the Rules of 1967.

Now, coming to the second part of the\nimpugned communication whereby the petitioner has\nbeen   refrained from undertaking ultra sound/\nsonography practice is concerned, it is clear that such\ndirection has the effect of suspending the petitioner&#x27;s\nregistration indirectly without actually suspending\nsuch registration. In effect while the registration for\nthe petitioner continues, the petitioner has been\ndirected not to conduct any ultra sound / sonography\npractice. This fact is further clear as in the subsequent\nparagraph of the impugned communication it has\nbeen stated that the Council would have liberty to\npass an appropriate order of suspension or removal of\nthe petitioner&#x27;s name from the Register, if any, further\nirregularities and complaints were reported against\nher.   Thus,   without suspending      the   petitioner&#x27;s\nregistration she has been directed not to use any ultra\nsound sonography machine or equipment.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_57\">15.        The nature of power to be exercised by the\nMedical Council under <a href=\"/doc/12089692/\" id=\"a_82\">Section 23 (2)</a> of the Act of\n1994 was considered by the Division Bench in the case\nof Dr Ramineni Venugopal (supra). It was held that\nthough the Act of 1994 did not expressly provide for\n                                  25                   wp999.18.odt\n\ninterim suspension, the Medical Council in an\nappropriate case or in case of grave urgency could\nsuspend the registration as a holding order. In\nparagraph 34 it was observed as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">  &quot;34. Thus, if in a case of grave urgency and if\n  the Medical Council forms an opinion for\n  instance that the continuation of a medical\n  practitioner on its register for any length of\n  time is detrimental to public interest or is\n  likely to lead to the violation of the provisions\n  of the said Act, it can always issue an order of\n  suspension as a holding order and then follow\n  it by an enquiry to consider whether or not to\n  continue the suspension. The exercise of such\n  power would only be in cases where the\n  matter cannot be delayed at all.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_58\">16.        The aforesaid decision has been referred to\nand followed in the case of Dr Uttamkumar (supra) by\nanother Division Bench of which one of us (Shri\nA.S.Oka,J) was a party. It is, therefore, clear that in\ncase of grave urgency or in public interest, on the\nMedical Council forming such opinion in that regard it\ncould direct in public interest immediate suspension\nof registration of a medical practitioner. In the present\ncase, the impugned communication does not record\nthat the Council had formed an opinion that the\ncontinuation of the name of the petitioner in the\nregister was detrimental to public interest or that it\nwas likely to lead to the violation of the provisions of\nthe Act of 1994. In fact, the registration of the\npetitioner has not at all been suspended.

First,   it   is   worth   highlighting   that\njudgments cannot be interpreted in a vacuum,\nseparate from their facts and context. Observations\nmade in a judgment cannot be selectively picked in\norder to give them a particular meaning. The Court in\nthe <a href=\"/doc/816126/\" id=\"a_98\">Prem Nath Kaul</a> case (supra) had to determine the\nlegislative competence of the Yuvaraj, in passing a\nparticular enactment. The enactment was passed\nduring the interregnum period, before the formulation\nof the Constitution of State of Jammu and Kashmir,\nbut after coming into force of the Constitution of\nIndia.

Second, the framework of <a href=\"/doc/1825911/\" id=\"a_99\">Article 370 (2)</a>\nof the Indian Constitution was such that any decision\ntaken by the State Government, which was not an\nelected body but the Maharaja of the State acting on\nthe advice of the Council of Ministers which was in\noffice by virtue of the Maharaja&#x27;s proclamation dated\nMarch 5, 1948, prior to the sitting of the Constituent\nAssembly of the State, would have to be placed before\nthe Constituent Assembly, for its decision as provided\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1825911/\" id=\"a_100\">Article 370 (2)</a> of the Constitution. The\nrationale for the same is clear, as the task of the\nConstituent Assembly was to further clarify the scope\n                                  32                     wp999.18.odt\n\nand ambit of the constitutional relationship between\nthe Union of India and the State of Jammu and\nKashmir, on which the State Government as defined\nunder <a href=\"/doc/666119/\" id=\"a_101\">Article 370</a> might have already taken some\ndecisions, before the convening of the Constituent\nAssembly, which the Constituent Assembly in its\nwisdom, might ultimately not agree with. Hence, the\nCourt in the case of <a href=\"/doc/816126/\" id=\"a_102\">Prem Nath Kaul</a> (supra) indicated\nthat the Constituent Assembly&#x27;s decision under <a href=\"/doc/1825911/\" id=\"a_103\">Article\n370 (2)</a> was final. This finality has to be read as being\nlimited to those decisions taken by the State\nGovernment under <a href=\"/doc/666119/\" id=\"a_104\">Article 370</a> prior to the convening\nof the Constituent Assembly of the State, in line with\nthe language of <a href=\"/doc/1825911/\" id=\"a_105\">Article 370 (2).</a></span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"816126\" id=\"span_17\">44.

Even if we\nallow the appeal and remit the case to the High Court\nthe respondent&#x27;s election cannot be set aside after trial\nof the election petition as the relief for setting aside\nthe election has been rendered infructuous by lapse of\ntime. In this view grounds raised in the petition for\nsetting aside the election of the respondent have been\nrendered academic. Court should not undertake to\ndecide an issue unless it is a living issue between the\nparties. If an issue is purely academic in that its\ndecision one way or the other would have no impact\non the position of the parties, it would be waste of\npublic time to engage itself in deciding it.&quot;</span></span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_83\">                                       38                 wp999.18.odt\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_84\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"58889922\" id=\"span_33\">25.           There is also a guiding light from the Hon&#x27;ble Apex\n\nCourt in <a href=\"/doc/58889922/\" id=\"a_131\">Shrimanth Balasaheb Patil Vs. Speaker, Karnataka\n\nLegislative Assembly and Ors.</a> reported in (2020) 2 SCC 595 for\n\nreferring the matter to the Larger Bench. In paragraph 160 of <a href=\"/doc/58889922/\" id=\"a_132\">the\n\nsaid judgment</a>, it is observed as under:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">      &quot;160.       Any question of law of general importance\n      arising incidentally, or any ancillary question of law\n      having no significance to the final outcome, cannot be\n      considered as a substantial question of law. The\n      existence of substantial question of law does not\n      weigh on the stakes involved in the case, rather, it\n      depends on the impact the question of law will have\n      on the final determination. If the questions having a\n      determining effect on the final outcome have already\n      been decided by a conclusive authority, then such\n      questions cannot be called as &quot;substantial questions of\n      law&quot;. In any case, no substantial question of law exists\n      in the present matter, which needs reference to a\n      larger bench. The cardinal need is to achieve a judicial\n      balance between the crucial obligation to render\n      justice and the compelling necessity of avoiding\n      prolongation of any lis.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_85\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"65617241\" id=\"span_34\">26.
