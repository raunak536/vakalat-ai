The\nrespondent submitted that the information sought pertained to personal information\n\nof third parties and no public        interest was involved      in the matter. In        fact,\n\nappointments of the IAS officers in question were made 20 years prior to the date on\n\nwhich the RTI application was made. Hence, in view of <a href=\"/doc/22288/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 8(3)</a> of the RTI Act,\n\nexemption provided under <a href=\"/doc/802881/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 8(1)(i)</a> of the RTI Act was not available in to the\n\npresent case.

The appellant argued that the    cPIo   incorrectly denied information under\n\nSection    8(l)O of the RTI Act on the ground thar the information sought for\npertained   to   personal information   of third parties. He contended that the\nappointments     of IAS officers in question were made 20 years before the date          on\n\nwhich the RTI application was made. Hence, in view of the provisions contained\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/22288/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 8(3)</a> of the RTI Act, the exemption of personal information of third\n\nparty provided under <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 8(1)</a>O ofthe <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_8\">RTI Act</a> ceases to exist. Hence, the CpIO\n\nshould have provided the information sought for.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">\n5.2.   The respondent while defending their case reiterated that the information\n\nsought by the appellant pertained to personal information       of third     parties, the\n\ndisclosure of which had no relationship to any public interest and would have caused\n\nunwarranted invasion of the privacy of the third parties. The respondent emphasized\n\nthat the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme court of India in plethora of cases had held that the right\n\nto privacy was a fundamental right, and hence, the same could have not                 been\n\neclipsed   by ordinary statute. Hence, the infomation sought for could not be\ndisclosed under the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_9\">RTI Act</a>. The respondent denied the fact that\n\nthe right to privacy arose 20 years back and ended with the appointment. The\n\nrespondent contested the claim of the appellant that the limitation period   of20   years\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                                                              Page 3   of 1l</span>\n expired after lapse of 20 years from the date of appointment. It was contended that          it\n\nwas continuing and hence the provisions       of <a href=\"/doc/22288/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 8(3)</a> were not attracted in that\n\ncase.

It   is thus important to recognize\n\n       that, in this context, there is a conflict of fundamental rights, between\n\n       transparency and privacy. This requires careful balancing.

The division which classified the\n\npensioners into two classes on the basis of the specific date was devoid              of   any\n\nrational principle and was both arbitrary sand unprincipled being unrelated to the\n\nobject sought to be achieved by grant of liberalized pension and the guarantee of\n\nequal treatment contained in <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_21\">Article 14</a> was violated inasmuch as the pension rules\n\nwhich were statutory in character meted out differential and discriminatory\n\ntreatment   to   equals   in the matter of      computation   of pension from the        dates\n\nspecified in the impugned memoranda.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_21\">                                                                                     Page 8   of   ll\n 5.14. In the case under consideration issue is whether the personal information\n\ncould be disclosed. As per the provisions of sub-section (3) of <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 8</a> of the\n\nRTI Act, personal information which is in the custody of public authority may be\n\ndisclosed after 20 years from the date of occurrence. Perhaps the RTI Act aims to\n\nensure greater accountability so as to make the public authorities more progressive,\n\nparticipatory and meaningful.    The operation of the statue would provide more\n\naccess to the information and thus bring transparency and   accountability. <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_23\">The RTI\n\nAct</a> is a statute Act which provides for rights and obligations of persons.

There has   to be harmonious\nconstruction of both the provisions.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\">\n5.15. The Supreme Court in plethora ofcases had held that the right to privacy is\n\nan evolving right which may vary from case to case and depending upon the facts\n\nof the case and public interest involved in disclosure of information. Right to\n\nPrivacy being a facet to the Right to Life and personal liberty is on a higher\n\npedestal and a harmonious construction of the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_25\">RTI Act</a> and of the\n\nConstitutionai provisions would necessitate reading down of the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_26\">RTI\n\nAct</a> so as to avoid illegality of the statutory provisions. Moreover, the respondent\n\nargued that   it was not an event or occurrence which happened 20 years back.

The Commission after adverting to the facts and circumstances of the case,\n\nhearing both parties and perusal of records, feels that the right to privacy being a\n\nfacet of fundamental right under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_27\">Article 21</a> of the constitution has to be protected\n\nin accordance with the three parameters laid down by the Supreme Court in the\n\ncase of K.S.Puttaswamy (Supm) i.e.       (i) there must be legal object, (ii) there must\n\nbe legal framework and     (iii)   there must be nexus between the ob.lective to be\n\nachieved and the privacy to be compromised.       It   appears that for meeting different\n\ntreatment, there must be a reasonable classification and the classification must\n\nhave a rational nexus with the objective to be achieved.         If   we take that the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_28\">RTI\n\nAct</a> contains provisions providing framework for disclosures outweighing right to\n\nprivacy under <a href=\"/doc/22288/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 8(3)</a>         of the RTI Act which aims transparency              and\n\naccountability, the appellant may be entitled for the information ol the occurrence\n\n\n\n\nalorementioned parameters. However, the respondent have claimed that the\n\noccurence was not a onetime event i.e. the Right to Privacy is a continuous\n\nprocess and drawing a line of giving applications for appointment as such may not\n\nbe a water tight compartment wherein the Right to Privacy was not existing or\n\ncontinuing after the lapse of20 years.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_25\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_26\">                                                                                 Page 10   of   ll\n        Proviso to sub <a href=\"/doc/1979161/\" id=\"a_30\">section 3</a> of <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_31\">section 8</a> of the RTI Act provides that wherein a\n\nquestion arises as to the date from which the said period     of 20 years has to be\ncomputed the decision of the central Government shall be final subject to the usual\n\nappeals provided in this    Act.
