He again submits that  accused is a married person and he has \n\none small children   and wife of accused Surender Rai is pregnant.   The \n\noffence   u/s 376 <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_13\">IPC</a> could not be proved on record hence, accused has \n\nbeen acquitted for the offence<a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_14\"> u/s 376</a> IPC.    He has old age mother who is \n\naged   about   70   years   old.   Elder   brother   of   accused   Surender   Rai   has \n\nalready been expired.    Ld. Counsel again submits that accused Surender \n\nRai has ailing parents and they needs the presence of accused with them \n\nto look after.  He is the only bread earner in his family.    He further submits \n\nthat accused has no previous criminal history and he   has never misused \n\nthe   liberty   of   bail   and   never   tried   to   cause   any   interruption   in   the \n\nadministration of justice.

Counsel   for   the   accused   prayed   for \n\nrelease of accused on probation of good conduct.   \n\n       Ld. Counsel for accused Yogita and Manoj Kumar submits that they \n\nare husband and wife.  They have small children to look after.  The offence \n\nu/s   376   <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_15\">IPC</a>   could   not   be   proved   on   record   hence,   accused   has   been \n\nacquitted for the offence<a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_16\"> u/s 376</a> IPC.     Ld. Counsel again submits that \n\naccused persons have ailing parents and small  school going children to \n\nlook after.       He further submits that accused persons have no previous \n\ncriminal history and they have never misused the liberty of bail and never \n\ntried to cause any interruption in the administration of justice.     On these \n\ngrounds   ld.

The room was locked from the out side by \n\n   them.    The offence of rape was committed by the accused Surender  in \n\n   connivance   with   the   co­accused   persons   since   they   had   instigated \n\n   accused   Surender   Rai   to   commit   the   sexual   intercourse     against   the \n\n   wishes of prosecutrix Pooja @ Monika.

I was in love with the \n             accused Surender Rai and Surender Rai also used to love \n             with me and accused Surender Rai had promised to marry \n             me.  Accused Surender Rai had even come to my house to \n             talk to my  mother  and  my  mother  was  willing  to get  me \n             married to the accused saying that the boy and the family \n             were   good   and   she   told   him   that   he   should   consult   his \n             family and we will consult ours.   My family was willing to \n             marry   me   off   to   the   accused   but   the   accused   had   not \n             informed his family.   The accused took me and introduced \n             to   his   sister   and   Jijaji   and   they   used   to   reside   in   Hari \n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                                                                               10 </span>\n Nagar.  The sister and Jijaji also gifted me a Sari and lots \nof talks were going on in the family and I also used to keep \nfast of Karva Chauth.  The two  photographs on record are \nshown   to   the   witness   and   the   witness   identifies   the \nphotographs   which   were   taken   on   Karva   Chauth.     The \naccompanying boy in the photograph is accused Surender \nRai present in court today.  The photographs are Ex Pw9/A \n                            nd\nand Pw9/B.       On  22        \n                                October 2005 I came to know that  \naccused Surender Rai had run away with some other girl \nand I had lodged the present complaint on 01/11/06.  The \ncomplaint   is   Ex   Pw9/C   signed   by   me  at   point   A.     I   had \nlodged   the   complaint   since   the   accused   had   played  a \nfraud   with me saying that he would marry me.     The \naccused had made forcible physical  relations with me \nseveral   times   and   we   had   also   gone   out   of   station \ntogether.     All the members of our family came to know \nabout   the   fact   of   physical   relationship   of   mine   with   the \naccused Surender Rai.  Thereafter I came to know that the \naccused   had   eloped   with   one   girl   then   I   took   all   the \nphotographs which was snapped with the accused to his \nhouse and shown to his family members for the purpose of \nconvincing   them   about   the   relationship.     The   family \nmembers   of   the  accused   promised   me  that   I   should   not \nmade   any   complaint   they   also   insured   me   about \nmarrying me with the accused Surender Rai.  The parents \nof the girl Pooja Aggarwal  to whom the  accused ran away \nand   I  had gone   to the PS to lodge the complaint.   The \nphysical   relationship   was   established   by   the   accused \noutside the place but I do not know the name of that place. \nAs   and   when   the   accused   made   a   physical   relationship \nwith me no one from his family was present there however \nonce  upon  a time we  went  to the  house  of  sister  of  the \naccused   where   he     physically   abused   me.    I   cannot \nidentify the sister and his brother in law of the accused \nsince   they   were   faded   from   my   memory   as   such   I \ncould   not   recollect.     At   the   time   of   the   arrest   of   the \naccused  Surender  Rai    I signed on the arrest memo Ex \nPw4/A signed by me at point B and the personal search \nmemo Ex Pw4/B signed by me at point B.   I also signed \nthe seizure memo of the photographs same is Ex Pw9/D \nsigned by me at point B.  \n\nI have also signed on the seizure of exhibits Pw9/E  signed \nby me at point A.

Heard Allowed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\">XXXXXXXXBy Ld.APP for State.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_12\">It is correct that in the year 2005 I used to work in a private \ncompany operated in Rajouri Garden.   It is correct that in \nJanuary 2005 I had met accused Surender Rai and he put \nbefore me a proposal for marriage.   It is correct that after \nsome   time   accused   Surender   Rai   took   me  to   his   house \nsaying that his sister and brother in law(Jeeja) wanted to \nmeet  you.      It  is  correct  that   I  reached   the house  I  met \nsister   of   accused   Surender   and   his   Jeeja   Manoj.     It   is \ncorrect that sister of accused Surender prepared Tea and \nafter   having   tea   sister   and   brother   in   law   of   accused \nSurender went outside the room.  It is correct that after the \nsister and brother in law of accused went outside accused \nSurender Rai closed the door.     After closing of the door \naccused Surender Rai started getting forcibly with me and \nwhen I refused he said that what is the harm when he is \ngoing to marry me.   When I again refused saying that this \nact of sexual intercourse can be done only after marriage \nthen he threatened me and told me that he will not marry \nme and that he will get my brother and sister killed and I \nbecame   frightened.     It   is   correct   that   when   I   tried   to   go \noutside the door I found the door was locked from outside \nand   accused   Surender   Rai   then   forcibly   had   sexual \nintercourse with me.   It is correct that I started crying and \nSurender   Rai   asked   his   Jeeja   to   open   the   door   and \nthereafter   the   sister   and   brother   in   law   of   Surender   Rai \nopened the door and threatened me as I was crying and \ntold me that I should not narrate the incident to anybody.  It \nis correct that on 17/10/06 accused Surender Rai had ran \naway with some other girl and in his that act also his sister \nand   brother   in   law   helped   him.     It   is   correct   that   the \naccused   Surender   Rai   has   falsely   assured   to   marry   me \nand had sexual intercourse with me and destroyed my life. \nIt is correct that accused Yogita @ Pinky and Manoj who \nare   the   sister   and   Jeeja   of   accused   Surender   Rai   had \nlocked   the   door   from   outside   and   helped   Surender   Rai \nwhen he had forcible sexual intercourse with me.  Both the \naccused Yogita and Manoj are present in court today.\n</p>  \n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_13\">It   is   correct   that   on   the   day   of   the   hearing   of   the   bail \napplication of the accused Surender Rai which was listed \nfor   24/11/06   the   counsel   Sh.Suresh   Chand   for   accused \nSurender   Rai   and   his   sister   Yogita   and   brother   in   law \nManoj(both accused) had taken me to the court and told \nme   that they had a conversation with accused Surender \n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                                                                    12 </span>\n Rai and once I helped them in getting bail from the court \naccused   Surender   Rai   on   coming   outside   from   the   Jail \nwould marry me.   I thought that as it is my life has been \ndestroyed   by   these   accused   persons   and   who   will   now \nmarry me and if the accused Surender Rai is thinking of \nmarrying   me   and   these   persons   had   also   offered   me \nmoney.  Thinking that accused Surender Rai would marry I \nwent  to the court along  with the counsel of  the accused \nSurender Rai,   without informing my mother and father \nand   I   gave   my   statement   in   court   as   per   the   advice \ngiven to me by the counsel for accused Surender Rai \nand after I gave my statement  accused Surender  Rai \nwas ordered to be released on bail.   It is correct that \nafter   being   released   on   bail   accused   Surender   Rai \nrefused  to  marry  me  and  instead   threatened  me  that \nnow he has been released from Jail and I cannot  do \nanything and previously he was arrested by the Police \nand now he will not even be arrested.   It is correct that \non   that   day   the  advocate   Sh.Suresh   Chand   had \nforcefully   made   me   sign   some   papers   which   were \nblank.

It   is   incorrect   to   suggest   that \nDevi Sharan Aggarwal did not instigated me to get register \nthe complaint against the accused persons.  The accused \nSurender Rai present in the court was apprehended by the \nSI Rajni Chopra after two days after registration of the FIR \nhowever the accused Surender Rai was present along with \nPooja Aggarwal.

It   is   incorrect   to \n              suggest   that   I   was   deployed   in   the   factory   where   the \n              accused   Surender   Rai   was   working.     Accused   Surender \n              Rai used to see off and receive on this factory.  It is correct \n              that I used to occasionally visit the accused Surender Rai. \n              It is correct  that the  accused  Surender  Rai  also  used to \n              come   at   my   residence   and   I   also   know   all   the   family \n              members of the accused Surender Rai.

It is correct that I was \n              very much affectionate with the accused Surender Rai.   It \n              is correct that twice I visited the High Court along with the \n              accused Surender Rai.   I did not appear at the Hon&quot;rable \n              High Court along with Sh.Suresh Chandra counsel for the \n              accused Surender Rai for quasing of the FIR.

It is argued by the  ld. Counsel for the \n\n   accused that prosecutrix is major girl.   She was in love with accused \n\n   Surender Rai.  ld.

He   testified   that   Pooja   stated   that   she   had   gone   with \n\n   accused of her own.       ld. Counsel for accused again submitted that \n\n   testimony of prosecutrix also indicates that she was consented party. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_26\">   Ld. Counsel again submitted that there was no injury on the private part \n\n   of the prosecutrix as per deposition of PW11 Dr. Namita since she has \n\n   stated that on local examination, her hymen was found intact and no \n\n   marks   of   injury   were   found.       On   these   grounds   ld.

APP argued and submitted that prosecution has suc­\n\n  cessfully proved its case since prosecutrix has correctly identified the ac­\n\n  cused as culprit who raped her.   Ld.  APP further argued and submitted \n\n  that alone statement of prosecutrix is sufficient to hold the accused guilty \n\n  in rape cases.   In support of his contentions he has stated that it has \n\n  been held on the point of sexual assault that:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">                      &quot;The testimony of victim in cases of sexual offences is vital and \n                      unless there are compelling reasons which necessitate looking for \n                      corroboration of her statement, the Courts should find no difficulty \n                      to   act   on   the   testimony   of   a   victim   of   sexual   assault   alone   to \n                      convict and accused where her testimony inspires confidence and \n                      is found  to be  reliable.    Seeking  corroboration  of  her  statement \n                      before relying upon the same, as a rule, in such cases amounts to \n                      adding  insult  to   injury.     Why  should  the   evidence  of  a  girl  or   a \n                      woman who complains of rape of sexual molestation, be viewed \n                      with doubt, disbelief or suspicion?

The evidence of a \n                  victim of sexual assault stands almost at par with the evidence on \n                  an injured witness and to an extent is even more reliable.  Just as \n                  a witness who has sustained some injury in the occurrence, which \n                  is not found to be self inflicted, is considered to be a good witness \n                  in the  sense  that  he is least likely  to shield  the real culprit,  the \n                  evidence of a victim of a sexual offence is entitled to great weight, \n                  absence of corroboration notwithstanding.  Corroborative evidence \n                  is not an imperative component of judicial credence in every case \n                  of rape.   Corroboration as a condition for judicial reliance on \n                  the testimony of the prosecutrix is not a requirement of law \n                  but  a  guidance  of  prudence  under  given   circumstances.    It \n                  must not be overlooked that a woman or a girl subjected to \n                  sexual   assault   is   not   an   accomplice   to   the   crime   but   is   a \n                  victim   of   another   person&#x27;s     lust   and   it   is   improper   and \n                  undesirable   to   test   her   evidence   with   a   certain   amount   of \n                  suspicion,   treating   her   as   if   she   were   an   accomplice. \n                  Inferences   have   to   be   drawn   from   a   given   set   of   facts   and \n                  circumstances with realistic diversity and not dead uniformity lest \n                  that type of rigidity I the shape of rule of law is introduced through \n                  a   new   form   of   testimonial   tyranny   making   justice   a   causality. \n                  Courts   cannot   cling   to   a   fossil   formula   and   insist   upon \n                  corroboration even if, taken as a whole, the case spoken of by the \n                  victim of sex crime strikes the judicial mind as probable.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1987122\" id=\"span_15\">In another case of  <a href=\"/doc/1987122/\" id=\"a_32\">S.

Nowhere \n\n  the   matters   appears   to   have   been   reported   even   intermittently  which \n\n  indicates  that   no   sexual   intercourse   between   the   parties   took   place \n\n  against the wishes of prosecutrix.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_62\">19.But simultaneously it can be inferred beyond reasonable doubt that at \n\n  various occasions accused caused intrusion with intend to outrage the \n\n  modesty of the prosecutrix.   In this regard the deposition of   PW9 Smt. \n\n  Monika categorically reveals that accused had played a fraud  with  her \n\n  saying that he would marry her.   The accused had made forcible \n\n  physical  relations with her several times and she had also gone out \n\n  of station together.   Further, on careful perusal of her testimony it has \n\n  also come on record that   she admitted  that when she started crying, \n\n  Surender Rai asked his Jeeja to open the door.   Thereafter, sister and \n\n  brother­in­law of Surender Rai opened the door.   They also threatened \n\n  her   not to narrate the incident to anybody.
