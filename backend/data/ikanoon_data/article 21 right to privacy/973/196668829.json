Originally, the appellant instituted a Public Interest Litigation, CWP No.\n\n3118 of 2000, after coming across an article published in the Hindi daily\n\nRashtriya Sahara on 17.05.2000 under the caption “Dozens of Beggars\n\nsuffering from Cholera and Gastroenteritis and around 50 of them, admitted in\n\nHospital”. The news item further reported that 107 patients suffering from\n\ngastroenteritis had been admitted to the Maharishi Valmiki Infectious Diseases\n\nHospital, Kingsway Camp, Delhi. These patients had been brought from the\n\nBeggars’ Home at Lampur (Narela) and were identified as suffering from\n\ncholera.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_6\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_7\">4.    It was further stated in the writ petition that on 19.05.2000, another news\n\nitem appeared in the Hindi daily Dainik Jagran, reporting that six inmates of the\n\nBeggars’ Home at Lampur (Narela) had died, and that a magisterial inquiry had\n\nbeen ordered by the Chief Minister of Delhi. On the same day, Rashtriya\n\nSahara published another report stating that the condition of several beggars\n\nsuffering from gastroenteritis remained serious. The Hindustan Times, an\n\nEnglish daily, also reported on 19.05.2000 that the Chief Minister had ordered a\n\nmagisterial inquiry, and that various departments of the Delhi Government were\n\naccusing one another of negligence in this matter.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">\f                                         3</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">5.    According to the appellant, the Minister of Social Welfare, Government\n\nof NCT of Delhi, issued a statement – allegedly by suppressing material facts –\n\nin order to shirk responsibility, claiming that all the beggars had died natural\n\ndeaths. This statement was reported in Rashtriya Sahara on 20.05.2000. On the\n\nsame day, The Times of India reported that six inmates of the Beggars’ Home\n\nhad died of cholera. On 23.05.2000, Rashtriya Sahara carried another report\n\nstating that the Municipal Commissioner of Delhi had confirmed the death of\n\neight beggars in the Beggars Home. The Superintendent of the Certified\n\nInstitution, Lampur (Narela), however, denied that such deaths had occurred in\n\nthe home.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_10\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_11\">6.    It was also stated in the writ petition that further reports appeared on\n\n30.05.2000 in both Rashtriya Sahara (Hindi) and The Hindustan Times\n\n(English), indicating, inter alia, that the magisterial probe initially entrusted to\n\nSDM Shri J.K. Jain had been disregarded, and that a fresh probe had been\n\ninitiated by the Additional District Magistrate of North-West District, Delhi.\n\nThese reports also mentioned that a Pakistani national had escaped from the\n\nBeggars’ Home, and that his confinement there, instead of in jail, was itself a\n\nmystery. The articles described the Delhi Government’s claims of improvement\n\nin the Beggars’ Home as “a bundle of lies” asserting that a large number of the\n\nbeggars were, in fact, destitute.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">\f                                             4</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_12\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_13\">7.          Alleging that the authorities were misleading the public and concealing\n\nthe real facts and figures concerning the loss of valuable lives, and further\n\ncontending that citizens of India – whether free, confined, or detained in jail –\n\nare entitled to live dignified lives as guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1\">Article 21</a> of the\n\nConstitution, and that the inmates of the Beggars’ Home are equally entitled to\n\nsuch protection, the appellant approached the High Court seeking the following\n\nreliefs:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">     (i)       A writ, order, or direction in the nature of mandamus under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_2\">Article\n\n               226</a> of the Constitution directing the respondents to fix responsibility\n\n               upon those accountable for the deaths of the inmates in the Beggars’\n\n               Home;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_14\">     (ii)      Directions to the respondents to grant compensation to the dependents\n\n               of the inmates who died in the Beggars’ Home, at the rate of at least\n\n               Rs.5,00,000/- per head;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_15\">     (iii)     Appropriate orders to punish, in accordance with law, the respondents\n\n               or their subordinates found responsible, severally and jointly; and\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_16\">     (iv)      Such further orders or directions as the Hon’ble Court may deem fit\n\n               and proper in the facts and circumstances of the case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_17\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_18\">8.          During the pendency of the petition, the Additional District Magistrate\n\n(ADM) submitted his report to the Government on 01.06.2000, concluding that\n\nthe deaths of inmates were primarily attributable to the consumption of water\n\nfrom hand-pumps, for which the Beggars’ Home authorities as well as the\n\nPublic Works Department (Civil) were mainly responsible. On the other hand,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">\f                                             5</span>\n\n\nthe Superintendent of Beggars’ Home, by letter dated 15.07.2000 addressed to\n\nthe National Human Rights Commission, asserted that all the deaths in the\n\nBeggars’ Home were natural deaths.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_19\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_20\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"108947648\" id=\"span_11\">9.     By order dated 28.11.2000, the High Court directed the committee\n\nalready appointed in CWP. No. 667/1997 [<a href=\"/doc/108947648/\" id=\"a_3\">Som Datt and others v. NCT of Delhi\n\nand others</a>] to visit the Lampur Beggars’ Home Complex and Tahirpur Shahdara\n\nBeggars’ Home, ascertain the conditions prevailing therein, and submit a report,\n\nbesides finding out the reasons for the death of beggars in Lampur Beggars’\n\nHome. The respondents filed their reply, setting out the remedial measures taken\n\nto improve the conditions in the Beggars’ Home, but without effectively\n\ncontradicting the alleged causes of disease and death. After inquiry, the\n\ncommittee submitted its interim report dated 09.01.2001. The appellant filed a\n\nrejoinder affidavit reiterating the facts stated in the writ petition.</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_21\">10.    Taking note of the affidavits and the committee’s report, the High Court\n\ndisposed of the writ petition, by order dated 15.10.2001, the relevant paragraphs\n\nof which are reproduced below, for better appreciation:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">       “An affidavit has been filed by Mr. N. Diwakar, Director, Department of Social\n       Welfare dated 5th January, 2001 annexing the death certificates of various\n       beggars detained at Lampur. The cause of death is mentioned as Cardio\n       Respiratory failure. A brief fact finding Administrative Report has been filed by\n       the SDM, Narela about the death of six beggars in the Lampur home. The report\n       shows that there was contamination in the water supply and it did not measure\n       up to the hygienic standards. It was also found that the chlorinator plant was\n       not functioning and the chlorine was never checked for maintenance. The hand\n       pumps were found to be unsatisfactory and as a consequence thereof a large\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">\f                                       6</span>\n\n\nnumber of inmates suffered from gastroenteritis. The report found the presence\nof E. coli which indicated faecal contamination in water and the probable cause\nof death is stated to be the passage of human excreta into the drinking water and\nsubsequent passage of vibrio cholera bacteria from one inmate to another by\nway of simple transmission by contact through the water. It was found that the\nshallow ground water table as well as soil near the sources of water has been\ncontaminated. Various suggestions were made to improve the conditions.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">A detailed investigation pursuant to the report of SDM, Narela, was carried out\nby Shri. Manpreet Singh, Inquiry Officer, who submitted a report dated 1 st June,\n2000. The report noted that there was cholera out break in the beggars home\nand since contamination of water is reason for the same, there could be not\ndoubt about the cause of deaths. It is further stated that since no post mortem\nhad been carried out in all the six cases, the fact that the patients died of\ncholera cannot be established, notwithstanding the report of the part time\ndoctor, sh. Sukhija declaring the deaths to be natural. The report found that the\nsuperintendents of in-charge of the Home had failed to take certain precautions\nand if they had been vigilant enough, immediate medical attention could have\nbeen provided to the inmates. The PWD was held responsible for the lapse\ninsofar as the leakage of the water from the rear wall of the bathroom was\nconcerned which contaminated the water and the PWD, Electrical, was mainly\nheld responsible for the generators not being functioning for operation of the\ntube wells.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">Insofar as the improvement of the conditions of the homes are concerned, the\nreports have been filed from time to time to slow the progress of the work.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">It has been stated before us on 3rd October, 2001 by the learned counsel for the\nrespondents that in pursuance to the report of the SDM, Narela and the\nsubsequent report, Shri B.S Tolia and Shri M.S Meena have been placed under\nsuspension and are facing departmental proceedings. It is stated that\nproceedings for major penalties are in progress against these officers for the\nnegligence in handling of the homes resulting in death of the inmates.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">In view of the action which has already been initiated the only direction\nnecessary is that the respondents will proceed expeditiously with the\ndepartmental proceedings and conclude the same within a period of six months\nfrom today. Order accordingly. Thus the first and third prayer in the petition\nstand satisfied in view of an enquiry having been held into the incident and the\nresponsibility having been fixed. The respondent will take all further necessary\naction against the persons responsible for the tragedy.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">Insofar as relief No. 2 is concerned, no relation has so far come forth in respect\nof the death of these beggars. If such a claim is received by the Department, it\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">\f                                            7</span>\n\n\n      shall be duly examined and appropriate compensation will be assessed and\n      disbursed to them.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">      We have already indicated that the present writ petition is being confined to the\n      reliefs claimed for. We, however, note that in pursuance to the report of the\n      special committee and the departmental action to remedy the situation in the\n      beggars home, steps have been taken from time to time and reports have been\n      filed. In view of this, we are inclined to issue a further direction to the\n      respondents to complete the action in terms of making the homes more habitable\n      in consonance with the reports of the fact finding committee within a maximum\n      period of six months from today.”\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_22\">11.   Thereafter, the appellant filed C.M. No. 11595 of 2002 seeking\n\nimplementation of the order dated 15.10.2001. The said application was\n\ndisposed of by the High Court, merely granting liberty to the appellant to\n\napproach the appropriate forum if still dissatisfied. Hence, the appellant has\n\napproached this Court by way of the present appeal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_23\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_24\">12.   The learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the High Court, on\n\n28.11.2000, had appointed a committee comprising Court Officers (Deputy\n\nRegistrar and Legal Assistant of the High Court) and three advocates – Mr. R.K.\n\nSaini, Ms. Rekha Agarwal, and Ms. Sushmita Lal – to investigate the episode of\n\neight unnatural deaths and the outbreak of a cholera epidemic in the Beggars’\n\nHome, Lampur, Narela, New Delhi, in May 2000. This committee was directed\n\nto submit a fact-finding report at the earliest, and on 09.1.2001, submitted only\n\nan interim report, seeking more time for a final report due to the gravity of the\n\nmatter involving large-scale deaths, a serious epidemic, criminal negligence,\n\nmisfeasance, and atrocities on inmates. Thereafter, no extension was granted,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">\f                                        8</span>\n\n\nand the High Court, on 08.07.2003, passed the final order without ascertaining\n\ncompliance with its earlier order dated 15.10.2001 and without obtaining the\n\ncommittee’s final report.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_25\">12.1. It was further submitted that the interim findings revealed shocking\n\nlapses, including human excreta mixing with drinking and cooking water, food\n\nunfit for human consumption, physical assaults on inmates and the use of\n\nferocious dogs to terrorize inmates and force them to work in nearby private\n\nagricultural fields for the vested interests of caretakers and managing officers.\n\nThe committee also found officers absent or intoxicated during inspections and\n\nhad sought more time for a thorough inquiry to fix responsibility and\n\nrecommend remedies, which request was ignored by the High Court.\n\n12.2. Learned counsel further alleged that the respondents filed false and\n\nmisleading reports before the National Human Rights Commission and the High\n\nCourt, concealing facts from multiple authorities including the Sub Divisional\n\nMagistrate, Narela, ADM North-west Delhi, Municipal Commissioner, relevant\n\nmedical and ministerial authorities, the Chief Minister, and the Lt. Governor of\n\nDelhi. It was also submitted that the respondents misled the court in WP (C) No.\n\n3118/2000, as noted by the Director of Vigilance, Government of NCT of Delhi.\n\nThe High Court wrongly relied solely on the respondents’ counter affidavit and\n\nthe interim committee report, ignoring the appellant’s rejoinder, the need for\n\nfinal verification of claimed improvements, and the responsibility for criminal\n\nnegligence and atrocities. The order dated 15.10.2001 had directed completion\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">\f                                         9</span>\n\n\nof remedial actions within six months, yet no final report was filed after that\n\nperiod, and the affidavit along with the Vigilance Director’s letter dated\n\n20.05.2002 indicating false averments, was disregard by the High Court in the\n\nimpugned order. It was also submitted that no officer has been held accountable,\n\nand Beggars’ Homes continue to suffer from serious shortcomings, bottlenecks,\n\nand problems.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_26\">12.3. With these submissions, the learned counsel prayed for appropriate\n\ndirections to ensure accountability, proper inspection, and genuine improvement\n\nin the conditions of certified institutions under the Government of NCT of\n\nDelhi.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_27\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_28\">13.      On the other hand, the learned counsel for the respondents submitted that\n\nthe High Court carefully considered the report of the fact-finding committee and\n\nthe affidavit filed by the respondents regarding the improvements and actions\n\ntaken by the second respondent based on the reports submitted by SDM and\n\nADM. Being satisfied with the status report submitted by the respondents, the\n\nHigh Court passed a justifiable order in the writ petition, with respect to the\n\nreliefs claimed by the appellant, which had been duly complied with by the\n\nrespondents.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_29\">13.1. According to the learned counsel, based on the special committee’s report\n\nrelating to remedial measures in Beggars’ Homes, steps were taken from time to\n\ntime and reports were filed by the respondents. The respondents are strictly\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">\f                                         10</span>\n\n\nfollowing the provisions of the Begging Act and Rules. However, the appellant\n\nraked up fresh developments by filing the present application, which is not only\n\na gross abuse of process of law but also not maintainable. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"592033\" id=\"span_17\">In this regard,\n\nreference was made to the decision of this court in <a href=\"/doc/592033/\" id=\"a_4\">State of Uttar Pradesh v.\n\nBrahm Datt Sharma</a> and another2, wherein it was held that ‘when proceedings\n\nstand terminated by final disposal of a writ petition, it is not open to the Court to\n\nreopen the proceedings by means of a miscellaneous application in respect of a\n\nmatter which provides a fresh cause of action’.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_30\">13.2. Continuing further, the learned counsel submitted that after passing of the\n\norder dated 15.10.2001 by the High Court, all efforts were taken to complete the\n\ndisciplinary proceedings initiated against the delinquent officials. Accordingly,\n\ninquiry was completed and the competent authority imposed the punishment of\n\npenalty on them. The delay in completion of inquiry was occasioned on account\n\nof the requirement of obtaining concurrence from the Department of Vigilance,\n\nGovernment of NCT of Delhi, and the Central Vigilance Commission, as per the\n\nprocedure laid down.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_31\">13.3. It was further submitted that the second respondent, namely, the\n\nDepartment of Social Welfare, Government of NCT of Delhi, administers\n\nvarious statutory and non-statutory social welfare programmes for the weaker\n\nsections of society and is entrusted with the implementation of social\n\nlegislations such as the <a href=\"/doc/167447/\" id=\"a_5\">Probation of Offenders Act, 1958</a>, the Juvenile Justice\n\n2 (1987) 2 SCC 179\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">\f                                             11</span>\n\n\n<a href=\"/doc/44602593/\" id=\"a_6\">(Care and Protection of Children) Act, and the Bombay Prevention of Begging\n\nAct, 1959</a> (BPBA). The Department of Social Welfare functions as the nodal\n\nagency for the implementation of the BPBA, which was extended to the NCT of\n\nDelhi in the year, 1960. For the purpose of operationalising the Act, the\n\nGovernment notified the Delhi Prevention of Begging Rules, 1960.\n\n13.4. It was further pointed out that there are eleven statutory institutions\n\nestablished for accommodating beggars during their trial and sentence periods,\n\nas determined by the Beggars’ Court. In addition to the regular Beggar’s Court,\n\ntwo Mobile Beggars’ Courts were also set up in 2009. The duration of detention\n\nin these institutions varies according to the merits of each case. The daily life of\n\nthe inmates is regulated in accordance with the Department’s Manual, which\n\nprovides for free food, lodging, boarding, clothing, bedding, medical care,\n\nrecreation, and rehabilitation facilities.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_32\">13.5. With respect to improvements of living conditions and hygiene in the\n\nBeggars’ Home in dispute, affidavits had been filed earlier and accepted by the\n\nHigh Court. Additional measures included regular inspection of food by Welfare\n\nofficers, provision of clothing and bedding, supply of safe drinking water from\n\nDelhi Jal Board, a functional ambulance for emergencies, vocational training in\n\ntrades like weaving, tailoring, and cycle repair, PWD maintenance and repairs,\n\ninstallation of false ceilings in dormitories, and engagement of the NGO Caring\n\nFoundation for counselling, rehabilitation, detoxification, acupuncture therapy,\n\nand recreational programmes. A new sewerage tank was operational, and anti-\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">\f                                        12</span>\n\n\nbegging squads were given arrest guidelines. Volunteers from NGOs and Delhi\n\nUniversity’s Faculty of Law visited the Reception-cum-Classification Centre for\n\ncounselling and legal aid. Family members of detainees were informed by post\n\nor phone, workshops were held for caretakers, procurement guidelines were\n\nstreamlined, and food, water supply, and health services were monitored\n\nregularly. In view of these measures, the learned counsel submitted that nothing\n\nsurvives in this appeal and it deserves to be dismissed.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_33\">14.   Mr. Ranjit Kumar, learned senior counsel, appointed as amicus curiae,\n\nsubmitted that a detailed synopsis of the functioning of Beggars’ Homes, along\n\nwith suggestions and proposed directions to the respondents, had already been\n\nplaced before this Court. Pursuant thereto, this Court issued various directions\n\nto the respondents, which have also been complied with to the considerable\n\nextent. He further submitted that such remedial measures ought to be extended\n\nto all Beggars’ Homes across the country, so as to prevent recurrence of lapses\n\nin hygiene, health care, and living conditions, and to secure the dignity and\n\nfundamental rights of the inmates.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_34\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_35\">15.

Historically, the treatment of the indigent persons has oscillated between\n\ntwo diametrically opposed paradigms – criminalisation on the one hand and\n\ncompassion on the other. In early modern England, the Elizabethan Poor Laws\n\nof 1601 institutionalised a moral distinction between the &quot;deserving poor&quot; –\n\nthose unable to work due to age, disability, or illness – and the &quot;undeserving\n\npoor&quot;, typically the able-bodied unemployed, vagrants, or itinerants. While the\n\nformer could receive parish relief, the latter were subjected to harsh punitive\n\nmeasures, including confinement in workhouses, corporal punishment, or forced\n\nlabour. These measures were grounded not in a rehabilitative ethic but in a\n\ndisciplinary and deterrent framework aimed at social control.\n\n16.1. This colonial attitude travelled to India under British rule. Vagrancy laws\n\n– including the <a href=\"/doc/44602593/\" id=\"a_7\">Bombay Prevention of Begging Act, 1959</a> (and its variants in\n\nother states) – were introduced not as instruments of social welfare, but as tools\n\nof public order and colonial governance. Their design mirrored the Victorian\n\nand Edwardian suspicion of poverty as a moral failing rather than a socio-\n\neconomic condition. Even in the post-independence period, this punitive legacy\n\nhas endured in the anti-begging statutes of several Indian States, which often\n\npermit the arrest, detention, and forced confinement of persons merely on the\n\nbasis of appearance or circumstance, without commission of any substantive\n\noffence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_38\">16.2. In contrast, the Indian Constitutional framework post – 1950 marks a\n\ndecisive normative shift. The founding vision is explicitly welfare- centric,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">\f                                         14</span>\n\n\ncommitted to dismantling structural inequalities and ensuring the dignity of\n\nevery individual. This ethos is embodied in the Directive Principles of State\n\nPolicy – particularly <a href=\"/doc/1673816/\" id=\"a_8\">Article 38 (promoting welfare of the people)</a>, <a href=\"/doc/129471/\" id=\"a_9\">Article 39(e)\n\n(protecting workers’ health</a> and strength), <a href=\"/doc/1975922/\" id=\"a_10\">Article 41 (right to work</a>, education,\n\nand public assistance), and <a href=\"/doc/1551554/\" id=\"a_11\">Article 47 (raising the level of nutrition</a> and public\n\nhealth). Together, these provisions articulate the constitutional expectation of a\n\ncompassionate State, one that acts as a trustee of the well-being of the poor, the\n\nsick, and the destitute.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\">16.3. In this constitutional context, beggars’ homes cannot be conceived as\n\nquasi-penal facilities. Their role must be restorative, not retributive – places of\n\nrecovery, skill-building, and reintegration into society. The term “home” itself\n\ncarries semantic and normative weight: it denotes safety, dignity, belonging, and\n\ncare. Any arrangement that degenerates into a prison-like environment –\n\ncharacterised by overcrowding, unhygienic conditions, arbitrary or involuntary\n\nconfinement, denial of medical treatment, neglect of mental health needs, or\n\nrestrictions on personal liberty – is not merely a policy failure, but a\n\nconstitutional infraction striking at the very heart of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_12\">Article 21.</a>\n\n16.4. <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_13\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India, which guarantees the right to life\n\nand personal liberty, has been interpreted by this Court in an expansive and\n\npurposive manner. It is no longer confined to mere animal existence; it\n\nembraces within its fold the rights to dignity, health, shelter, privacy, and\n\nhumane treatment, with heightened protection for the most vulnerable groups.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">\f                                             15</span>\n\n\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"78536\" id=\"span_23\">In <a href=\"/doc/78536/\" id=\"a_14\">Francis Coralie Mullin v. Administrator, Union Territory of Delhi</a> 3, the\n\nCourt held:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">       “The right to life includes the right to live with human dignity and all that goes\n       along with it, namely, the bare necessaries of life such as adequate nutrition,\n       clothing and shelter…”\n\n\n\nThis judicial articulation leaves no doubt that the State’s responsibility towards\n\nindigent persons is affirmative and non-derogable. A beggars’ home, maintained\n\nby the State, is thus a constitutional trust, not a discretionary charity. Its\n\nadministration must reflect the values of constitutional morality – ensuring\n\nliberty, privacy, bodily autonomy, and dignified living conditions.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">16.5. This Court’s decision in Inhuman Conditions in 1382 Prisons, In Re 4\n\nprovides further normative guidance. Speaking in the context of prisons, the\n\nCourt observed that prisoners too are entitled to basic human rights, including\n\nthe right to live with dignity. The State has a duty to ensure that its institutions\n\ndo not function in a manner repugnant to constitutional morality.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">16.6. If such protections are owed to convicts and undertrials – individuals\n\nlawfully deprived of liberty pursuant to criminal conviction or prosecution – a\n\nfortiori, they must apply to residents of beggars’ homes, who are not offenders\n\nat all. Many are victims of structural poverty, mental illness, abandonment,\n\ndomestic violence, caste discrimination, or social exclusion. Their confinement,\n\n\n\n\n3 (1981) 1 SCC 608\n4 (2016) 3 SCC 700\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">\f                                        16</span>\n\n\nif necessary, at all, must be in the nature of protective custody accompanied by\n\ncomprehensive rehabilitation services, rather than coercive detention.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">16.7. In sum, the constitutional evaluation of beggars’ homes requires a\n\nparadigm shift – from viewing them as instruments of social control to\n\nrecognising them as spaces of social justice. The failure to ensure humane\n\nconditions in such homes does not merely amount to maladministration; it\n\nrepresents a constitutional breach of the fundamental right to life with dignity,\n\nthereby inviting judicial intervention. With the above principles in mind, we\n\nshall now delve into the facts of the present case.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">17.    At the outset, it is necessary to understand the scope, ambit, and purpose\n\nof the <a href=\"/doc/44602593/\" id=\"a_15\">Bombay Prevention of Begging Act, 1959</a> (in short, “BPBA”), as\n\nextended to the National Capital Territory of Delhi. Originally, enacted in\n\nMaharashtra, the BPBA has been adopted or adapted by several States and\n\nUnion Territories to regulate and control begging. Its enforcement, however,\n\nvaries significantly, across jurisdictions, and its constitutional validity has been\n\ntested on multiple occasions.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_40\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"88761484\" id=\"span_25\">17.1. Notably, in <a href=\"/doc/88761484/\" id=\"a_16\">Harsh Mander v. Union of India5</a>, the Delhi High Court\n\nstruck down certain provisions of the BPBA which criminalized begging,\n\nholding them to be violative of the fundamental rights guaranteed under the\n\nConstitution. Importantly, there is no central law uniformly governing begging\n\n\n5 AIR 2018 Del 188\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">\f                                        17</span>\n\n\nin India. The subject falls within the competence of both Union and State\n\nlegislatures, and is predominantly regulated through State or UT legislation.\n\n17.2. Several States and Union Territories have enacted their own laws\n\nmodelled substantially on the BPBA. These include:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">      <a href=\"/doc/33971071/\" id=\"a_17\">The Andhra Pradesh Prevention of Begging Act, 1977</a>\n      Assam Prevention of Begging Act, 1964\n      <a href=\"/doc/61392050/\" id=\"a_18\">The Bihar Prevention of Beggary Act, 1951</a>\n      <a href=\"/doc/124087979/\" id=\"a_19\">The Goa, Daman and Diu Prevention of Begging Act, 1972</a>\n      The Madhya Pradesh Biksha Vritti Nivaran Adhiniyam, 1973\n      <a href=\"/doc/189612908/\" id=\"a_20\">The Gujarat Prevention of Begging Act, 1959</a>\n      <a href=\"/doc/104319705/\" id=\"a_21\">The Haryana Prevention of Beggary Act, 1971</a>\n      <a href=\"/doc/192746893/\" id=\"a_22\">The Himachal Pradesh Prevention of Beggary Act, 1979</a>\n      <a href=\"/doc/73052980/\" id=\"a_23\">The Punjab Prevention of Beggary Act, 1971</a>\n      <a href=\"/doc/132270442/\" id=\"a_24\">The Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Beggary Act, 1975</a> (adopted by\n\n     Uttarakhand)\n    <a href=\"/doc/168106184/\" id=\"a_25\">The Karnataka Prohibition of Beggary Act, 1975</a>\n    <a href=\"/doc/56664537/\" id=\"a_26\">The Tamil Nadu Prevention of Begging Act, 1945</a> (earlier known as The\n\n     Madras Prevention of Begging Act, 1945)\n    <a href=\"/doc/189114953/\" id=\"a_27\">The Sikkim Prohibition of Beggary Act, 2004</a>\n    <a href=\"/doc/130298262/\" id=\"a_28\">The Bengal Vagrancy Act, 1943</a>\n    <a href=\"/doc/62828640/\" id=\"a_29\">The Jammu &amp; Kashmir Prevention of Beggary Act, 1960</a>.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">17.3. The State undeniably has a legitimate interest in maintaining public order,\n\nsafety, and cleanliness. Begging in public spaces may cause obstructions,\n\nharassment, and unsanitary conditions, thereby impacting citizens’ rights to\n\nmove freely and enjoy public areas. The BPBA provides a legal framework to\n\nidentify, care for, and rehabilitate persons who beg – many of whom are\n\nvulnerable due to poverty, disability, or social exclusion. <a href=\"/doc/44602593/\" id=\"a_30\">The Act</a> envisages their\n\nplacement in certified institutions, where they may receive shelter, food,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">\f                                        18</span>\n\n\nmedical treatment, and vocational training. In certain instances, begging also\n\nserves as a front for human trafficking, child labour, or organized exploitation,\n\nwarranting State intervention for the victims’ protection.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">17.4. <a href=\"/doc/156367222/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 4</a> of the BPBA empowers any police officer or authorized person\n\nto arrest, without warrant, anyone found begging, and to produce them before\n\nthe Court. Under <a href=\"/doc/58536319/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 5</a>, a summary inquiry is conducted by a Metropolitan\n\nMagistrate, and if the Court is not satisfied that the person was found begging,\n\nthey must be released forthwith. However, if found guilty, the Court shall order\n\ndetention in a certified institution for not less than one year and not more than\n\nthree years. For repeat offenders, <a href=\"/doc/130047677/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 6</a> provides for enhanced detention of\n\nup to 10 years, with a discretion to convert a portion of such detention, not\n\nexceeding two years, into a term of imprisonment.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">17.5. Pending inquiry or trial, detainees are housed at Reception-cum-\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_41\">Classification Centres (RCCs). In Delhi, the Department of Social Welfare /\n\nRehabilitation Services operates 11 certified custodial / residential institutions\n\nfor beggars, with a total capacity of 2,180 inmates. These institutions provide\n\nfood, lodging, medical care, recreation, counselling, and skill development\n\naimed at rehabilitating inmates and enabling them to give up begging. Presently,\n\nthree Courts are notified under the BPBA in Delhi – one at Sewa Kutir,\n\nKingsway Camp, and two Mobile Courts – assisted by three anti-begging\n\nsquads that conduct regular raids across the city. While such laws are necessary\n\nfor States to address begging as a social concern, maintain public order, and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">\f                                         19</span>\n\n\nfacilitate rehabilitation of vulnerable persons, their design and implementation\n\nmust conform to constitutional guarantees, uphold individual dignity, and reflect\n\nconstitutional morality, ensuring that regulation does not degenerate into the\n\ncriminalisation of poverty.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_42\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_43\">18.     The present case arises out of a grave and unfortunate incident at the\n\nBeggars’ Home, Lampur (Narela), where contamination of the drinking and\n\ncooking water with coliform bacteria resulted in an outbreak of cholera and\n\ngastroenteritis among the inmates. This outbreak led to multiple deaths and\n\nwidespread illness, exposing serious lapses in sanitation, hygiene, and\n\nhealthcare facilities within the institution. The incident has given rise to the\n\npresent public interest litigation, instituted at the behest of the appellant, seeking\n\naccountability,    systemic   reforms,    and   effective    safeguarding      of   the\n\nconstitutional rights of these highly vulnerable individuals.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_44\">19.

The appellant thereafter, filed an application before the High Court,\n\ncomplaining of non-compliance with the aforesaid order dated 15.10.2001.\n\nHowever, the High court, without going into the merits or passing a reasoned\n\norder, merely disposed of the application, granting liberty to the appellant to\n\napproach the appropriate forum if still aggrieved.

The records further reveal that a surprise inspection was most recently\n\nconducted on 29.03.2025 by Mrs. Vandana Arora, Senior Dietician, Dietetics\n\nDepartment, GTB Hospital, at the HLTB Centre, Tahirpur, Delhi, accompanied\n\nby the caretaker officer on duty and other staff members. The inspection noted\n\nthat the Centre was well-organized, neat, and clean. The inmates raised no\n\ncomplaints regarding either the quality or the quantity of food served. The daily\n\nmenu was found to be in conformity with the prescribed dietary protocol, with\n\nappropriate variations introduced to accommodate the food preferences of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">\f                                        36</span>\n\n\ninmates. A meal-checking register was being duly maintained by the Welfare\n\nOfficer on duty. The lunch preparation was also inspected and found\n\nsatisfactory. The report, however, recommended that a dedicated Dietician be\n\nrecruited or designated within the Department to ensure regular verification of\n\nfood quality and adherence to nutritional standards.\n\n22.18. From the foregoing, it is evident that this Court has from time to time,\n\nissued a series of directions aimed at improving the conditions prevailing in\n\nBeggars’ Homes, and that the concerned authorities have, by and large,\n\ncomplied therewith. The cumulative effect of these measures has been tangible\n\nimprovement in infrastructure, health facilities, diet, sanitation, and the overall\n\nliving conditions of the inmates. The most recent reports also record nil\n\ncomplaints from the inmates, with the sole recommendation being the\n\nappointment of a permanent Dietician. Thus, it stands established that the\n\nrespondents have duly complied with the order of the High Court dated\n\n15.10.2001 in its entirety.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_125\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_126\">23.   At the same time, we are of the considered view that the progress\n\nachieved should not remain confined to the Homes that were subject to scrutiny\n\nin the present case, but must extend to all Homes under the Government of NCT\n\nof Delhi. Moreover, all States and Union Territories are required to\n\ninstitutionalise similar reforms in Beggars’ Homes and analogous institutions\n\nunder their control, so that the constitutional guarantee of life with dignity is\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">\f                                       37</span>\n\n\nmeaningfully secured for this most vulnerable section of society. As already\n\nemphasised, Beggars’ Homes require a paradigm shift – from being perceived\n\nas instruments of social control to being recognised as spaces of social justice.\n\nThe failure to ensure humane conditions in such Homes does not merely amount\n\nto maladministration; it constitutes a constitutional breach of the fundamental\n\nright to life with dignity. Accordingly, we deem it appropriate to issue the\n\nfollowing directions, in respect of all Beggars’ Homes across the country,\n\nincluding the subject institutions to ensure that the improved conditions are\n\ncontinuously maintained.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_127\">I.
