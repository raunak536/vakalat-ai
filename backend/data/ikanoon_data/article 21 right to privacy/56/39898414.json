In this batch of matters, a scheme propounded by the\n\n     Government of India popularly known as “Aadhaar Card Scheme” is\n\n     under attack on various counts.

Suffice it to\n\nsay that under the said scheme the Government of India is collecting\n\nand compiling both the demographic and biometric data of the\n\nresidents of this country to be used for various purposes, the details of\n\nwhich are not relevant at present.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_2\">2.   One of the grounds of attack on the scheme is that the very\n\ncollection of such biometric data is violative of the “right to privacy”.\n\nSome of the petitioners assert that the right to privacy is implied\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India while other petitioners\n\nassert that such a right emanates not only from <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_2\">Article 21</a> but also\n\nfrom various other articles embodying the fundamental rights\n\nguaranteed under Part-III of the Constitution of India.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_3\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1306519\" id=\"span_8\">3.

Further, the learned Attorney\n\nGeneral also submitted that in a catena of decisions of this Court\n\nrendered subsequently, this Court referred to “right to privacy”,\n\ncontrary to the judgments in the abovementioned cases which resulted\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                                                        2</span>\n\fin a jurisprudentially impermissible divergence of judicial opinions.</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_4\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1306519\" id=\"span_10\">“A power of search and seizure is in any system of jurisprudence an\n     overriding power of the State for the protection of social security and\n     that power is necessarily regulated by law.

Therefore, it is submitted by the learned Attorney General and\n\nShri Venugopal that to settle the legal position, this batch of matters is\n\nrequired to be heard by a larger Bench of this Court as these matters\n\nthrow up for debate important questions – (i) whether there is any\n\n“right to privacy” guaranteed under our Constitution.                                               (ii) If such a\n\nright exists, what is the source and what are the contours of such a\n\nright as there is no express provision in the Constitution adumbrating\n\nthe right to privacy.                    It is therefore submitted that these batch of\n\nmatters are required to be heard and decided by a larger bench of at\n\nleast five Judges in view of the mandate contained under <a href=\"/doc/244297/\" id=\"a_13\">Article\n\n145(3)2</a> of the Constitution of India.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">1</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_9\">\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_10\">      A.M.

On behalf of the petitioners Shri Gopal Subramanium and Shri\n\nShyam Divan, learned senior counsel very vehemently opposed the\n\nsuggestion that this batch of matters is required to be heard by a\n\nlarger bench. According to them:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">(i)        The conclusions recorded by this Court in R. Rajagopal and\n\nPUCL are legally tenable for the reason that the observations made in\n\nM.P. Sharma regarding the absence of right to privacy under our\n\nConstitution are not part of ratio decidendi of that case and, therefore,\n\ndo not bind the subsequent smaller Benches.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"43475503\" id=\"span_21\">(ii)       Coming to the case of Kharak Singh, majority in Kharak Singh\n\ndid hold that the right of a person not to be disturbed at his residence\n\nby the State and its officers is recognized to be a part of a fundamental\n\nright guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_16\">Article 21</a> which is nothing but an aspect of\n\nprivacy. The observation in para 20 of the majority judgment at best\n\ncan be construed only to mean that there is no fundamental right of\n\nprivacy against the State’s authority to keep surveillance on the\n\nactivities of a person. Even such a conclusion cannot be good law any\n\nmore in view of the express declaration made by a seven-Judge bench\n\ndecision of this Court in                          <a href=\"/doc/43475503/\" id=\"a_17\">Maneka Gandhi v.

It is true that <a href=\"/doc/436241/\" id=\"a_22\">Gobind</a> (supra) did not make a clear declaration\n\nthat there is a right to privacy flowing from any of the fundamental\n\nrights guaranteed under Part-III of the Constitution of India, but\n\nobserved that “Therefore, even assuming that the right to personal liberty, the\n\nright to move freely throughout the territory of India and the freedom of speech\n\ncreate an independent right of privacy as an emanation from them which one can\n\ncharacterize as a fundamental right, we do not think that the right is absolute” .\n\nThis Court proceeded to decide the case on such basis.</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"501107\" id=\"span_29\">10. However, the subsequent decisions in <a href=\"/doc/501107/\" id=\"a_23\">R. Rajagopal</a> (supra) and\nmajority of the Judges took the view &quot;that &#x27;personal liberty&#x27; is used in the article as a compendious term to include within\nitself all the varieties of rights which go to make up the &#x27;personal liberties&#x27; of man other than those- dealt with in the\nseveral clauses of <a href=\"/doc/1142233/\" id=\"a_24\">Article 19(1).</a> In other words, while <a href=\"/doc/1142233/\" id=\"a_25\">Article 19(1)</a> deals with particular species or attributes, of that\nfreedom, &#x27;personal liberty&#x27; in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_26\">Article 21</a> takes in and comprises the residue&quot;. The minority judges, however, disagreed\nwith this view taken by the majority and explained their position in the following words: &quot;No doubt the expression\n&#x27;personal liberty&#x27; is a comprehensive one and the right to move freely is an attribute of personal liberty. It is said that the\nfreedom to move freely is carved out of personal liberty and, therefore, the expression &#x27;personal liberty&#x27; in\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_27\">Article 21</a> excludes that attribute. In our view, this is not a correct approach. Both are independent fundamental rights,\nthough there is overlapping. There is no question of one being carved out of another. The fundamental right of life and\npersonal liberty has many attributes and some of them are found in <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_28\">Article 19.</a> If a person&#x27;s fundamental right under\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_29\">Article 21</a> is infringed, the State can rely upon a law to sustain the action, but that cannot be a complete answer unless\nthe said law satisfies the test <a href=\"/doc/501107/\" id=\"a_30\">laid down in</a> <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_31\">Article 19(2)</a> so far as the attributes covered by <a href=\"/doc/1142233/\" id=\"a_32\">Article 19(1)</a> are concerned&quot;.</span>\nThere can be no doubt that in view of the decision of this Court in R. C. Cooper v. Union of India, (1970) 2 SCC 298 the\nminority view must be regarded as correct and the majority view must be held to have been overruled.\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">                                                                                                                             6</span>\n\f<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"31276692\" id=\"span_31\"><a href=\"/doc/31276692/\" id=\"a_33\">PUCL</a> (supra), the Benches were more categoric in asserting the\n\nexistence of “right to privacy”. While R. Rajagopal’s case4 held that\n\nthe “right to privacy” is implicit under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_34\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution,\n\nPUCL’s case held that the “right to privacy” insofar as it pertains to\n\nspeech is part of fundamental rights under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_35\">Articles 19(1)(a)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_36\">21</a> of\n\nthe Constitution5.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_16\">11. Elaborate submissions are made at the bar by the learned\n\ncounsel for the petitioners to demonstrate that world over in all the\n\ncountries where Anglo-Saxon jurisprudence is followed, ‘privacy’ is\n\nrecognised as an important aspect of the liberty of human beings. It is\n\nfurther submitted that it is too late in the day for the Union of India to\n\nargue that the Constitution of India does not recognise privacy as an\n\naspect of the liberty under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_37\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India. At\n\nleast to the extent that the right of a person to be secure in his house\n\nand not to be disturbed unreasonably by the State or its officers is\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">4</span>\n     Para 9. “Right to privacy is not enumerated as a fundamental right in our Constitution but has been inferred from\n    Article 21.”\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">5</span>\n    Para 18. “The right to privacy — by itself — has not been identified under the Constitution. As a concept it may be\ntoo broad and moralistic to define it judicially. Whether right to privacy can be claimed or has been infringed in a given\ncase would depend on the facts of the said case. But the right to hold a telephone conversation in the privacy of one’s\nhome or office without interference can certainly be claimed as “right to privacy”. Conversations on the telephone are\noften of an intimate and confidential character. Telephone conversation is a part of modern man’s life. It is considered so\nimportant that more and more people are carrying mobile telephone instruments in their pockets. Telephone conversation\nis an important facet of a man’s private life. Right to privacy would certainly include telephone conversation in the\nprivacy of one’s home or office. Telephone-tapping would, thus, infract <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_38\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India unless it is\npermitted under the procedure established by law.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_17\">         19. Right to freedom of speech and expression is guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_39\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution.

Shri Shyam Divan submitted that the biometric information\nof an individual can be circulated to other authorities or corporate\nbodies which, in turn can be used by them for commercial\nexploitation and, therefore, must be stopped.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">     The learned Attorney General pointed out, on the other hand,\nthat this Court has at no point of time, even while making the\ninterim order dated 23.9.2013 granted an injunction restraining the\nUnique Identification Authority of India from going ahead and\nobtaining biometric or other information from a citizen for the\npurpose of a Unique Identification Number, better known as\n“Aadhaar card”.   It was further submitted that the respondents\nhave gone ahead with the project and have issued Aadhaar cards to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_44\">                                                                  13</span>\n\fabout 90% of the population. Also that a large amount of money\nhas been spent by the Union Government on this project for issuing\nAadhaar cards and that in the circumstances, none of the\nwell-known consideration for grant of injunction are in favour of the\npetitioners.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">     The learned Attorney General stated that the respondents do\nnot share any personal information of an Aadhaar card holder\nthrough biometrics or otherwise with any other person or authority.\nThis statement allays the apprehension for now, that there is a\nwidespread breach of privacy of those to whom an Aadhaar card\nhas been issued.     It was further contended on behalf of the\npetitioners that there still is breach of privacy.   This is a matter\nwhich need not be gone into further at this stage.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">     The learned Attorney General has further submitted that the\nAadhaar card is of great benefit since it ensures an effective\nimplementation of several social benefit schemes of the Government\nlike MGNREGA, the distribution of food, ration and kerosene\nthrough PDS system and grant of subsidies in the distribution of\nLPG. It was, therefore, submitted that restraining the respondents\nfrom issuing further Aadhaar cards or fully utilising the existing\nAadhaar cards for the social schemes of the Government should be\nallowed.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">     The   learned   Attorney   General   further    stated   that   the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">                                                                      14</span>\n\frespondent Union of India would ensure that Aadhaar cards would\nonly be issued on a consensual basis after informing the public at\nlarge about the fact that the preparation of Aadhaar card involving\nthe parting of biometric information of the individual, which shall\nhowever not be used for any purpose other than a social benefit\nschemes.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">     Having considered the matter, we are of the view that the\nbalance of interest would be best served, till the matter is finally\ndecided by a larger Bench if the Union of India or the UIDA proceed\nin the following manner:-\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">1.   The Union of India shall give wide publicity in the electronic\nand print media including radio and television networks that it is\nnot mandatory for a citizen to obtain an Aadhaar card;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">2.

Shri Shyam Divan submitted that the\nbiometric information of an individual can be circulated to other\nauthorities or corporate bodies which, in turn can be used by\nthem for commercial exploitation and, therefore, must be stopped.\n</blockquote>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_70\">                                                                   23</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_71\">\f                             -8-</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_91\">     The learned Attorney General pointed out, on the other hand,\nthat this Court has at no point of time, even while making the\ninterim order dated 23.9.2013 granted an injunction restraining\nthe Unique Identification Authority of India from going ahead and\nobtaining biometric or other information from a citizen for the\npurpose of a Unique Identification Number, better known as\n“Aadhaar card”.   It was further submitted that the respondents\nhave gone ahead with the project and have issued Aadhaar cards to\nabout 90% of the population. Also that a large amount of money\nhas been spent by the Union Government on this project for\nissuing Aadhaar cards and that in the circumstances, none of the\nwell-known consideration for grant of injunction are in favour of\nthe petitioners.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_92\">     The learned Attorney General stated that the respondents do\nnot share any personal information of an Aadhaar card holder\nthrough biometrics or otherwise with any other person or\nauthority. This statement allays the apprehension for now, that\nthere is a widespread breach of privacy of those to whom an\nAadhaar card has been issued. It was further contended on behalf\nof the petitioners that there still is breach of privacy. This\nis a matter which need not be gone into further at this stage.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_93\">     The learned Attorney General has further submitted that the\nAadhaar card is of great benefit since it ensures an effective\nimplementation of several social benefit schemes of the\nGovernment like MGNREGA, the distribution of food, ration and\nkerosene through PDS system and grant of subsidies in the\ndistribution of LPG.       It was, therefore, submitted that\nrestraining the respondents from issuing further Aadhaar cards or\nfully utilising the existing Aadhaar cards for the social schemes\nof the Government should be allowed.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_94\">     The learned Attorney General further stated that the\nrespondent Union of India would ensure that Aadhaar cards would\nonly be issued on a consensual basis after informing the public\nat large about the fact that the preparation of Aadhaar card\ninvolving the parting of biometric information of the individual,\nwhich shall however not be used for any purpose other than a\nsocial benefit schemes.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_95\">     Having considered the matter, we are of the view that the\nbalance of interest would be best served, till the matter is\nfinally decided by a larger Bench if the Union of India or the\nUIDA proceed in the following manner:-\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_72\">                                                               24</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_73\">\f                             -9-</span>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_96\">1.

The production of an Aadhaar card will not be condition for\nobtaining any benefits otherwise due to a citizen;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_98\">3.
