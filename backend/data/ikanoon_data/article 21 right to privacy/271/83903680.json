It is stated that ISEC SERVICES PVT.

Thereupon, the Directorate of Enforcement has registered the ECIR\n                                 bearing no. ECIR/DLZO-I/28/2022 on 11.07.2022 allegations of\n                                 scheduled offences. Pursuant to the FIR, the CBI carried out search in\n                                 the office premises of ISEC and seized various articles and properties.\n                                 The CBI also carried out a search of the applicant and seized his\n                                 mobile phone. The ED arrested applicant on 19.07.2022 and the CBI\n                                 arrested the applicant on 24.09.2022.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">                          5.     The applicant states that in or around 2009, NSE approached ISEC\n                                 with a request to engage its services for analysis of calls that NSE was\n                                 recording of its employees. As per ISEC, NSE had been monitoring\n                                 calls from the landlines installed in its premises since 1997. As per the\n                                 proposal, NSE was to be provided a hard drive containing pre-\n                                 recorded call data of its employees and ISEC was required to listen to\n                                 the data provided by NSE on a weekly basis and submit a report to\n                                 NSE officials upon analysis thereof. The work required ISEC to flag\n                                 pre-recorded calls as &quot;suspicious&quot; based on their content and to\n                                 determine whether there were any system or process vulnerabilities.

Any leakage of sensitive information could potentially lead to\n                                 insider or unfair trading allowing persons to make illegal profits and\n                                 prejudicing the general public and investors.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_7\">                          6.     Mr. Akhil Sibal, learned senior counsel, has stated that there is an\n                                 inherent fallacy in the registration of FIR. The FIR is premised on the\n                                 fact that the action of ISEC as well as the applicant in recording of\n                                 calls is illegal. He states that there is no prohibition in law restraining\n                                 the NSE from recording conversations made on the land lines owned\n                                 by them and in their premises. He states that there is no dishonest\n                                 intention by ISEC as call recording was being done by NSE prior to\n                                 2009. He states that in 2009, services of ISEC were utilized for pre-\n                                 existing arrangement of monitoring and analysis of the calls. The\n                                 applicant entered into a duly signed contract wherein Rs. 4.5 crores\n                                 were paid for the services rendered by ISEC on which the applicant\n                                 has duly paid tax. He states that it is not a prohibited activity and the\n                                 NSE was doing it since 1997. Mr Sibal has taken me through the\n                                 statements of Mr Mahesh Haldipur and Ms. Suguna Pappaiah in this\n                                 regard.

But where\n                                    the allegation is that a person has dishonestly induced another\n                                    to part with property something different has to be considered\n                                    and that is whether he has thereby caused a wrongful loss to\n                                    the person who parted with property or has made a wrongful\n                                    gain to himself. These are the two facets of the definition of\n                                    dishonesty and it is enough to establish the existence of one of\n                                    them.

It was urged that the scheduled offence in a given case\n                                    may be a non cognizable offence and yet rigors of Section 45 of\n                                    the 2002 Act would result in denial of bail even to such\n                                    accused. This argument is founded on clear misunderstanding\n                                    of the scheme of the 2002 Act. As we have repeatedly mentioned\n                                    in the earlier part of this judgment that the offence of money-\n                                    laundering is one wherein a person, directly or indirectly,\n                                    attempts to indulge or knowingly assists or knowingly is a party\n                                    or is actually involved in any process or activity connected with\n                                    the proceeds of crime. The fact that the proceeds of crime have\n                                    been generated as a result of criminal activity relating to a\n                                    scheduled offence, which incidentally happens to be a\n                                    noncognizable offence, would make no difference. The person is\n                                    not prosecuted for the scheduled offence by invoking provisions\n                                    of the 2002 Act, but only when he has derived or obtained\n                                    property as a result of criminal activity relating to or in\n                                    relation to a scheduled offence and then indulges in process or\n                                    activity connected with such proceeds of crime. Suffice it to\n                                    observe that the argument under consideration is completely\n                                    misplaced and needs to be rejected.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_126\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_127\">Digitally Signed byAMIT   BAIL APPLN. 2409/2022                                             Page 25 of 48</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_128\">ARORA</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_129\">Signing Date:08.12.2022</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_130\">14:31:26</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_47\">                           ANALYSIS:-\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_48\">                          27.

It is alleged that\n                                 these acts constitute the underlying scheduled offences. The\n                                 Enforcement Directorate alleges that the revenue of Rs. 4.54 crores\n                                 generated by ISEC for providing such services constitutes the\n                                 „proceeds of crime‟ and therefore alleges commission of the offence\n                                 of money laundering punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1927191/\" id=\"a_74\">Section 4</a> of the PMLA.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_50\">                          29.

As per the agreed arrangement\n                                 between NSE and ISEC, NSE would provide ISEC with a hard drive\n                                 (on a weekly basis) which contained the pre-recorded call data that\n                                 ISEC was to analyse. ISEC would conclude its analysis and submit its\n                                 weekly report to the NSE.

This is a case where the NSE, which is a private company, engaged\n                                 ISEC to perform a service. Payments were made in lieu of receipt of\n                                 such services. ISEC duly showed amounts in tax returns and paid\n                                 income tax on said income. Therefore, I find merit in the petitioner‟s\n                                 submission that contractual compensation of Rs. 4.54 crores for\n                                 services rendered cannot amount to a &quot;pecuniary advantage&quot; in terms\n                                 of the <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_184\">PC Act</a>.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_90\">                          68.    No call recordings were ever entrusted to the Applicant on account of\n                                 his capacity as a „public servant‟. The Applicant was a director of\n                                 ISEC only from 2003 till 17.05.2006.
