The comparison as submitted by the learned Senior counsel for\n\n                  the petitioner between <a href=\"/doc/690830/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 17</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1093594/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 19</a> in no terms can be\n\n                  entertained as the grounds and powers of arrest is completely different from\n\n                  search and seizure as contemplated under <a href=\"/doc/690830/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 17</a> of the Act. Arrest is\n\n                  deprivation of one’s right to personal liberty, whereas in search and seizure,\n\n                  the scope is tested vis-a-vis right to privacy and freedom of movement. So a\n\n                  tabular comparison of these both Sections cannot yield justice to the\n\n                  legislative intent set out under both these Sections. Arrest is several\n\n                  notches higher when compared to a search conducted. The intent itself\n\n                  differs, hence the principles as envisaged under <a href=\"/doc/1093594/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 19</a> cannot find\n\n                  place under <a href=\"/doc/690830/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 17</a>.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_43\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_44\">                            18.

Going by the observations made in the concurring judgment\n\n                  rendered by Justice Bela Trivedi, this Court is of the opinion that when the\n\n                  parameters of arrest itself is as much as only to ensure the recording of\n\n                  reasons to believe in writing and not to go further into scrutiny of sufficiency\n\n                  or adequacy of materials based on which belief is formed, then here the\n\n                  threshold of <a href=\"/doc/690830/\" id=\"a_54\">Section 17</a> search being much lesser than arrest, then the only\n\n                  point of scrutiny by Courts is to ensure whether procedure of &#x27;reasons to\n\n                  believe&#x27; to be recorded in writing is complied with or not. And such reason to\n\n                  believe must be formed based on some information in possession. And in\n\n                  the absence of any malafideness there is no need for further scrutiny by the\n\n                  Court at this nascent stage.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_61\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                                                                                                    Page 16 of 66</span>\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis                ( Uploaded on: 23/04/2025 11:46:17 am )\n\f                                                                             W.P.Nos.10348, 10352 &amp; 10355 of 2025\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_62\">                            28. Therefore, the Courts need not go into the merits or scrutinies the\n\n                  reasons. The fact that the authority had recorded the reasons to believe in\n\n                  writing as explicitly mandated under <a href=\"/doc/690830/\" id=\"a_55\">Section 17</a> based on information in\n\n                  possession is sufficient to conduct search. Sufficiency or adequacy of the\n\n                  information cannot be gone into by the Court at this stage of search and\n\n                  seizure which involves collection and gathering of evidence.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_63\">                            29. This point further finds agreement on the premise that the object\n\n                  of conducting search itself is to gather evidence, then how can there be a\n\n                  precondition that the ED should be in possession of credible material\n\n                  evidence before conducting search. That would defeat the object of search\n\n                  under <a href=\"/doc/690830/\" id=\"a_56\">Section 17</a>. It is only after a search is conducted that credible\n\n                  evidence be gathered to establish the offence of money laundering. If the\n\n                  DoE has all the relevant material evidence even before conducting the\n\n                  search then there is no requirement to conduct such search operation at all.\n\n                  Hence the requirement of actual material evidence before forming reasons\n\n                  to believe as contemplated under <a href=\"/doc/1093594/\" id=\"a_57\">Section 19</a> cannot be accorded to <a href=\"/doc/690830/\" id=\"a_58\">Section\n\n                  17</a> of PMLA.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_64\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_65\">                            30.

This Court\n\n                  did not go into the merits of the reasons but merely verified whether the\n\n                  reasons to believe authorising the search is recorded in writing and after\n\n                  being satisfied with the same returned the sealed cover to the Learned\n\n                  Special Public Prosecutor appearing for DoE.

On examination of <a href=\"/doc/690830/\" id=\"a_67\">Section\n\n                  17</a>, there is no explicit procedure stipulated that the copy of reasons to\n\n                  believe must be served on the person on whom search is conducted.

Suffice it to observe that ECIR\n                                  cannot be equated with an FIR which is mandatorily\n                                  required to be recorded and supplied to the accused\n                                  as per the provisions of 1973 Code. Revealing a copy\n                                  of an ECIR, if made mandatory, may defeat the\n                                  purpose sought to be achieved by the 2002 Act\n                                  including   frustrating    the     attachment           of   property\n                                  (proceeds of crime). Non-supply of ECIR, which is\n                                  essentially an internal document of ED, cannot be\n                                  cited as violation of constitutional right. Concededly,\n                                  the person arrested, in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1093594/\" id=\"a_77\">Section 19</a> of the 2002\n                                  Act, is contemporaneously made aware about the\n                                  grounds of his arrest. This is compliant with the\n                                  mandate of <a href=\"/doc/1293832/\" id=\"a_78\">Article 22(1)</a> of the Constitution. It is not\n                                  unknown that at times FIR does not reveal all aspects\n                                  of the offence in question. In several cases, even the\n                                  names of persons actually involved in the commission\n                                  of offence are not mentioned in the FIR and described\n                                  as unknown accused. Even, the particulars as\n                                  unfolded are not fully recorded in the FIR. Despite\n                                  that, the accused named in any ordinary offence is\n                                  able to apply for anticipatory bail or regular bail, in\n                                  which proceeding, the police papers are normally\n                                  perused by the concerned Court.

But\n\n                  these are unavoidable delays and our general public bears with it. But here\n\n                  an entire government machinery has come forward to file a writ petition\n\n                  stating that a few public officers were made to wait for hours in their offices,\n\n                  which we believe has adequate facilities and definitely has basic human\n\n                  necessities. And moreover this Court is of the view that it is the duty of the\n\n                  TASMAC officials to cooperate with the investigating agencies. In fact they\n\n                  should be more inclined to cooperate with the investigation to get rid of any\n\n                  such corruption or money laundering that might have happened. That is the\n\n                  duty of every public servant. Instead making such flimsy arguments is\n\n                  unpalatable. Our country also sees the operation of <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_88\">Criminal Procedure\n\n                  Code</a> where search and seizure provisions find place. But we don’t see\n\n                  much litigations where general public states that there fundamental rights\n\n                  are affected during search by local police or other State investigating\n\n                  agencies. That doesn’t mean that there is no such violation but it is just that\n\n                  common man considers it his duty to cooperate with the Police. But it is only\n\n                  in offences of high economic transactions like money laundering that even\n\n                  for a basic exercise of searching a building does all forms of litigation\n\n                  alleging violation of fundamental rights crops in. And even a normal search\n\n                  is made to look like all hell broke loose.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_112\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">                                                                                                  Page 33 of 66</span>\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis              ( Uploaded on: 23/04/2025 11:46:17 am )\n\f                                                                            W.P.Nos.10348, 10352 &amp; 10355 of 2025\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_113\">                            57. Also, this Court is unable to understand as to why the State of\n\n                  Tamil Nadu and the TASMAC had chosen to file this writ petition. The\n\n                  aggrieved could have filed individual writ petitions if their fundamental rights\n\n                  are under threat. But the Tamil Nadu government has filed the writ petition\n\n                  stating that their employees were harassed. Normally it is the individuals\n\n                  aggrieved who approach the Court. Neither the Tamil Nadu Government nor\n\n                  TASMAC are the aggrieved party here. It is shocking that a State\n\n                  Government filed a petition stating that they have been aggrieved. How can\n\n                  a peoples’ government be aggrieved because of a search operation\n\n                  conducted in one government owned company? In fact the search operation\n\n                  was conducted to unearth any case of money laundering, if any and to\n\n                  ensure a corruption free operation of TASMAC for which the State\n\n                  government must cooperate with the investigation agency. This raises\n\n                  questions as to whether this present petition was filed to obstruct the\n\n                  smooth conduct of the investigation. The fallacy in the submissions made\n\n                  raises several doubts.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_114\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_115\">                            58.

Also the\n\n                  prayer sought for is shocking whereby the Government of Tamil Nadu has\n\n                  sought for “to Direct the respondents not to enter into and exercise any\n\n                  power of search and seizure in terms of <a href=\"/doc/690830/\" id=\"a_89\">Section 17</a> of PML Act at any\n\n                  premises of the government of the State of Tamil Nadu be it any office of\n\n                  any Corporation under it as well”.

On examination of facts and materials available on record, this\n\n                  Court finds it unfortunate that women officers and employees are used as\n\n                  shields to prevent investigations from proceeding. Courts have time and\n\n                  again stressed on gender equality in public service. Women are far more\n\n                  empowered and are more proactive nowadays especially in public service.\n\n                  We see women progressing across different fields. We have women\n\n                  officers in Army, Navy and Air Force ready to defend our country under all\n\n                  situations. We see women parliamentarians stay throughout the night in the\n\n                  Houses of Parliament to take part in discussions on bills and pass\n\n                  legislation for the benefit of the people of our Great Nation. We see women\n\n                  IAS and IPS officers working tirelessly day and night especially during\n\n                  exigencies and emergencies. Women doctors and nurses during COVID-19\n\n                  worked round the clock even in night shifts to save lives. Across three\n\n                  pillars of governance women are showing their capabilities and rising to the\n\n                  occasion. Let not a government discourage and dis-empower women\n\n                  especially those in public service. We should not underestimate the\n\n                  capabilities of women. It is the duty of public officials to aid and assist in\n\n                  investigations and it is also the responsibility of both the investigation\n\n                  agencies and State Government officials in-charge to protect and ensure\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_53\">                                                                                                     Page 41 of 66</span>\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis                 ( Uploaded on: 23/04/2025 11:46:17 am )\n\f                                                                                 W.P.Nos.10348, 10352 &amp; 10355 of 2025\n\n                  the safety of women.

But let not a government try to discourage a woman\n\n                  from moving towards the path of empowerment. We must get rid of the age\n\n                  old stereotypes and ensure a level playing field for women.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_135\">                            66.

On conclusion, this Court feels that there is a strong\n\n                  disconnection between the averments and the relief sought for in the writ\n\n                  petition. It is imperative that a broader view of the issue needs to be taken at\n\n                  times, where the rights of people at large will be affected. It is without doubt\n\n                  that the prima facie allegations and complaints against the Tamil Nadu\n\n                  State Marketing Corporation (TASMAC) are grave in nature. It definitely\n\n                  warrants deeper investigation. But these present writ petitions are filed\n\n                  challenging the very initial step of search conducted based on certain\n\n                  information on record. To find out the truthfulness in the allegations, the\n\n                  primary step is to conduct a search, gathering evidences available and then\n\n                  the natural course of investigation shall progress based on the materials\n\n                  gathered. If there is some evidence, automatically the investigation gains\n\n                  momentum else the Investigating Agency drops all further action. But to\n\n                  even come out with an argument that conducting a search itself is\n\n                  harassment, this is challenging the very foundation of criminal justice\n\n                  system. How can a State Government would file a writ petition stating that\n\n                  an Investigating Agency cannot enter and conduct a search in a\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_70\">                                                                                                 Page 57 of 66</span>\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis             ( Uploaded on: 23/04/2025 11:46:17 am )\n\f                                                                            W.P.Nos.10348, 10352 &amp; 10355 of 2025\n\n                  Government Company, that too when allegations are so serious in nature.\n\n                  In fact, it is the Tamil Nadu Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption,\n\n                  which has registered multiple First Information Reports (F.I.Rs) regarding\n\n                  malpractices of corruption ongoing in TASMAC.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_179\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_180\">                            90. Further, the argument that there must be a precondition of getting\n\n                  the consent from the State Government before conducting searches is\n\n                  completely illogical and bereft of conscience. How can a raid or search be\n\n                  conducted in a State Government owned company in a surprise manner if\n\n                  permission is to be obtained beforehand. How can a search by an\n\n                  investigating agency even hold good if such absurd conditions are made. It\n\n                  is against basic principles of criminal justice system. It is common\n\n                  understanding that on commission of any crime, a search is conducted to\n\n                  gather evidence and other relevant materials viable for investigation to\n\n                  progress. Similarly in cases involving PMLA offences, there is the offence of\n\n                  money laundering involved and searches have to be conducted to seize\n\n                  digital evidences and other records in pursuit of the offence. More so in\n\n                  money laundering case, the crime modus is often through digital medium\n\n                  and devices have to be seized to check and trace the movement of money\n\n                  and the nature of laundering can be deduced only through the study of such\n\n                  digital evidences. Moreover, TASMAC is a State owned company and\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_71\">                                                                                                   Page 58 of 66</span>\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis               ( Uploaded on: 23/04/2025 11:46:17 am )\n\f                                                                             W.P.Nos.10348, 10352 &amp; 10355 of 2025\n\n                  getting prior consent of the State government is an endeavour which may\n\n                  not successful. On paper, it is a good argument but practically, a reasonable\n\n                  man can be sure that the State government will not consent to an\n\n                  investigating agency conducting searches in their own company.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_181\">                            91. It is by anticipating such procedural and technical difficulties that\n\n                  PMLA has inbuilt within itself a mechanism to investigate and cull out the\n\n                  perpetrators holding such proceeds of crime. This Court is of the view that\n\n                  the Petitioners are embarking on a mission to defeat the very core of PMLA\n\n                  and criminal justice system. <a href=\"/doc/1658551/\" id=\"a_148\">Section 1</a> of PMLA clearly states that the Act\n\n                  extends to the whole of India. The concept of federalism cannot be applied\n\n                  here. Our Constitution is quasi federal in nature but the traces of federalism\n\n                  is applied only for the benefit of the people and not to their detriment. PMLA\n\n                  are legislation to prevent crimes affecting National economic growth. How\n\n                  can concept of federalism be argued in cases concerning offences against\n\n                  National economy. This Court is of the view that the argument of federalism\n\n                  in Special Criminal Legislation like PMLA is untenable and unjustifiable.\n\n                  Federalism though present in limited doses in our Constitution should be\n\n                  utilised only in issues concerning upliftment of the people and not to prevent\n\n                  investigation into crimes or offences which are committed against the Nation\n\n                  and its people.

A raid or a search by an investigating agency must be discreetly\n\n                  planned and executed to ensure that the offenders are caught off guard. In\n\n                  the present case, it is argued that the petitioner employees were asked to\n\n                  stay and that their mobile phones were seized and hence they were unable\n\n                  to contact their family. But that is how normally a surprise check is\n\n                  conducted. How can an investigating agency conduct a fair and safe search\n\n                  if all the employees are allowed to leave the premises. Any reasonable man\n\n                  would know that if the employees are allowed to go, there is high chance of\n\n                  destruction or concealment of evidence, which would defeat the very\n\n                  purpose of such a search. It is a due process of law, which is well within the\n\n                  ambit of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_149\">Article 21</a>, that the employees be detained to prevent any untoward\n\n                  methods that may be aimed to sabotage the investigation. This cannot be\n\n                  termed as harassment. Moreover there arises a relevant question as to\n\n                  even going by the petitioner&#x27;s averment that this is harassment, the relief\n\n                  sought for in the present petition is incommensurate with this argument. The\n\n                  petition alleges that few officers were harassed as they were detained\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_73\">                                                                                                   Page 60 of 66</span>\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis               ( Uploaded on: 23/04/2025 11:46:17 am )\n\f                                                                             W.P.Nos.10348, 10352 &amp; 10355 of 2025\n\n                  during a search, but the relief sought for is to direct the respondents not to\n\n                  enter and conduct search at any premises of Government of Tamil Nadu.\n\n                  How can such a petition even be maintainable. If there are charges of\n\n                  harassment, how can one file a petition to state that a search must be\n\n                  declared illegal and that in essence prohibits any future searches as well.\n\n                  This is highly alarming and such petitions ought to be dismissed at\n\n                  threshold. It raises pertinent question as to the intention behind filing such\n\n                  writ petitions, whether is it a strategy to prolong and protract the\n\n                  investigation is a legitimate query that arises.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_184\">                            93. It is without doubt that any structural system in a country with a\n\n                  humongous population as ours struggles with certain unavoidable delays\n\n                  and inconveniences. But can we throw away an entire system for the same.\n\n                  It is impractical to expect a highly comfortable and pleasant ambience for\n\n                  anybody who has to comply with the laws of a country. Laws are made to\n\n                  ensure an order in a society and prevent chaos. It is a by-product that in the\n\n                  pursuit of compliance with such laws there is bound to be some\n\n                  inconvenience for the people. Similarly in legislations where investigation by\n\n                  an authorised agency is one of its facet, inconveniences are bound to arise,\n\n                  but it is expected that fullest cooperation is rendered to ensure that a fair\n\n                  and speedy justice is delivered. But it is unfortunate that in the present case,\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_74\">                                                                                                    Page 61 of 66</span>\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis                ( Uploaded on: 23/04/2025 11:46:17 am )\n\f                                                                          W.P.Nos.10348, 10352 &amp; 10355 of 2025\n\n                  a mere search was conducted and the petitioners with complete whimsical\n\n                  arguments have approached this Court seeking for declaring the search\n\n                  itself as illegal. It is agonising that public servants who ought to work for the\n\n                  welfare of the people, have approached this Court stating that they were\n\n                  detained by an investigating agency while conducting a search and that this\n\n                  amounts harassment. How can a procedure established by law be termed\n\n                  as harassment. This is a challenge to the very ethos of criminal justice\n\n                  system.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_185\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_186\">                            94. If this court accepts that such a search conducted by an\n\n                  investigating agency is harassment, then it can lead to a floodgate of\n\n                  litigations where each and every citizen of this country bound by the rule of\n\n                  law start alleging harassment on every procedure detailed under our\n\n                  criminal procedure system. Thousands of litigants in this country wait for\n\n                  years with patience praying for Justice which is their constitutional right. But\n\n                  it is unfortunate that the government officers who are public servants cannot\n\n                  tolerate a few hours of detention to ensure a smooth investigation to be\n\n                  conducted. In fact it is their condition of service that they cooperate with any\n\n                  such lawful investigation conducted in their office premises. The officers\n\n                  nowhere have alleged any physical torture.

Also the offence of money laundering is a crime against the\n\n                  people of our Nation. The arguments of officers being detained for hours\n\n                  during search and that the employees being sent home at odd hours when a\n\n                  search is in progress is inadequate and highly disproportional, when\n\n                  compared to the rights of millions of people of our Great Nation. The search\n\n                  conducted is for the interest and benefit of this Nation.

It is the mandate of the Constitution to secure to all\n\n                  its citizens Economic Justice.
