As a result of\n\ntheir growing proximity, they entered into physical relations with each\n\nother but both of them parted ways later. Petitioner is a student of 12th\n\nStandard and during her ongoing Board examinations, she felt pain in\n\nher abdomen for which she was diagnosed by the doctors of Rajindra\n\nHospital, Patiala to be pregnant. Petitioner is under immense pressure for\n\nhaving conceived a child when she herself is of tender age and is a\n\nstudent appearing in her 10+2 Board Examinations. She is apprehensive\n\nthat her entire career and future prospects shall suffer a huge set back in\n\ncase the pregnancy is not permitted to be terminated at this stage. She is\n\nherself of a tender age and is not mentally prepared to give birth. The\n\nunwanted pregnancy shall subject her to enhanced social stigma and\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                                                                 2</span>\n                                  2 of 65\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">               ::: Downloaded on - 13-03-2024 04:05:45 :::</span>\n                                                      Neutral Citation No:=2024:PHHC:033861\n\n\n\n\nCWP-4885-2024 (O&amp;M).                       -3-\n2024:PHHC:033861\n\n\nincarceration. A prayer is thus made for being granted permission for\n\ntermination of the pregnancy by relying on the judgment of the Hon&#x27;ble\n\nSupreme Court in the matter of <a href=\"/doc/1500783/\" id=\"a_2\">Suchita Srivastava and another Vs.\n\nChandigarh Administration</a>, reported as (2009) 9 SCC 1. The relevant\n\npart of the judgment is extracted as under:-</span>\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">                   &quot;There is no doubt that a woman&#x27;s right to make\n             reproductive choices is also a dimension of `personal\n             liberty&#x27; as understood under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_3\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution\n             of India. It is important to recognise that reproductive\n             choices can be exercised to procreate as well as to abstain\n             from procreating. The crucial consideration is that a\n             woman&#x27;s right to privacy, dignity and bodily integrity\n             should be respected. This means that there should be no\n             restriction whatsoever on the exercise of reproductive\n             choices such as a woman&#x27;s right to refuse participation in\n             sexual activity or alternatively the insistence on use of\n             contraceptive methods. Furthermore, women are also free\n             to choose birth-control methods such as undergoing\n             sterilisation procedures. Taken to their logical conclusion,\n             reproductive rights include a woman&#x27;s entitlement to carry\n             a pregnancy to its full term, to give birth and to\n             subsequently raise children.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_7\">4            Considering that a legal issue is involved as to whether the\n\npermission for termination of the pregnancy can be granted at this\n\njuncture or not, counsel for the respondent-State made a statement that\n\nthere is no need to file reply and that they shall advance arguments on\n\nthe petition itself. Additionally, Sh. Vivek Saini, Advocate was also\n\nappointed as Amicus by this Court to assist in the matter.\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                                                               3</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">                                 3 of 65\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">              ::: Downloaded on - 13-03-2024 04:05:45 :::</span>\n                                                      Neutral Citation No:=2024:PHHC:033861\n\n\n\n\nCWP-4885-2024 (O&amp;M).                       -4-\n2024:PHHC:033861\n\n\n5            When the matter came up for preliminary hearing, vide\n\norder dated 29.02.2024, the respondent-State of Punjab was directed to\n\nconstitute a Medical Board to carry out physical examination of the\n\npetitioner and submit its report as regards the mental, physical and\n\npsychological status of the petitioner.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_9\">\n6            The petitioner appeared before the said Medical Board and\n\na report was received from the Centre Administrator.

The case of the\n\npetitioner does not fall under any of the said categories.\n\n\n18           He relies upon the report submitted by the Medical Board of\n\nthe PGIMER as per which the foetus is of 26 weeks and there is no\n\ncongenital malformation and that the patient as well as the child were\n\nboth healthy. It was also contended by the Medical Board that chances of\n\nneo-natal survival are around 60 to 65 % and that the foetus is likely to\n\nbe born alive and a pre-mature forced delivery is likely to cause severe\n\nneuro-development handicap in the long run rendering the child\n\ndependent for the rest of his life.

Such feticide is although recognized,\n\nwhere a foetus has abnormal development, but the same is usually not\n\nresorted to for a normal foetus. The said matter was put up before a\n\nmedical board of 09 doctors of AIIMS and its report was received, which\n\nreported that there was no abnormality in the foetus and that the medical\n\ncomplications faced by the mother could be tackled and taken care of by\n\nproper medication.

The law recognizes the exercise of sexual autonomy by an\n\nindividual as an integral part of an inviolate right conferred under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_40\">Article\n\n21</a> of the Constitution of India and is embodied in her right to life and\n\nfor protection of her bodily integrity.

An unmarried girl or a\n\nwoman, who exercises her right to sexual autonomy, cannot be put to\n\nprejudice and be denied her consideration for seeking medical\n\ntermination of pregnancy which such right is recognized for a married\n\nwoman.

To be sure, there are\n         some indigenous groups within our country wherein sexual\n         relations outside the marital setting are accepted as a\n         normal occurrence. Even in the societal mainstream, there\n         are a significant number of people who see nothing wrong\n         in engaging in premarital sex. Notions of social morality\n         are inherently subjective and the criminal law cannot be\n         used as a means to unduly interfere with the domain of\n         personal autonomy.

The predominant understanding of the concept of a\n         &quot;family&quot; both in the law and in society is that it consists of a\n         single, unchanging unit with a mother and a father (who\n         remain constant over time) and their children. This\n         assumption ignores both, the many circumstances which\n         may lead to a change in one&#x27;s familial structure, and the\n         fact that many families do not conform to this expectation to\n         begin with. Familial relationships may take the form of\n         domestic, unmarried partnerships or queer relationships.

These manifestations of love and of\n         families may not be typical but they are as real as their\n         traditional counterparts. Such atypical manifestations of the\n         family unit are equally deserving not only of protection\n         under law but also of the benefits available under social\n         welfare legislation.

The common thread running through each category of\n         women mentioned in Rule 3B is that the woman is in a\n         unique and often difficult circumstance, with respect to her\n         physical, mental, social, or financial state. All the different\n         categories in Rule 3B represent women who seek an\n         abortion after twenty weeks either due to a delay in\n         recognizing pregnancy, or some other change in their\n         environment impacting their decision on whether the\n         pregnancy is wanted or unwanted. The law recognizes the\n         myriad ways in which a pregnancy may cause distress in\n         such situations and cause grave injury to her physical and\n         mental health. It gives such women latitude in seeking out\n         the termination of an unwelcome pregnancy by extending\n         the gestational period up to which the termination is legally\n         permissible.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_132\">                                                                         43</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_73\">                            43 of 65\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_133\">          ::: Downloaded on - 13-03-2024 04:05:45 :::</span>\n                                                  Neutral Citation No:=2024:PHHC:033861\n\n\n\n\nCWP-4885-2024 (O&amp;M).                    -44-\n2024:PHHC:033861\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_74\">         70. Rule 3B(a) is based on an acknowledgement of the\n         reality that survivors of sexual assault, rape, or incest may\n         face immense stigma if and when they share the fact of their\n         assault with others, including family members. It is no\n         secret that a culture of shame surrounds sexual violence in\n         India. Survivors are often hesitant to speak about the\n         violence inflicted upon them. This is doubly the case with\n         victims of incestuous sexual assault or rape, whose close\n         relatives abuse their power and authority over the\n         woman and       other     family   members     oftentimes   being\n         unwilling to believe that the perpetrator (that is to say, their\n         relative) is guilty of sexual violence. Many survivors,\n         including minors, may not even be aware that pregnancy is\n         a possible consequence of rape. Hence, the delay in\n         revealing the fact that a man has raped them may lead to a\n         delay in discovering the pregnancy. Alternatively, the\n         woman in question may be unable to access medical\n         facilities in a timely fashion and may therefore find herself\n         unable to terminate the pregnancy before the completion of\n         twenty weeks.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_75\">               xxx    xxx        xxx\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_76\">         81.

For\n         instance, it is not unheard of for a woman to realise that she\n         is pregnant only after the passage of twenty weeks, [88]\n         Other examples are if a woman loses her job and is no\n         longer financially secure, or if domestic violence is\n         perpetrated against her, [89] or if she suddenly has\n         dependents to support.

If Rule 3B(c) was to be interpreted such\n         that its benefits extended only to married women, it would\n         perpetuate the stereotype and socially held notion that only\n         married women indulge in sexual intercourse, and that\n         consequently, the benefits in law ought to extend only to\n         them.

This\n         decision is intimately linked to wider political, social, and\n         economic structures. A woman&#x27;s role and status in family,\n         and society generally, is often tied to childbearing and\n         ensuring the continuation of successive generations.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_89\">         [90 ZAKIYA LUNA, REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS AS\n         HUMAN RIGHTS: WOMEN OF COLOR AND FIGHT\n         FOR REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE (NYU Press, 2020))\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_90\">         98. To this, we may add that a woman is often enmeshed in\n         complex notions of family, community, religion, and caste.\n         Such external societal factors affect the way a woman\n         exercises autonomy and control over her body, particularly\n         in matters relating to reproductive decisions. Societal\n         factors often find reinforcement by way of legal barriers\n         restricting a woman&#x27;s right to access abortion. The decision\n         to have or not to have an abortion is borne out of\n         complicated life circumstances, which only the woman can\n         choose on her own terms without external interference or\n         influence.

The right to reproductive autonomy is closely linked\n         with the right to bodily autonomy. As the term itself\n         suggests, bodily autonomy is the right to take decisions\n         about one&#x27;s body. The consequences of an unwanted\n         pregnancy on a woman&#x27;s body as well as her mind cannot\n         be understated. The foetus relies on the pregnant woman&#x27;s\n         body for sustenance and nourishment until it is born. The\n         biological process of pregnancy transforms the woman&#x27;s\n         body to permit this. The woman may experience swelling,\n         body ache, contractions, morning sickness, and restricted\n         mobility, to name a few of a host of side effects. Further,\n         complications may arise which pose a risk to the life of the\n         woman. A mere description of the side effects of a\n         pregnancy cannot possibly do justice to the visceral image\n         of forcing a woman to continue with an unwanted\n         pregnancy. Therefore, the decision to carry the pregnancy\n         to its full term or terminate it is firmly rooted in the right to\n         bodily autonomy and decisional autonomy of the pregnant\n         woman.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_93\">         100. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"91938676\" id=\"span_145\">In <a href=\"/doc/91938676/\" id=\"a_115\">K.

Privacy postulates the reservation of a private space\n         for the individual, described as the right to be let alone. The\n         concept is founded on the autonomy of the individual. The\n         ability of an individual to make choices lies at the core of\n         the human personality. The notion of privacy enables the\n         individual to assert and control the human element which is\n         inseparable from the personality of the individual. The\n         inviolable nature of the human personality is manifested in\n         the ability to make decisions on matters intimate to human\n         life. The autonomy of the individual is associated over\n         matters which can be kept private. These are concerns over\n         which there is a legitimate expectation of privacy. The body\n         and the mind are inseparable elements of the human\n         personality.

The crucial consideration is that a\n         woman&#x27;s right to privacy, dignity and bodily integrity\n         should be respected. This means that there should be no\n         restriction whatsoever on the exercise of reproductive\n         choices such as a woman&#x27;s right to refuse participation in\n         sexual activity or alternatively the insistence on use of\n         contraceptive methods. Furthermore, women are also free\n         to choose birth control methods such as undergoing\n         sterilisation procedures. Taken to their logical conclusion,\n         reproductive rights include a woman&#x27;s entitlement to carry\n         a pregnancy to its full term, to give birth and to\n         subsequently raise children. However, in the case of\n         pregnant women there is also a &quot;compelling State interest&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_96\">         in protecting the life of the prospective child. Therefore, the\n         termination of a pregnancy is only permitted when the\n         conditions specified in the applicable statute have been\n         fulfilled. Hence, the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_128\">MTP Act, 1971</a> can\n         also be viewed as reasonable restrictions that have been\n         placed on the exercise of reproductive choices.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_121\">         <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1500783\" id=\"span_157\">104. <a href=\"/doc/1500783/\" id=\"a_129\">Suchita Srivastava</a> (supra) rightly recognised that the\n         right of women to make reproductive choices is a dimension\n         of personal liberty under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_130\">Article 21.</a> It held that\n         reproductive rights include a woman&#x27;s entitlement to carry\n         the pregnancy to full term, give birth, and raise children.\n         More importantly, it also recognised that the right to\n         reproductive choice also includes the right not to procreate.</span>\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_158\">                                                                         52</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_122\">                            52 of 65\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_159\">          ::: Downloaded on - 13-03-2024 04:05:45 :::</span>\n                                                  Neutral Citation No:=2024:PHHC:033861\n\n\n\n\nCWP-4885-2024 (O&amp;M).                   -53-\n2024:PHHC:033861\n\n\n         In doing so, it situated the reproductive rights of women\n         within the core of constitutional rights.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_123\">         <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"91938676\" id=\"span_160\">105.

A woman&#x27;s decision to terminate a pregnancy is not a\n         frivolous one. Abortion is often the only way out of a very\n         difficult situation for a woman. An abortion is a carefully\n         considered decision taken by a woman who fears that the\n         welfare of the child she already has, and of other members\n         of the household that she is obliged to care for with limited\n         financial and other resources, may be compromised by the\n         birth of another child.

However, in case of an\n         unwanted or incidental pregnancy, the burden invariably\n         falls on the pregnant woman affecting her mental and\n         physical health. <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_135\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution recognizes\n         and protects the right of a woman to undergo termination of\n         pregnancy if her mental or physical health is at stake.\n         Importantly, it is the woman alone who has the right over\n         her body and is the ultimate decision-maker on the question\n         of whether she wants to undergo an abortion.\n\n\n         ii.

Privacy of the individual is an essential aspect of\n         dignity. Dignity has both an intrinsic and instrumental\n         value. As an intrinsic value, human dignity is an entitlement\n         or a constitutionally protected interest in itself. In its\n         instrumental facet, dignity and freedom are inseparably\n         intertwined, each being a facilitative tool to achieve the\n         other. The ability of the individual to protect a zone of\n         privacy enables the realisation of the full value of life and\n         liberty. Liberty has a broader meaning of which privacy is a\n         subset. All liberties may not be exercised in privacy. Yet\n         others can be fulfilled only within a private space. Privacy\n         enables the individual to retain the autonomy of the body\n         and mind. The autonomy of the individual is the ability to\n         make decisions on vital matters of concern to life. Privacy\n         has not been couched as an independent fundamental\n         right.... The intersection between one&#x27;s mental integrity and\n         privacy entitles the individual to freedom of thought, the\n         freedom to believe in what is right, and the freedom of self-\n         determination. When these guarantees intersect with\n         gender, they create a private space which protects all those\n         elements which are crucial to gender identity. The family,\n         marriage, procreation and sexual orientation are all\n         integral to the dignity of the individual. Above all, the\n         privacy of the individual recognises an inviolable right to\n         determine how freedom shall be exercised... Dignity cannot\n         exist without privacy.

The said\n\nprovisions are, however, not a means to dilute the provisions of Pre-\n\nConception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques Act, 1994.\n\n\n30           Hence, I am of the view that law needs no further\n\nelaboration. An unmarried girl/a single mother cannot be made to suffer\n\nsocial, physical, psychological and financial trauma merely for having\n\nexercised her rightful autonomy. Changed circumstances/material\n\nalterations as available to a married woman under Rule 3 B of the\n\nRules of 2003, as amended, would also subsist in favour of an unmarried\n\nconsenting adult and that when a consensual sexual relationship between\n\nadult parts away or is mutually closed, the same would have certain\n\ncallings equivalent to the scenario contemplated by the Legislature akin\n\nto divorce/widowhood for the purpose of seeking medical termination of\n\npregnancy. A changed scenario, in terms of requirement has to presume\n\na legal recognition of a relationship with her partner at par with a spousal\n\nrelationship stipulated under Rule 3 B of the Rules of 2003 and that on\n\nexistence of such circumstances which permit a married woman to seek\n\ntermination of pregnancy, the Court may exercise its power to grant\n\napproval to medical termination of pregnancy even in case of an\n\nunmarried girl.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_137\">\n31           Further, during the course of hearing, a question was also\n\nposed to the petitioner herein as to whether she would like to name or\n\ndisclose the identity of the person who is the father of the child,\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_178\">                                                                             59</span>\n                                59 of 65\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_179\">              ::: Downloaded on - 13-03-2024 04:05:45 :::</span>\n                                                      Neutral Citation No:=2024:PHHC:033861\n\n\n\n\nCWP-4885-2024 (O&amp;M).                        -60-\n2024:PHHC:033861\n\n\nhowever, she expressed her unwillingness to disclose the name. Her\n\nright of privacy and dignity empowers her to make a choice as to\n\nwhether she would like to disclose the name of the partner or not and\n\nthat the law cannot compel a woman to make public the name of the\n\nperson who is the father of the foetus and/or the child.\n\n\n32           Having recognized the right of the petitioner to seek\n\nmedical termination, this Court now proceeds on the factual aspects of\n\nthe case and to determine as to whether such permission needs to be\n\ngranted in the facts of the present case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_138\">\n33           I have gone through the judgments that have been cited by\n\nthe petitioner where pregnancy has been permitted to be terminated after\n\nexpiry of 24 weeks, however, in all the said judgments cited by the\n\nsenior counsel for the petitioner, the child/pregnancy posed grave risk to\n\nthe lives of mother as well as the child or the child suffered from serious\n\nphysical and mental abnormalities. While it is recognized that the foetus\n\nin the present case is an unwanted pregnancy and the possible social\n\nstigmatic fall out for the petitioner cannot be entirely ruled out, however,\n\nthe   legislature has prescribed the time frame within which such\n\ntermination may be permitted, after due consideration of the medical\n\ncondition and the status of the foetus. It is also seen that while the law\n\nmay confer a right to be exercised by the mother for seeking a\n\ntermination of pregnancy on occurrence of the circumstances stipulated\n\nthereunder, the above said right is recognised by law till such time that\n\nthe pregnancy completes 24 weeks. The mandate of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_147\">Article 21</a> of the\n\nConstitution of India guarantees life and personal liberty to an individual\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_180\">                                                                             60</span>\n                                 60 of 65\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_181\">              ::: Downloaded on - 13-03-2024 04:05:45 :::</span>\n                                                        Neutral Citation No:=2024:PHHC:033861\n\n\n\n\nCWP-4885-2024 (O&amp;M).                         -61-\n2024:PHHC:033861\n\n\nin accordance with the procedure established by law. Hence, when such\n\na right is subject to certain procedural restrictions and on occurrence of\n\nan event (i.e. the pregnancy beyond 24 weeks), an individual cannot\n\nclaim an unbridled right yet in her favour and to claim that\n\nnotwithstanding the mandate of the Act of 1971 and the Rules of 2003,\n\nyet, she is entitled to seek medical termination. The legislative wisdom\n\nof confining the time line is not a subject matter of challenge and is also\n\nnot confronted by any medical jurisprudence to the contrary. Invariably,\n\nin the process of carrying out a termination of the pregnancy, post expiry\n\nof 24 weeks, when a child is healthy and is grown, the implications and\n\nconsequences have been segregated and consciously confined by the\n\nLegislature. The law leaves it to the discretion of the constitutional\n\nCourts, to exercise on case to case basis, as to whether such\n\ncircumstances exist as would necessitate issuance of directions for\n\ntermination of pregnancy. Hence, the Court is required to take into\n\nconsideration the admissible evidence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_139\">\n34             Even though the Medical Board cannot substitute a decision\n\nof a person to exercise his right, however, once it is held that such right\n\nis circumscribed by the legal provisions, the opinion of the expert\n\nMedical Board of an Institution of Eminence, would not ordinarily be\n\ndisregarded.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_140\">\n35             It is also noticed herein that it is not a case where delay has\n\noccasioned on account of delay in adjudication, rather, the petitioner\n\nherself approached this Court after expiry of the statutory period.

Hence, she was\n\npregnant by 26 weeks when she approached the High Court. Further, the\n\nreport of the Medical Board of PGIMER, even though notices that the\n\npatient is medically and physically fit to undergo a procedure and\n\nexpressed a suicidal ideation of the petitioner and recommends\n\npsychological assessments and support, also states it to be a case of pre-\n\nterm delivery and not a medical termination as ordinarily understood.\n\nFor carrying out a termination in such circumstances, the doctors are\n\nrequired to carry out a feticide as per which the heartbeat of the child\n\nhave to be forcibly stopped, failing which the survival rates of the pre-\n\nmature delivered child would be more than 65%, having numerous\n\nneuro-developmental handicaps and increasing the morbidity of such\n\nchild. It seemingly is on account of the aforesaid circumstances and to\n\navoid committing of a feticide that the legislature decided a &#x27;cut off&#x27; for\n\npregnancy period before any such right/authority ought to be exercised.\n\n\n36           While pleading her circumstances, the petitioner is seeking\n\na direction from this Court to authorize the doctors to carry out a feticide\n\nfailing which it would be an instance of a pre-term delivery which is\n\nlikely to add to the hardships of the child himself. The Court cannot be\n\noblivious to the possibility of a pre-term delivery and the consequences\n\nwhich its order may have to a child or to assume a role where it takes\n\nupon itself to decide that the child ought not be allowed to be born alive.\n\nWhile ordinarily under general circumstances, this Court may have\n\napproved of the medical termination if the foetus or the mother would\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_184\">                                                                             62</span>\n                                62 of 65\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_185\">              ::: Downloaded on - 13-03-2024 04:05:45 :::</span>\n                                                        Neutral Citation No:=2024:PHHC:033861\n\n\n\n\nCWP-4885-2024 (O&amp;M).                          -63-\n2024:PHHC:033861\n\n\nhave suffered a grave physical or mental harm or the child was likely to\n\nbe born with serious physical, mental or psychological deformities,\n\nhowever, a mental shock or stigma as a result of a pregnancy not\n\napproved, but on account of a consensual relationship, cannot at this\n\njuncture be seen as an event which would have an irreversible mental\n\nhazard. Exercise of a right of sexual autonomy also at times comes along\n\nwith the responsibility to discharge duties that arise on exercise of such\n\nan option. A person may be called upon to live with the consequences of\n\nthe option exercised, when such consequences cannot be erased and are\n\nrequired to co-exist.
