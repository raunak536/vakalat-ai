With regards to the applicability of <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the RTI Act, 2005\nregarding non-disclosure of the &#x27;Income Tax Returns&amp; Form 26AS&#x27; of the third\nparty, this Commission refers to the judgment dated 03-10-2012 of the Hon&#x27;ble\nSupreme Court of India in SLP(C) No. 27734 of 2012 titled as\n<a href=\"/doc/192776100/\" id=\"a_7\">GirishRamchandra Deshpande v. Central Information Commission</a> &amp;ors.,\nwherein, it has been held as under:-</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">         &quot;12. The petitioner herein sought for copies of all memos, show\n         cause notices and censure/punishment awarded to the third\n         respondent from his employer and also details viz. movable and\n         immovable properties and also the details of his investments,\n         lending and borrowing from Banks and other financial institutions.\n         Further, he has also sought for the details of gifts stated to have\n         accepted by the third respondent, his family members and friends\n         and relatives at the marriage of his son. The information mostly\n         sought for finds a place in the income tax returns of the third\n         respondent. The question that has come up for consideration is\n         whether the abovementioned information sought for qualifies to be\n         &quot;personal information&quot; as defined in clause (j) of <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 8(1)</a> of\n         the RTI Act.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">         13. We are in agreement with the CIC and the courts below that\n         the details called for by the petitioner i.e. copies of all memos\n         issued to the third respondent, show cause notices and orders of\n         censure/punishment etc. are qualified to be personal information\n         as defined in clause (j) of <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 8(1)</a> of the RTI Act.

On the\n          other hand, the disclosure of which would cause unwarranted\n          invasion of privacy of that individual. Of course, in a given case, if\n          the Central Public Information Officer or the State Public\n          Information Officer of the Appellate Authority is satisfied that the\n          larger public interest justifies the disclosure of such information,\n          appropriate orders could be passed but the petitioner cannot claim\n          those details as a matter of right.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">          14. The details disclosed by a person in his income tax returns are\n          &quot;personal information&quot; which stand exempted from disclosure\n          under clause (j) of <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 8(1)</a> of the RTI Act, unless involves a\n          larger public interest and the Central Public Information Officer or\n          the State Public Information Officer or the Appellate Authority is\n          satisfied that the larger public interest justifies the disclosure of\n          such information.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_9\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"192776100\" id=\"span_4\">7.     The present matter wherein the appellant has sought the details of the\n&#x27;Income Tax Returns&amp; Form 26AS&#x27; ofhis estranged wife Ms. ShirinSumeet Kumar\ncan be distinguished from the decision dated 15-05-2018 of the Division Bench of\nthe Hon&#x27;ble High Court of Madhya Pradesh on the premise that in that matter\nthe information was sought regarding an employee&#x27;s salary from the employer\nbeing a government department i.e. the BSNL which otherwise was obliged to\ndisclose the remuneration of its employee in view of <a href=\"/doc/1493389/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 4(1)(b)(x)</a> of the RTI\nAct, 2005 and no direction was given by the Hon&#x27;ble High Court of Madhya\nPradesh to disclose the Income Tax Returns of the employee. Moreover, the\ndecision of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court of India in <a href=\"/doc/192776100/\" id=\"a_12\">GirishRamachandra\nDeshpande</a> (supra) was only distinguished with regard to the limited point that\nwife was entitled to know the remuneration details of her husband. No other\nopinion/decision was conveyed regarding other personal information. Therefore,\nthis Commission does not agree with the contentions put forth by the appellant for\ndisclosure of &#x27;Income Tax Returns&amp; Form 26AS&#x27; of his wife.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\">8.     Henceforth, the issue to be decided is whether the appellant claiming to be\nthe legally wedded husband of his estranged wife Ms. ShirinSumeet Kumar is\nentitled to seek details of her &#x27;Income Tax Returns&amp; Form 26AS&#x27;. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"45224879\" id=\"span_5\">In this regard, it\nis apt to mention the decision dated 01-07-2009 of the Hon&#x27;ble High Court of\nDelhi in W.P.(C) 803/2009 titled as <a href=\"/doc/45224879/\" id=\"a_13\">Vijay Prakash v.

In the matter at hand, the\nappellant has not succeeded in establishing that the information sought is for larger\npublic purpose.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"47087959\" id=\"span_7\">9.     Since &#x27;Income Tax Returns&amp; Form 26AS&#x27; of an individual is not a public\nactivity and rather it is in the nature of an obligation which a citizen owes to the\nState viz. to pay his taxes, this information cannot be disclosed to the appellant in\nthe absence of any larger public interest relying on the legal principle enunciated in\nthe judgment dated 11-06-2015 rendered by the Hon&#x27;ble Bombay High Court in\nWrit Petition No. 8753 of 2013 titled as <a href=\"/doc/47087959/\" id=\"a_15\">Shailesh Gandhi v.

I am afraid the said contention is thoroughly\n         misconceived as filing of Income Tax Returns can be no stretch of\n         imagination be said to be a public activity, but is an obligation\n         which a citizen owes to the State viz. to pay his taxes and since the\n         said information is held by the Income Tax Department in a\n         fiduciary capacity, the same cannot be directed to be revealed\n         unless the pre-requisites for the same are satisfied.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"69052901\" id=\"span_8\">10.

The act of filing returns with the\n     department cannot be construed as public activity. The expression\n     &quot;public activity&quot; would mean activities of a public nature and not\n     necessarily act done in compliance of a statute. The expression\n     &quot;public activity&quot; would denote activity done for the public and/or in\n     some manner available for participation by public or some section of\n     public. There is no public activity involved in filing a return or an\n     individual pursuing his assessment with the income tax authorities.\n     In this view, the information relating to individual assessee could not\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                                                            Page 4 of 7</span>\n      be disclosed.

From the words circumscribed u/<a href=\"/doc/436180/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 2(n)</a> of the RTI Act, 2005, it is\nvividly clear that any person other than the citizen making a request for\ninformation can be termed as &#x27;third party&#x27;.
