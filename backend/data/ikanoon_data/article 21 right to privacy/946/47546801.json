Further Fetal Cardiac examination\n\nwas conducted on 18/11/2019 and the existence of such\n\nserious multiple anomalies were confirmed. A specialist&#x27;s\n\nopinion was sought and it was observed by the specialist\n\nthat, there was a significant cardiomegaly with heart\n\noccupying more than 70% of thorasic cavity.

Learned counsel for the petitioner relied on a few\n\n Judgments passed by the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court, as well as,\n\n passed by different Division Benches of this Court dealing\n\n with the issue of granting permission for termination of\n\n pregnancy even after a statutory period of 20 weeks,\n\n provided under the <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_4\">MTP Act</a> was over.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_8\">  6.

The\n\n Division Bench considered various judgments passed by the\n\n Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court and discussed many issues.

In paragraph-116, the Division Bench has\n\nobserved that in such cases Writ Petition under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_15\">Article 226</a> of\n\nthe Constitution of India will have to be instituted in this\n\nCourt     if the       petitioner resides    within   the territorial\n\njurisdiction of this Court or if the cause of action arises within\n\nthe territorial jurisdiction of this Court to seek permission for\n\ntermination of her pregnancy if such termination is not\n\nimmediately necessary to save her life, but, where she alleges\n\nthat the circumstances set out in clauses (i) &amp; (ii) of <a href=\"/doc/312960/\" id=\"a_16\">Section\n\n3(2)(b)</a> of the MTP Act exist.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\">13.
