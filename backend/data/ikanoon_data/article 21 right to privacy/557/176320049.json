It is\n                       contended by him that Sub-section (4)(p) is subject to the provisions of Sub-\n                       section (4)(a) and in the case of a minor, it is only the guardian who can decide\n                       whether the pregnancy should be terminated or not. According to him, the\n                       application of Sub-section 4 (b) is excluded by its own language if the pregnant\n                       woman has not attained the age of eighteen. We are unable to accept this\n                       contention. The entire scheme of the Act shows that the provisions thereof can\n                       be invoked only by the pregnant woman. If she happens to be a minor, the\n                       registered medical practitioner, who is approached for terminating the\n                       pregnancy must take care to get the consent of the guardian of the minor in\n                       writing. Sub-section (4)(a) can never be understood as dispensing with the\n                       consent of the pregnant woman if she is below 18 years of age. The provision is\n                       only intended to help the registered medical practitioner to take into account\n                       all the relevant facts and circumstances as set out in Section 3 so as to decide\n                       whether the continuance of the pregnancy will involve any of the risks\n                       mentioned in the Section. For example, Sub-section (3) requires the medical\n                       practitioner to take into account the pregnant woman&#x27;s actual or reasonably\n                       foreseeable environment while determining the question whether the\n                       continuance of the pregnancy would involve such risk as is mentioned in Sub-\n                       section (2). In the case of a minor, it is, therefore, necessary for the medical\n                       practitioner in order to ascertain the relevant facts under Sub-section (3) to\n                       notify the guardian of the minor and get his written consent.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_115\">                                  44.....\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_116\">                                  45.....\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_117\">                                  46....\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_118\">                                  47....\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_119\">                                  48.

The Hindu law has always recognised the right of a son en ventre sa\n                       mere in the family property. In Mayne&#x27;s Hindu Law, 12th Edition, page 688\n                       (Para 443) it is said:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_128\">                                     &quot;A son who was in his mother&#x27;s womb at the time of partition\n                           but was born subsequent to it, is however entitled to reopen the\n                           partition and to receive a share equal to that of his brothers. For, a son\n                           in the womb is in point of law in existence. If the pregnancy is known at\n                           the time, the distribution should be deferred till its result is ascertained,\n                           or the distribution may take place, and a share equal to that of a son\n                           may be provisionally reserved so as to be allotted to the after-born son,\n                           if any. If the pregnancy is not known, and a son is afterwards born, a\n                           redistribution must take place of the estate as it then stands. However, if\n                           the son in the womb is not born alive he has no rights.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_57\">                                  54. <a href=\"/doc/895395/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 20</a> of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956, is in the following\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_60\">                  26/36</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_61\">\f                                                                                             H.C.P(MD)No.1240 of 2023</span>\n\n                       terms:-\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_58\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_129\">                                     &quot;A child who was in the womb at the time of the death of an\n                            intestate and who is subsequently born alive shall have the same right\n                            to inherit to the intestate as if he or she had been born before the death\n                            of the intestate, and the inheritance shall be deemed to vest in such a\n                            case with effect from the date of the death of the intestate.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_59\">                                                          CONCLUSION\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_60\">                                  55.
