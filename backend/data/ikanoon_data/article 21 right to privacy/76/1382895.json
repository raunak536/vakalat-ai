Though  the respondent\ncontested the petition contending that he had neither turned\nthe appellant  out from\t his house  nor withdrawn  from\t her\nsociety later  as he  made a statement in the Court that the\napplication under <a href=\"/doc/322349/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 9</a> be granted; a consent decree was\npassed by  the Sub-Judge  for the  restitution\tof  conjugal\nrights between the parties.\n     After a lapse of a year, the respondent-husband filed a\npetition under\t<a href=\"/doc/1284729/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 13</a>  of the Act against the appellant\nfor divorce  on the  ground that  though one year had lapsed\nfrom the  date of  passing the\tdecree\tfor  restitution  of\nconjugal rights\t no actual  co-habitation  had\ttaken  place\nbetween\t the   parties.\t The   appellant  filed\t  her  reply\ncontending that she was taken to the house of the husband by\nher parents  one month after the decree and that the husband\nkept her  in the  house for  two days and then she was again\nturned out. It was further alleged that an application under\n<a href=\"/doc/698708/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 28A</a> filed in the Subordinate Court was pending.\n304\n     The District  Judge after\tconsidering the\t evidence of\nthe civil  and\tcriminal  proceedings  pending\tbetween\t the\nparties, came  to the  conclusion that\tthere  had  been  no\nresumption of  cohabitation between  the parties and that in\nview of the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/542052/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 23</a> and in view of the fact\nthat the  previous decree  was a  consent decree and that at\nthe time  of the passing of the said decree, as there was no\nprovision like\t<a href=\"/doc/439618/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 13B</a> i.e. divorce by mutual consent&#x27;;\nheld that  as the  decree for restitution of conjugal rights\nwas passed  by the  consent of\tthe parties, the husband was\nnot entitled to a decree for divorce.\n     The respondent  filed an  appeal. A Single Judge of the\nHigh  Court   following\t the   decision\t of  this  Court  in\nDharmendra Kumar  v. Usha Kumari [1978] 1 SCR 315, held that\nit could  not be  said that the husband was taking advantage\nof his\t&#x27;wrongs&#x27;, but  however expressed  the view  that the\ndecree for  restitution of  conjugal  rights  could  not  be\npassed with  the consent of the parties, and therefore being\na collusive  one disentitled  the husband  to a\t decree\t for\ndivorce, and  referred the  matter to  the Chief Justice for\nconstitution of\t a Division  Bench for\tconsideration of the\nquestion.\n     The Division  Bench held  following Joginder  Singh  v.\nSmt. Pushpa,  AIR 1969\tPunjab and  Haryana page  397 that a\nconsent decree could not be termed to be a collusive, decree\nso  as\t to  disentitle\t the  petitioner  to  a\t decree\t for\nrestitution of\tconjugal rights,  and that  in view  of\t the\nlanguage of  <a href=\"/doc/542052/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 23</a>\t if the\t Court\thad  tried  to\tmake\nconciliation between  the parties  and conciliation had been\nordered, the  husband was  not disentitled  to get a decree.\nThe appeal  was allowed, and the husband granted a decree of\ndivorce.\n     In the  appeal to this Court it was contended on behalf\nof the\twife appellant\tthat : (a) in view of the expression\n&#x27;wrong&#x27; in  <a href=\"/doc/1070636/\" id=\"a_15\">section 23(1)  (a)</a> of  the Act,  the husband was\ndisentitled to\tget a  decree for divorce, and (b) <a href=\"/doc/322349/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 9</a>\nof the Act was arbitrary and void as offending <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_17\">Article 14</a> of\nthe Constitution.\n     Dismissing the Appeal,\n^\n     HELD: (1)\tIn India  conjugal rights  i.e. right of the\nhusband or  the wife  to the  society of the other spouse is\nnot merely creature of the statute. Such a right is inherent\nin the\tvery  institution  of  marriage\t itself.  There\t are\nsufficient safeguards in <a href=\"/doc/322349/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 9</a> of the Hindu Marriage Act\nto prevent it from being a tyranny. [314 D-E]\n305\n     2. <a href=\"/doc/322349/\" id=\"a_19\">Section\t 9</a> is  only a  codification of\tpre-existing\nlaw.

[314 H]\n     3. <a href=\"/doc/322349/\" id=\"a_21\">Section\t 9</a> of the Act is not violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_22\">Article 14</a>\nor <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_23\">Article  21</a> of  the Constitution  if the  purpose of\t the\ndecree for restitution of conjugal rights in the said Act is\nunderstood in  its proper  perspective and  if the method of\nexecution in cases of disobedience is kept in view. [315 G]\n     T. Sareetha  v. Venkata  Subbaiah, A.I.R.\t1983  Andhra\nPradesh page 356, over-ruled.\n     Smt. Harvinder kaur v. Harmander Singh Choudhry, A.I.R.\n1984 Delhi, page 66, approved.\n     4. It  is significant  that unlike a decree of specific\nperformance  of\t  contract;  a\tdecree\tfor  restitution  of\nconjugal rights,  where the disobedience to such a decree is\nwillful i.e.  is deliberate, might be enforced by attachment\nof property. Where the disobedience follows as a result of a\nwillful conduct\t i.e. where  conditions are there for a wife\nor a  husband to obey the decree for restitution of conjugal\nrights but  disobeys the  same in  spite of such conditions,\nthen only  the properties  have to  be attached, is provided\nfor. This  is so  to enable  the Court\tin appropriate cases\nwhen the  Court has  decreed restitution for conjugal rights\nto offer inducement for the husband or wife to live together\nand to\tsettle up  the matter  amicably. It  serves a social\npurpose,  as  an  aid  to  the\tprevention  of\tbreak-up  of\nmarriage.[315 C-F]\n     5. (i)  Even after\t the final  decree  of\tdivorce\t the\nhusband would  continue to pay maintenance to the wife until\nshe remarries  and would maintain the one living daughter of\nthe marriage.  Separate maintenance  should be\tpaid for the\nwife and the living daughter. Wife would be entitled to such\nmaintenance only until she remarries and the daughter to her\nmaintenance until she is married. [316 C; E]\n     (ii) Until\t altered by appropriate order on application\nor proper materials,  such maintenance should be Rs. 200 per\nmonth for  the wife, and Rs. 300 per month for the daughter.\n[316 D]\n\n\n\nJUDGMENT:</pre>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_1\">     CIVIL APPELLATE  JURISDICTION: Civil  Appeal No. 187 of\n1983.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_2\">     From the Judgment and Order dated the 17th August, 1982\nof the\tPunjab and  Haryana High  Court in First Appeal From\nOrder No. 199-M of 1979.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">306</span>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_3\">     R.

The parties herein were married\nat Jullundur City according to Hindu Vedic rites on or about\n24th January, 1975. The first daughter of the marriage Menka\nwas born on 4th January, 1976. On 28th February, 1977 second\ndaughter Guddi\twas born.  It is alleged that 16th May, 1977\nwas the\t last day  of cohabitation  by the  parties.  It  is\nfurther alleged\t that on  16th May,  1977,  the\t respondent-\nhusband turned\tthe appellant  out of his house and withdrew\nhimself from  her society. The second daughter unfortunately\nexpired in the house of the respondent/father on 6th August,\n1977. On 17th October, 1977, the wife-appellant filed a suit\nagainst the husband/respondent herein under <a href=\"/doc/322349/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 9</a> of the\nHindu Marriage Act, 1955 hereinafter referred to as the said\nAct for restitution of conjugal rights.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">     In view  of the  argument now sought to be advanced, it\nis necessary  to refer\tto the\tsaid petition.\tIn the\tsaid\npetition, the  wife had\t set out the history of the marriage\nas  hereinbefore   briefly  mentioned  and  alleged  several\nmaltreatments both  by the husband as well as by her in-laws\nand thereafter\tclaimed decree\tfor restitution\t of conjugal\nrights. On 21st March, 1978, the learned Sub-Judge Ist Class\npassed an  order granting  Rs. 185  per month as maintenance\npendente lite  and Rs.\t300 as\tthe litigation\texpenses. On\n28th March, 1978, a consent decree was passed by the learned\nSub-Judge Ist  Class for  restitution of conjugal rights. It\nmay be\tmentioned that\ton the\tpetition  of  the  wife\t for\nrestitution  of\t  conjugal  rights,  the  husband-respondent\nappeared and  filed his\t written statement admitting therein\nthe factum  of marriage\t between the  parties but denied the\nfact that  the respondent  had ever made any demand from the\npetitioner as  alleged or  had\tever  disliked\ther  or\t had\nwithdrawn from\ther society or turned her out from his house\nas alleged  by the  wife  petitioner  in  her  petition\t for\nrestitution of\tconjugal rights.  The respondent  thereafter\nmade a\tstatement in  the court\t that the application of the\npetitioner under  <a href=\"/doc/322349/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 9</a>  of the  said Act be granted and\ndecree thereof\tbe passed. Accordingly the learned Sub-Judge\nIst Class  on 28th  March 1978\tpassed the  decree  for\t the\nrestitution\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">307</span>\nof conjugal  rights between  the parties.  It was alleged by\nthe petitioner-wife that the appellant had gone to the house\nof the respondent and lived with him for two days as husband\nand wife.  This fact has been disbelieved by all the courts.\nThe courts  have come  to the conclusion and that conclusion\nis  not\t  challenged  before  us  that\tthere  has  been  no\ncohabitation after the passing of the decree for restitution\nof conjugal rights.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">     On 19th  April, 1979,  the respondent/husband  filed  a\npetition under\t<a href=\"/doc/1284729/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 13</a>  of\tthe  said  Act\tagainst\t the\nappellant for divorce on the ground that one year had passed\nfrom the  date of  the decree  for restitution\tof  confugal\nrights, but  no actual\tcohabitation had taken place between\nthe parties.  The appellant  filed her\treply  to  the\tsaid\npetition. The categorical case in reply of the appellant was\nthat it\t was incorrect\tthat after  passing of\tthe  decree,\nthere had been no restitution of conjugal rights between the\nparties, positive  case of  the\t appellant  was\t that  after\npassing of  the decree,\t the wife  was taken to the house of\nthe husband  by the  parents of\t the wife after one month of\nthe decree  and that  the husband kept the wife in his house\nfor two\t days and  she was  again turned out. It was further\nalleged that the wife had filed an application under <a href=\"/doc/698708/\" id=\"a_27\">Section\n28A</a> of\tthe said  Act in  the court of Sub-Judge, 1st Class,\nJullundur on  22nd January,  1979 with\tthe request that the\nhusband should\tbe directed to comply with the decree passed\nagainst him  under  <a href=\"/doc/322349/\" id=\"a_28\">Section  9</a>\tof  the\t said  Act  and\t the\napplication was pending at the time when the reply was filed\nby the wife to the petition for divorce.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">     The  learned  District  Judge  on\t15th  October,\t1979\ndismissed the  petition of  the\t husband  for  divorce.\t The\nlearned Judge  framed two  issues, one was whether there has\nbeen no\t restitution of conjugal rights after the passing of\nthe decree  for the  restitution  of  conjugal\trights,\t and\nsecondly to  what relief was the husband entitled to ? After\nconsidering the\t evidence of  civil and criminal proceedings\npending between\t the parties,  the learned Judge came to the\nconclusion that there has been no resumption of cohabitation\nbetween the  parties after  28th March, 1978 and decided the\nissue in favour of the husband but on the question of relief\nthe learned  Judge was\tof the\tview that  in  view  of\t the\nprovisions of  <a href=\"/doc/542052/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 23</a> of the said Act and in view of the\nfact that  the previous\t decree was  a consent decree and at\nthat time  there was  no provision like provision of <a href=\"/doc/439618/\" id=\"a_30\">Section\n13B</a> of\tthe said  Act i.e.  &#x27;divorce by mutual consent&#x27;, the\nlearned Judge  was of  the  view  that\tas  the\t decree\t for\nrestitution\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">308</span>\nof conjugal rights was passed by the consent of the parties,\nthe husband was not entitled to a decree for divorce.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_9\">     Being aggrieved  by the  said decision,  there  was  an\nappeal before  the High\t Court of Punjab and Haryana. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1248559\" id=\"span_4\">So far\nas last\t mentioned ground was concerned, the High Court held\nthat in\t view of  the decision\tof this Court in the case of\n<a href=\"/doc/1248559/\" id=\"a_31\">Dharmendra Kumar  v. Usha  Kumari</a>, this\t contention was\t not\nopen to\t the wife. The court was of the opinion that in view\nof <a href=\"/doc/1248559/\" id=\"a_32\">the\tsaid decision</a>  of this\tCourt, it  could not be said\nthat the  husband was  taking advantage\t of his &#x27;wrongs&#x27;. In\n<a href=\"/doc/1248559/\" id=\"a_33\">the said  decision</a> this\t Court noted  that it  would not  be\nreasonable to  hold that  the relief  which was available to\nthe spouse against whom a decree for restitution of conjugal\nrights had  been passed should be denied to the one who does\nnot comply  with the  decree passed  against him or her. The\nexpression &quot;in\torder to  be a &#x27;wrong&#x27; within the meaning of\n<a href=\"/doc/1070636/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 23  (1) (a)</a>  the conduct alleged has to be something\nmore than  mere disinclination\tto  agree  to  an  offer  of\nreunion, it  must be  misconduct serious  enough to  justify\ndenial of  the relief  to which\t the husband  or the wife is\notherwise entitled  to. So,  therefore, <a href=\"/doc/1070636/\" id=\"a_35\">Section\t 23 (1)\t (a)</a>\nprovides as follows:-</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">\t  &quot;23. (1) In any proceeding under this Act, whether\n     defended or not, if the Court is satisfied that-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">\t  (a) any  of the grounds for granting relief exists\n     and the  petitioner except in cases where the relief is\n     sought by\thim on\tthe ground  specified in  sub-clause\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">     (a), sub-clause (b) or sub-clause (c) of clause (ii) of\n     <a href=\"/doc/635068/\" id=\"a_36\">section 5</a>\tis not in any way taking advantage of his or\n     her own  wrong or\tdisability for\tthe purpose  of such\n     relief and&quot;).\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_10\">     In that view of the matter, the High Court rejected the\ncontention. So\tfar as\tthe other  aspect was concerned, the\nlearned\t Judge\texpressed  the\tview  that  the\t decree\t for\nrestitution of\tconjugal rights could not be passed with the\nconsent of  the parties\t and therefore being a collusive one\ndisentitled the\t husband to  a decree for divorce. This view\nwas taken  by the  learned trial judge relying on a previous\ndecision of  the High  Court. Mr.  Justice Goyal of the High\nCourt felt  that this  view required  reconsideration and he\ntherefore referred  the matter\tto  the\t Chief\tJustice\t for\nconstitution of\t a Division  Bench of the High Court for the\nconsideration of this question.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">309</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\">     The matter\t thereafter came  up before a Division Bench\nof  Punjab   and  Haryana   High  Court\t and  Chief  Justice\nSandhawalia for the said court on consideration of different\nauthorities came  to the  conclusion that  a consent  decree\ncould not  be termed  to be  a collusive  decree  so  as  to\ndisentitle the\tpetitioner  to\tdecree\tfor  restitution  of\nconjugal  rights.  It  may  be\tmentioned  that\t before\t the\nDivision Bench\tof behalf of the appellant-wife, counsel did\nnot assail the factual finding of the Trial Court that there\nwas no\tco-habitation after  the decree\t for restitution  of\nconjugal rights nor did he press the first ground of defence\nnamely that  the appellant  could not  take advantage of his\n&#x27;wrong&#x27; because\t of having refused cohabitation in execution\nof the\tdecree. However,  the ground  that  the\t decree\t for\nrestitution of\tconjugal rights\t was in\t a  sense  collusive\ndecree was pressed before the Division Bench. In view of the\nFull Bench  decision of the Punjab and Haryana High Court in\nthe case  of Joginder  Singh  v.  Smt.\tPushpa\twherein\t the\nmajority of the Judges of the Full Bench held that a consent\ndecree in  all cases  could not\t be said  to be\t a collusive\ndecree and  where the  parties had  agreed to  passing of  a\ndecree after attempts had been made to settle the matter, in\nview of the language of <a href=\"/doc/542052/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 23</a> of the court had tried to\nmake conciliation  between the\tparties and conciliation had\nbeen ordered,  the husband  was not  disentitled  to  get  a\ndecree.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_12\">     <a href=\"/doc/542052/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 23</a> sub-section (2) provides as follows:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">\t  &quot;(2)-Before proceeding  to grant  any relief under\n     this Act,\tit shall  be the  duty of  the court  in the\n     first instance,  in every\tcase where it is possible so\n     to do consistently with the nature and circumstances of\n     the case,\tto make\t every endeavor\t to  bring  about  a\n     reconciliation between the parties:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">\t  Provided  that  nothing  contained  in  this\tsub-\n     section shall apply to any proceeding wherein relief is\n     sought on\tany of the grounds specified in clause (ii),\n     clause (iii),  clause (iv),  clause (v), clause (vi) or\n     clause (vii) of sub-section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/1284729/\" id=\"a_39\">section 13</a>.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">     In this  case from\t the facts on record it appears that\nthere  was  no\tcollusion  between  the\t parties.  The\twife\npetitioned against  the husband\t on certain allegations, the\nhusband denied\tthese allegations.  He stated  that  he\t was\nwilling to  take the  wife back.  A decree on that basis was\npassed. It is difficult to find any collusion as such in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">310</span>\nthe instant  case. Apart  from that we are in agreement with\nthe majority  of the learned judges of the Division Bench of\nPunjab and  Haryana High Court in the case of Joginder Singh\nv. Smt.\t Pushpa (supra)\t that all  cases of  consent decrees\ncannot be  said to  be collusive.  Consent decrees per se in\nmatrimonial matters  are not  collusive. As would be evident\nfrom legislative  intent of  <a href=\"/doc/439618/\" id=\"a_40\">Section  13B</a>  that\t divorce  by\nmutual consent is no longer foreign to Indian law of divorce\nbut of\tcourse this  is a  subsequent amendment\t and was not\napplicable at  the time\t when the  decree  in  question\t was\npassed. In  the premises  we accept the majority view of the\nDivision Bench\tof Punjab  and Haryana\tHigh Court  on\tthis\npoint.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_14\">     In this  appeal before this Court, counsel for the wife\ndid not challenge the finding of the Division Bench that the\nconsent decree\tas such\t was not  bad or  collusive. What he\ntried to  urge before  us was that in view of the expression\n&#x27;wrong&#x27; in  <a href=\"/doc/1070636/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 23(1)  (a)</a> of  the Act,  the husband was\ndisentitled in this case to get a decree for divorce. It was\nsought to  be urged that from the very beginning the husband\nwanted\tthat   decree  for  divorce  should  be\t passed.  He\ntherefore  did\t not  deliberately  oppose  the\t decree\t for\nrestitution of\tconjugal rights.  It was  submitted  on\t the\nother  hand   that  the\t  respondent/husband  had  with\t the\nintention of  ultimately having\t divorce allowed  the wife a\ndecree for  the restitution of conjugal rights knowing fully\nwell that  this decree\the would  not honour  and thereby he\nmisled the  wife and  the Court\t and thereafter\t refused  to\ncohabitate with\t the wife  and now, it was submitted, cannot\nbe allowed  to take  advantage of  his\t&#x27;wrong&#x27;.  There\t is,\nhowever, no whisper of these allegations in the pleading. As\nusual, on this being pointed out, the counsel prayed that he\nshould be  given an  opportunity of  amending his  pleadings\nand, the parties, with usual plea, should not suffer for the\nmistake of  the lawyers.  In this  case, however,  there are\ninsurmountable difficulties.  Firstly there was no pleading,\nsecondly this  ground was not urged before any of the courts\nbelow which is a question of fact, thirdly the facts pleaded\nand the\t allegations made by the wife in the trial court and\nbefore the  Division Bench  were contrary  to the  facts now\nsought to  be urged  in support\t to her appeal. The definite\ncase of\t the wife  was that after the decree for restitution\nof conjugal rights, the husband and wife cohabitated for two\ndays. The  ground now sought to be urged is that the husband\nwanted the  wife to have a decree for judicial separation by\nsome kind  of a trap and then not to cohabitate with her and\nthereafter obtain  this decree\tfor divorce.  This would  be\nopposed to  the facts  alleged in  the defence\tby the wife.\nTherefore\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">311</span>\nquite apart  from the  fact that there was no pleading which\nis a  serious and fatal mistake, there is no scope of giving\nany opportunity\t of amending  the pleadings  at\t this  stage\npermitting the\twife to\t make an  inconsistent case. Counsel\nfor the appellant sought to urge that the expression &#x27;taking\nadvantage of  his or  her own  wrongs&#x27; in clause (a) of sub-\n<a href=\"/doc/542052/\" id=\"a_42\">section 23</a>  must be  construed in such a manner as would not\nmake the  Indian wives\tsuffer at  the hands  of cunning and\ndishonest husbands.  Firstly even  if there is any scope for\naccepting this broad argument, it has no factual application\nto this\t case and  secondly if that is so then it requires a\nlegislation to\tthat effect.  We  are  therefore  unable  to\naccept the  contention of counsel for the appellant that the\nconduct of  the husband sought to be urged against him could\npossibly come  within the  expression &#x27;his  own\t wrongs&#x27;  in\n<a href=\"/doc/1070636/\" id=\"a_43\">section 23(1)  (a)</a> of  the Act\tso as to disentitle him to a\ndecree for  divorce to\twhich he is otherwise entitled to as\nheld by\t the  courts  below.  Further  more  we\t reach\tthis\nconclusion without  any mental\tcompunction  because  it  is\nevident that  for whatever  be the reasons this marriage has\nbroken down  and the  parties can no longer live together as\nhusband and  wife, if  such is the situation it is better to\nclose the chapter.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1987982\" id=\"span_8\">Our attention,  however, was  drawn to  a decision of a\nlearned single judge of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in the\ncase of\t <a href=\"/doc/1987982/\" id=\"a_44\">T.  Sareetha  v.  Venkata  Subbaiah</a>.  In  <a href=\"/doc/1987982/\" id=\"a_45\">the\tsaid\ndecision</a> the  learned judge  had observed that the remedy of\nrestitution of\tconjugal rights provided for by <a href=\"/doc/322349/\" id=\"a_46\">Section 9</a> of\nthe said Act was a savage and barbarous remedy violating the\nright to  privacy and human dignity guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_47\">Article 21</a>\nof the\tConstitution. Hence, according to the learned judge,\n<a href=\"/doc/322349/\" id=\"a_48\">Section 9</a> was constitutionally void. Any statutory provision\nthat abridged  the rights  guaranteed by  Part\tIII  of\t the\nConstitution would  have to  be declared  void in  terms  of\n<a href=\"/doc/134715/\" id=\"a_49\">Article 13</a>  of\tthe  Constitution.  According  to  the\tsaid\nlearned judge,\t<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_50\">Article 21</a>  guaranteed\tright  to  life\t and\npersonal liberty  against the  State action.  Formulated  in\nsimple negative\t terms, its  range of  operation  positively\nforbidding the\tState from  depriving any person of his life\nor  personal  liberty  except  according  to  the  procedure\nestablished by\tlaw was\t of far-reaching  dimensions and  of\noverwhelming  constitutional   significance.  Learned  judge\nobserved that  a decree\t for restitution  of conjugal rights\nconstituted the grossest form of violation of any individual\nright to  privacy. According to the learned judge, it denied\nthe woman her free choice whether, when and how her body was\nto\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">312</span>\nbecome the  vehicle for\t the procreation  of  another  human\nbeing. A decree for restitution of conjugal rights deprived,\naccording to  the learned judge, a woman of control over her\nchoice as and when and by whom the various parts of her body\nshould be  allowed to be sensed. The woman loses her control\nover  her   most  intimate   decisions.\t The  learned  judge\ntherefore  was\tof  the\t view  that  the  right\t to  privacy\nguaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_51\">Article 21</a> was flagrantly violated by a decree\nfor restitution of conjugal rights. The learned judge was of\nthe view  that a  wife who was keeping away from her husband\nbecause of  permanent or  even temporary estrangement cannot\nbe forced,  without violating her right to privacy to bear a\nchild by  her husband.\tDuring a  time when she was probably\ncontemplating an action for divorce, the use and enforcement\nof <a href=\"/doc/322349/\" id=\"a_52\">Section  9</a> of  the said  Act against\t the estranged\twife\ncould irretrievably  alter her\tposition by  bringing  about\nforcible conception  permanently ruining  her mind, body and\nlife and everything connected with it. The learned judge was\ntherefore clearly of the view that <a href=\"/doc/322349/\" id=\"a_53\">Section 9</a> of the said Act\nviolated <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_54\">Article  21</a> of the Constitution. He referred to the\nScarman Commission&#x27;s  report  in  England  recommending\t its\nabolition. The\tlearned judge  was also\t of  the  view\tthat\n<a href=\"/doc/322349/\" id=\"a_55\">Section 9</a>  of the  said Act,  promoted no  legitimate public\npurpose based  on any conception of the general good. It did\nnot therefore  subserve any  social good.  <a href=\"/doc/322349/\" id=\"a_56\">Section 9</a>  of the\nsaid Act  was, therefore,  held to  be arbitrary and void as\noffending <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_57\">Article  14</a> of  the  Constitution.  Learned  judge\nfurther observed  that though  <a href=\"/doc/322349/\" id=\"a_58\">Section 9</a> of the said Act did\nnot in\tform offend  the classification test, inasmuch as it\nmade no\t discrimination between\t a husband  and wife, on the\nother hand,  by making the remedy of restitution of conjugal\nrights equally\tavailable  both\t to  wife  and\thusband,  it\napparently satisfied the equality test. But bare equality of\ntreatment regardless  of the  inequality  of  realities\t was\nneither justice nor homage to the constitutional principles.\nHe relied  on the  decision of\tthis Court  in the  case  of\nMurthy Match  Works, Etc. Etc. v. The Assistant Collector of\nCentral Excise\tEtc. The  learned judge, however, was of the\nopinion based  on how  this remedy  was\t found\tused  almost\nexclusively by the husband and was rarely resorted to by the\nwife.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_16\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"191703\" id=\"span_10\">The  learned   judge  noticed   and  that\t is  a\tvery\nsignificant point  that decree\tfor restitution\t of conjugal\nrights can  only be  enforced under <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_59\">Order 21 Rule 32 of Code\nof Civil Procedure</a>. He also referred to certain trend in the\nAmerican law and came to the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">313</span>\nconclusion that <a href=\"/doc/322349/\" id=\"a_60\">Section 9</a> of the said Act was null and void.\nThe above view of the learned single judge of Andhra Pradesh\nwas dissented from in a decision of the learned single judge\nof the\tDelhi High  Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/191703/\" id=\"a_61\">Smt. Harvinder Kaur\nv. Harmander  Singh Choudhry</a>.  In  <a href=\"/doc/191703/\" id=\"a_62\">the\tsaid  decision</a>,\t the\nlearned judge  of the  Delhi High  Court expressed  the view\nthat <a href=\"/doc/322349/\" id=\"a_63\">Section 9</a> of the said Act was not violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_64\">Articles\n14</a> and\t<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_65\">21</a> of the Constitution. The learned judge noted that\nthe  object   of  restitution  decree  was  to\tbring  about\ncohabitation between  the estranged  parties  so  that\tthey\ncould live  together in\t the matrimonial  home in amity. The\nleading idea of <a href=\"/doc/322349/\" id=\"a_66\">Section 9</a> was to preserve the marriage. From\nthe definition\tof cohabitation\t and consortium, it appeared\nto the\tlearned judge that sexual intercourse was one of the\nelements that went to make up the marriage, but that was not\nthe summum  bonum. The\tcourts do  not and  can not  enforce\nsexual\tintercourse.   Sexual\trelations   constituted\t  an\nimportant element  in the conception of marriage, but it was\nalso true  that these  did not\tconstitute its whole content\nnor could the remaining aspects of matrimonial consortium be\nsaid to be wholly unsubstantial or of trivial character. The\nremedy of  restitution aimed  at cohabitation and consortium\nand not\t merely at  sexual intercourse.\t The  learned  judge\nexpressed the  view that  the  restitution  decree  did\t not\nenforce sexual\tintercourse. It\t was a\tfallacy to hold that\nthe restitution of conjugal rights constituted &quot;the starkest\nform of governmental invasion&quot; of &quot;marital privacy&quot;.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_17\">     This point namely validity of <a href=\"/doc/322349/\" id=\"a_67\">Section 9</a> of the said Act\nwas not\t canvassed in  the instant  case in the courts below\ncounsel for  the appellant,  however, sought  to  urge\tthis\npoint before  us as a legal proposition. We have allowed him\nto do so.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_18\">     Having considered the views of the learned single judge\nof the\tAndhra Pradesh High Court and that of learned single\njudge of  Delhi High  Court, we\t prefer to  accept  on\tthis\naspect namely  on the  validity of <a href=\"/doc/322349/\" id=\"a_68\">Section 9</a> of the said Act\nthe views  of the  learned single  judge of  the Delhi\tHigh\nCourt. It  may be  mentioned that  conjugal  rights  may  be\nviewed in  its proper  perspective by  keeping in  mind\t the\ndictionary meaning  of the  expression\t&quot;Conjugal&quot;.  Shorter\nOxford English\tDictionary, 3rd\t Edn. Vol.  I page 371 notes\nthe meaning  of &#x27;conjugal&#x27;  as &quot;of or pertaining to marriage\nor to husband and wife in their relations to each other&quot;. In\nthe Dictionary\tof English  Law, 1959 Edn. at page 453, Earl\nJowitt defines &#x27;conjugal rights&#x27; thus:\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">314</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">\t  &quot;The right  which husband  and wife  have to\teach\n     other&#x27;s society  and marital  intercourse. The suit for\n     restitution of  conjugal rights  is a matrimonial suit,\n     cognizable in  the\t Divorce  Court,  which\t is  brought\n     whenever either  the husband or the wife lives separate\n     from the  other without any sufficient reason, in which\n     case the  court will  decree  restitution\tof  conjugal\n     rights (Matrimonial  Causes Act, 1950, s. 15), but will\n     not enforce  it by attachment, substituting however for\n     attachment, if the wife be the petitioner, an order for\n     periodical payments by the husband to the wife (s.22).\n\t  Conjugal rights  cannot be  enforced by the act of\n     either party, and a husband cannot seize and detain his\n     wife by force (R.V. Jackson [1891] 1 Q.B. 671)&quot;.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_19\">     In India  it may  be borne in mind that conjugal rights\ni.e. right  of the husband or the wife to the society of the\nother spouse  is not  merely creature of the statute. Such a\nright is  inherent  in\tthe  very  institution\tof  marriage\nitself. See  in this  connection Mulla&#x27;s Hindu Law-15th Edn.\np. 567-Para  443. There are sufficient safeguards in <a href=\"/doc/322349/\" id=\"a_69\">Section\n9</a> to  prevent it from being a tyranny. The importance of the\nconcept of conjugal rights can be viewed in the light of Law\nCommission-71st Report\ton the\tHindu  Marriage\t Act,  1955-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">&quot;Irretrievable Breakdown of Marriage as a Ground of Divorce,\nPara 6.5 where it is stated thus:-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">\t  &quot;Moreover, the essence of marriage is a sharing of\n     common life,  a sharing  of all the happiness that life\n     has to offer and all the misery that has to be faced in\n     life,  an\t experience  of\t the  joy  that\t comes\tfrom\n     enjoying, in  common, things  of the  matter and of the\n     spirit and\t from showering\t love and affection on one&#x27;s\n     offspring. Living\ttogether is a symbol of such sharing\n     in all its aspects. Living apart is a symbol indicating\n     the negation  of such  sharing. It\t is indicative\tof a\n     disruption of  the essence\t of marriage-&quot;breakdown&quot; and\n     if it  continues for  a fairly  long period,  it  would\n     indicate  destruction   of\t the  essence  of  marriage-\n     &quot;irretrievable breakdown&quot;.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_20\">     <a href=\"/doc/322349/\" id=\"a_70\">Section 9</a>\tonly is\t a codification of pre-existing law.\nRule 32\t of <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_71\">Order  21 of  the Code  of Civil Procedure</a> deals\nwith decree  for specific  performance\tfor  restitution  of\nconjugal rights or for an\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">315</span>\ninjuction. Sub-rule (1) of Rule 32 is in these terms:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">\t  &quot;Where the  party against  whom a  decree for\t the\n     specific performance  of a contract, or for restitution\n     of conjugal  rights or  for  an  injunction,  has\tbeen\n     passed, has  had an  opportunity of  obeying the decree\n     and has  willfully failed to obey it, the decree may be\n     enforced in  the case  of a  decree for  restitution of\n     conjugal rights  by the  attachment of his property or,\n     in the case of a decree for the specific performance of\n     a contract, or for an injuction by his detention in the\n     civil prison,  or by the attachment of his property, or\n     by both.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_21\">     It is  significant to  note that  unlike  a  decree  of\nspecific  performance\tof  contract,\tfor  restitution  of\nconjugal rights\t the sanction is provided by court where the\ndisobedience to such a decree is willful i.e. is deliberate,\nin spite  of  the  opportunities  and  there  are  no  other\nimpediments, might be enforced by attachment of property. So\nthe only  sanction is  by  attachment  of  property  against\ndisobedience of\t a decree for restitution of conjugal rights\nwhere the  disobedience follows\t as a  result of  a  willful\nconduct i.e.  where conditions\tare there  for a  wife or  a\nhusband to  obey the  decree  for  restitution\tof  conjugal\nrights but  disobeys the  same in  spite of such conditions,\nthen  only  financial  sanction,  provided  he\tor  she\t has\nproperties to be attached, is provided for. This is so as an\ninducement by  the court  in appropriate case when the court\nhas decreed  restitution for  conjugal rights  and that\t the\ncourt can  only decree\tif there  is no\t just reason for not\npassing decree\tfor restitution\t of conjugal rights to offer\ninducement for the husband or wife to live together in order\nto  give  them\tan  opportunity\t to  settle  up\t the  matter\namicably.
