It is stated that the inmates of the hostel\n\nwere not allowed to use their mobile phone from 10 p.m to 6 a.m within the hostel\n\nand that undergraduate students were not allowed to use laptop also in the hostel.\n\nWhile so from 24.06.2019 onwards the duration of the restriction in using the\n\nmobile phones was changed as 6 p.m to 10 p.m. The petitioner claims that though\n\nshe, along with other inmates of the hostel, met the Deputy Warden - the 5 th\n\nrespondent, requested to convene a meeting of the inmates, explaining the\n\ninconveniences caused to them on account of the restrictions, the Deputy Warden\n\nor the matron did not respond.         It is also stated that though a meeting was\n\nconvened within a week thereafter, no discussion was made regarding the\n\nrestriction of the electronic devices. It is stated that the 5 th respondent sent a\n\nWhatsApp message informing that those who do not abide by the rules would have\n\nto vacate the hostel. The petitioner claims that she thereupon approached the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\"> W.P(C).No.19716/2019-L                     4</span>\n\nPrincipal on 03.07.2019 and submitted Ext.P2 letter requesting to relax the\n\nrestrictions. Thereupon, Ext.P3 letter was obtained from her in writing to the\n\neffect that she was not willing to abide by the new rule restricting usage of phone\n\nbetween 6 p.m to 10 p.m. Thereupon her parents were asked to meet the Principal\n\non 05.07.2019; the 4th respondent informed them that the petitioner has to vacate\n\nthe hostel as she refused to abide by the rules; Ext.P4 memo dated 05.07.2019 was\n\nissued to her directing her to vacate the hostel immediately; respondents 4 to 6\n\nconvened a meeting of the hostel inmates on 08.07.2019 when the students were\n\ninformed about the action taken against the petitioner based on her request to relax\n\nthe rules and that the inmates were asked to give in writing their willingness to\n\nabide by the restrictions when all the hostel inmates except the petitioner\n\nsubmitted such willingness; on 11.07.2019, Ext.P5 notice was issued to the\n\npetitioner directing her to vacate the hostel within 12 hours; on 15.07.2019, the\n\npetitioner submitted Ext.P6 leave letter for the period from 12.7.2019 on\n\n15.7.2019, as it was not possible for her to attend the classes since she had to travel\n\nnearly 150 km every day; when the petitioner reached the hostel on 15.7.2019 to\n\nvacate her room, it was seen locked and the hostel authorities did not allow her to\n\ntake her belongings.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_2\">      2.     It is stated that the change in duration of the restriction for use of\n\nmobile phone was stated to be effected based on the request of some of the parents.\n\nAccording to the petitioner, she or her parents were never notified of any hostel\n\nmeeting or PTA meeting before the implementation of the rules. It is also her case\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\"> W.P(C).No.19716/2019-L                   5</span>\n\nthat such restrictions are imposed only in the girls hostel and therefore it amounts\n\nto discrimination based on gender, in violation of Clause 5 of Ext.P8 guidelines\n\nissued by UGC, which prohibits gender discrimination. It is also stated that the\n\nUGC (Promotion of Equity in Higher Educational Institutions) Regulations, 2012\n\nmandates the college authorities to take appropriate measures to safeguard the\n\ninterests of the students without subjecting them to discrimination based on\n\ngender, caste, creed, religion, language etc.    Therefore, according to her, the\n\nrestrictions are arbitrary and it impairs the quality of education accessible to\n\nfemale students and it hampers their potential.       It is also stated that such\n\nrestrictions amount to violation of the principles embodied in the Conventions on\n\nElimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, 1979 (&quot;CEDAW&quot;)\n\nand the Beijing Declaration along with Universal Declaration of Human Rights\n\nunder which State parties are to take appropriate measures to prevent\n\ndiscrimination of all forms against women. It is also her contention that such\n\nrestrictions are imposed when the State Government is exploring the possibility of\n\ndigital learning even from the school level, as evident from Ext.P10 Facebook post\n\nof the Minister for Education. It is stated that the Education Department has\n\nintroduced QR Code in text books enabling the students to scan it and read the\n\nlessons and allied topics and watch the videos in their mobile smart phones or\n\ntablets.   It is stated that on account of the expulsion, the study time of the\n\npetitioner is reduced compulsorily because of the time involved for travel. It is\n\nalso her case that she is denied her right to acquire knowledge through internet and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\"> W.P(C).No.19716/2019-L                    6</span>\n\nthat by prohibiting the use of mobile phone, she is deprived of the access to the\n\nsource of knowledge to her detriment which will affect the quality of her\n\neducation. It is claimed that the right to access internet forms a part of freedom of\n\nspeech and expression guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_2\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> and the restrictions\n\nimposed do not come within reasonable restrictions covered by <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_3\">Article 19(2)</a> of the\n\nConstitution of India.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_3\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1875824\" id=\"span_4\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"110813550\" id=\"span_5\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"539407\" id=\"span_6\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"845216\" id=\"span_7\">3.

Relying on the budget speech made by the Minister for finance it is\n\nstated that the State Government has proclaimed steps for making the internet\n\naccessible to all citizens recognizing the right to internet as a human right.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\"> W.P(C).No.19716/2019-L                     7</span>\n\nReferring to the Information Technology Policy of the Government for the year\n\n2017, it is stated that the State Government is adopting mobile first approach for e-\n\ngovernance services in line to Digital Kerala Vision by leveraging high mobile\n\npenetration and coverage in the State.     It is therefore argued that the restrictions\n\nhave invaded her fundamental right to privacy guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_9\">Article 21</a> of the\n\nConstitution of India. Being an adult she claims that nobody has any authority to\n\ninterfere with her freedom to use the mobile phones. It is argued that the forceful\n\nseizure of mobile devices have invaded the right of privacy of the hostel inmates.\n\nIt is also her contention that the modification of rules on the basis of parental\n\nconcern is also an infringement on her personal autonomy as well as that of other\n\ninmates of the hostel.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_6\">      5.     The 4th respondent has filed a counter affidavit. It is stated that the\n\nhostel is run by Sree Narayana Trust and it is under the control of the board of\n\nmanagement. It is stated that the study time for the inmates is prescribed from 6\n\np.m to 8 p.m and from 9 p.m to 10 p.m, as per Ext.R4(a) rules of the hostel. As\n\nper Rule 14 of the Rules, usage of mobile phone is strictly prohibited in the\n\ncollege and hostel. It is stated that the petitioner was admitted in the hostel based\n\non Ext.R4(b) application dated 04.10.2018 in which she along with her father had\n\nsigned agreeing to abide by the rules of the hostel and to obey the directions of the\n\nhostel authorities. It is stated that there is a hostel for women and sports hostel for\n\nmen under the control of the hostel committee, consisting of the Principal,\n\nmembers from the teaching faculty and Deputy Wardens of both the hostels. It is\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\"> W.P(C).No.19716/2019-L                     8</span>\n\nstated that on receiving complaints from parents regarding the excessive usage of\n\nmobile phones in the hostel for women, a meeting was convened on 19.06.2019\n\nin which as per Ext.R4(c) minutes it was unanimously decided to restrict the use of\n\nmobile phones from 6 p.m to 10 p.m from 20.06.2019 onwards in order to see that\n\nstudents are utilising their study time for study purposes only; the decision was\n\ncommunicated to all the inmates of the hostel on 20.06.2019 by the respective\n\nDeputy Wardens/respondents 5 and 6. It is stated that the petitioner had not made\n\nany request explaining any inconvenience on account of the restriction and that\n\nthere was no request from the petitioner or any other inmate to convene any\n\nmeeting. It is stated that though Ext.R4(a) rules prohibited usage of mobile phones\n\nin college and hostel, it was relaxed in the hostel and there was only restrictions in\n\nthe timings for its usage. It is stated that there is no restriction for any student to\n\nuse laptops in the hostels.       It is stated that the petitioner was the only\n\nstudent/inmate, who refused to abide by the instructions to surrender the mobile\n\nphone. It is stated that other inmates complained to respondents 5 and 6 as to the\n\ndisobedience of the petitioner. It is stated that her request to relax the rule was\n\ndeclined, when in Ext.R4(d) letter she stated that she is not ready to follow the\n\ndecision to surrender her mobile phone between 6 p.m and 10 p.m; it was only\n\nthereafter that the 5th respondent contacted her father on 04.07.2019; but her father\n\nspoke to the 5th respondent very arrogantly in total disregard that the 5 th respondent\n\nis a teacher as well as Deputy Warden of the hostel. It is stated that her father\n\ninformed the 5th respondent that he does not have any problem if his daughter used\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\"> W.P(C).No.19716/2019-L                      9</span>\n\nthe mobile phone; the 5 th respondent submitted Ext.R4(e) complaint to the 4 th\n\nrespondent explaining the humiliation she suffered from the petitioner&#x27;s father; it is\n\nstated that her father came to the college on 05.07.2019 and shouted at the 4 th\n\nrespondent in front of the students, parents and other teachers waiting for\n\nadmission procedure, accusing them for having banned the usage of the mobile\n\nphone in the modern age; despite all these, the 4 th respondent did not take any\n\nstringent action against her; the 4 th respondent instructed the 5th respondent to\n\ninform the petitioner that she can either choose to follow the instruction or to leave\n\nthe hostel in case she is not willing to abide by the instructions. It is stated that the\n\npetitioner had given wide publicity to the incident accusing the college authorities\n\nfor having asked her to vacate the hostel for using mobile phone. It is stated that\n\nin the meeting held on 08.07.2019, all other inmates of the hostel, except the\n\npetitioner agreed to surrender the mobile phones between 6 p.m and 10 p.m;\n\ntherefore, she was given 2 days&#x27; time to inform her final decision; It is stated that\n\nout of the 44 students in the hostel excluding the 4 students, who are studying for\n\nB.Ed course/who are on leave, all the remaining 39 students agreed to abide by the\n\ninstructions and to surrender the mobile phone between 6 p.m and 10 p.m. The 4 th\n\nrespondent stated that the petitioner was not asked to vacate the hostel within 12\n\nhours as alleged. It is also stated that as per Ext.R4(g) minutes of the executive\n\nmeeting of the PTA        held on 12.07.2019, it was decided to implement the\n\nrestriction imposing the usage of the mobile phone. It is also stated that her parent\n\nbehaved rudely with the Vice President of the PTA also who was deputed to talk to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\"> W.P(C).No.19716/2019-L                     10</span>\n\nhim. According to the 4th respondent, when the petitioner and her parent had\n\nsigned the application Ext.R4(a) agreeing to abide by the instructions, she or her\n\nparent are not expected to object to the same. It is stated that there is restriction in\n\nthe boys hostel also in the usage of mobile phone, which is between 6 a.m and 9\n\na.m and from 4 p.m to 6.30 p.m except on Sundays and from 10 p.m on all days.\n\nAccording to the 4th respondent, the college is having a full-fledged library with\n\nmore than 30,000 books which the students can utilise and therefore acquiring\n\nknowledge through internet alone between 6 p.m and 10 p.m cannot be said to be\n\nan unreasonable restriction.

Karnataka State Small Industries Corporation: (1998) 3 SCC\n\n732 etc. it is stated that supreme authority to control and enforce discipline in an\n\neducational institution is the head of the institution; the authorities of the college as\n\nwell as the hostel are entitled to take suitable measure to maintain discipline; it is\n\nthe duty of the members of the teaching staff to take appropriate measures to\n\nachieve excellence in education; it is the duty of the institution which imparts\n\neducation, to maintain discipline and to enforce the rules and regulations which are\n\nlawfully framed, stating that the rules are not designed to curtail any fundamental\n\nright. It is further stated that in case the petitioner wants to gather knowledge\n\nthrough internet, she is free to use laptop for which there is no restriction.

The Executive Director of Software, who got impleaded in the Writ\n\nPetition, has filed a counter affidavit stating that restriction in usage of mobile\n\nphones and laptops in hostel premises is an invasion of the the right of the girl\n\nstudents to acquire knowledge through digital resources. It is stated that internet\n\nprovides access to any information at the touch of a button; there has been a rise of\n\nmassive online open course platform through which the people across the world\n\ncan access various educational courses taught by professional teachers; when the\n\nquantum of knowledge available online is increasing every day, arbitrary\n\nrestriction to access the information puts the female inmates of the college at a\n\nserious disadvantage compared to male inmates as well as the students of the same\n\nclass, who are not the inmates of the hostel and of other colleges and it amounts to\n\na restriction on the right to freedom of speech and expression as held in <a href=\"/doc/539407/\" id=\"a_10\">Ministry\n\nof Information and Broadcasting v. Cricket Association of Bengal &amp; anr</a>: AIR\n\n1995 SC 1236]. It is stated that as per Ext.R4(a) rules the inmates of the hostel\n\ncannot use mobile phones from 6 p.m to 10 p.m and they have to switch off the\n\nelectric lights by 10 p.m, invading their right to freedom and the right to privacy of\n\nthe inmates who are adults.

It is therefore\n\nstated that such restrictions would deprive the students of their opportunity to\n\nhave access to the SWAYAM platform. It is their further contention that access to\n\ninternet is mainly done through mobile phones due to nonavailability of wi-fi\n\nfacility in the hostel.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"125596\" id=\"span_16\">Relying on the judgment in <a href=\"/doc/125596/\" id=\"a_11\">Bennett Coleman &amp; Ors. v.\n\nUnion of India</a>: AIR 1973 SC 106, it is stated that the restrictions are outside the\n\nambit of <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_12\">Article 19(2).</a> It is stated that as per the study and survey conducted by\n\nUNESCO, women are at a disadvantaged position in terms of internet access and\n\n70% of the users are men.

According to the additional 7th respondent, the\n\nrestriction imposed on usage of mobile phones, just because the students are\n\nstaying in a hostel run by the college, is without any authority. It is also stated that\n\nthe confiscation of mobile phones is in violation of their right to privacy as well as\n\ntheir right to property under <a href=\"/doc/120077007/\" id=\"a_13\">Art.300A.</a></span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_8\">      7.

The question to be considered is whether the restrictions imposed by\n\nthe hostel authorities on use of mobile phones while enforcing discipline has\n\ninfringed the fundamental rights of the petitioner, even assuming that such\n\nmodification was brought about at the request from the parents.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_10\">      9.     A student is admitted in a hostel based on her application in which she\n\nherself as well as her parent would have furnished a declaration agreeing to abide\n\nby the rules and regulations already issued and the instructions which would be\n\nissued from time to time by the authorities. From the impugned restriction against\n\nusing mobile phones during 6 pm to 10 pm from 20.06.2019 would show that the\n\ntotal prohibition of mobile phones prescribed in the rules was never acted upon.\n\nHowever in the light of the contention of the respondent college that it is upto the\n\nstudents to stay in the hostel strictly abiding the rules and instructions or else they\n\nare free to leave the hostel, it is necessary to examine whether a student has got a\n\nright to stay in a hostel and whether the college has got any obligation to permit a\n\nstudent to stay in the hostel. Chapter 7 of the Calicut University First Ordinances,\n\n1978 provides for residence of students. Clause 3 thereof provides that every\n\ncollege shall provide residential quarters to such percentage of students as the\n\nsyndicate may decide from time to time. Clause 4 provides that every student not\n\nresiding with his/her parents or guardian shall be required to reside in any of the\n\nhostels maintained by the University or by the institutions affiliated to the\n\nUniversity or in hostels or lodgings recognized by the University. It also provides\n\nthat syndicate shall maintain a register of recognized hostels and lodgings. Clause\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\"> W.P(C).No.19716/2019-L                      14</span>\n\n17 provides that every student shall inform the Principal his place of residence and\n\nshall also report the change of residence, if any. As per Clause 7 it is the duty of\n\nthe managing council/governing bodies of the college to manage the collegiate\n\nhostel. There shall be a warden in every such hostel, a superintendent or proprietor\n\nworking under the immediate direction, control or supervision of the Principal of\n\nthe college. Students living in such hostels shall be under the disciplinary control\n\nof the warden, superintendent or proprietor, as the case may be. For every 50\n\nstudents in a hostel, there shall be one resident tutor or assistant warden. The\n\nPrincipals of the college concerned have to frame rules for their collegiate hostel\n\nand get it approved by the syndicate. Students who have been rusticated shall not\n\nbe permitted to reside in a recognized hostel or lodging during the period of\n\nrustication . Therefore, going by the aforesaid provisions the students have a right\n\nto residence in the college hostel/a hostel recognised by the syndicate and the\n\ncollege has an obligation to provide accommodation in the hostel, to the students\n\nwho are residing far away from the college/away from their parents. The\n\nprovisions in the ordinance also provide that every student residing in the hostel\n\nwould       be      subject    to     the        disciplinary   control    of     the\n\nwarden/superintendent/proprietor of the hostel. It is well settled proposition, in the\n\nlight of a series of judgments like Unnirajas&#x27; case (supra), Manu Vilson&#x27;s case,\n\nSojan Francis&#x27; case, Indulekha Joseph&#x27;s case (supra), etc., that the Principal of\n\nthe College is the supreme authority to control the students and to enforce\n\ndiscipline in the college. Similar is the case with the hostel also, where the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\"> W.P(C).No.19716/2019-L                    15</span>\n\nauthority would be the warden as well as Principal. Though instructions are to be\n\nobeyed by the inmates, is there any justification in imposing such restrictions.\n\nHowever in this case the question to be examined is whether such enforcement of\n\ndiscipline by restricting the use of mobile phones would result in curtailing the\n\nright of the students to acquire knowledge by different means. Using of mobile\n\nphones by itself would not cause any harm to anyone. If a restriction is\n\nunreasonable and arbitrary and infringes the fundamental right of an inmate, it\n\ncannot be said that the student has to abide by such restriction, especially when the\n\ninmate is an adult.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_11\">      10.    It is therefore necessary to examine whether usage of mobile phone\n\nduring 6 pm to 10 pm would amount to indiscipline and whether the refusal to\n\nabide by the instruction in using it should result in expulsion from the hostel. It is\n\nstated that the object behind introducing such a restriction is to see that the\n\nstudents are utilising their study time for study purposes alone. The respondents\n\nhave not stated whether usage of mobile phone by the petitioner or by any inmate\n\ncaused any disturbance to other inmates. Therefore, indiscipline comes only to the\n\nextent of disobedience of an instruction. Then the question is whether an\n\ninstruction or restriction can stand in the way of acquiring knowledge by the\n\ninmates.    It is also necessary to examine whether they can utilise the study time\n\nfor study purposes using the mobile phones also, in this advanced world of\n\ntechnology. The college authorities as well as parents should be conscious of the\n\nfact that the students in a college hostel are adults who are capable of taking\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\"> W.P(C).No.19716/2019-L                    16</span>\n\ndecisions as to how and when they have to study. It is a fact that there is large\n\nscale misuse of mobile phones; but that misuse can happen with laptops also; it\n\ncan be even before 6 pm and 10 pm, before and after the study time.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_12\">      11.    The mobile phones which were unheard of once and later a luxury has\n\nnow become part and parcel of the day to day life and even to a stage that it is\n\nunavoidable to survive with dignity and freedom. Though initially it was a mere\n\nreplacement of land phone enabling one to connect another and talk, on the advent\n\nof internet the connectivity became so wide. On availability of more and more\n\nfacilities, since the year 1998, the number of users gradually increased and as at\n\npresent India stands 2nd in the world in the usage of internet. The facilities to\n\naccess internet, which was initially possible only through desk top computers, later\n\nin laptop, is now available in mobile phones which are handy and portable; with\n\nmore and more applications,         connectivity became feasible for        everyone\n\neverywhere even among the common man. Apart from the facilities to read E-news\n\npapers, e-books, etc. one can undergo online courses also sitting at home or hostel\n\nand it is pointed out that there are courses under SWAYAM recognized by the\n\nUGC, which students can undergo even when they are undergoing regular studies\n\nin colleges. Though the respondent college has stated that there is no restriction for\n\nthe inmates to use laptops, all the students would not be ordinarily able to afford to\n\nhave a laptop in addition to mobile phone. Assuming that the purpose is to prevent\n\nmisuse of mobile phones during study time, such misuse is quite possible with\n\nlaptops also. Thus the purpose of such restriction would not be achieved. It would\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\"> W.P(C).No.19716/2019-L                     17</span>\n\nnot be proper for the college authorities to impose such restrictions on students of\n\nthe college going age even if it is at the request of parents, in their anxiety to see\n\nthat their children are studying and not being misdirected through mobile phones.\n\nIt is a well known fact that these phones as well as the modern technologies are\n\nprone to misuse. At the same time, the college authorities as well as the parents\n\ncannot be permitted to shut their eyes on the innumerable advantages out of\n\ninternet on various aspects of learning with world wide connectivity, on its proper\n\nusage.         Apart from facilities for interaction, exchange of ideas or group\n\ndiscussions, there are several methods by which the devices can be usefully\n\nutilised by its proper use by downloading of data or e-books or undergoing other\n\ncourses, simultaneously utilising the facilities under the Swayam program of UGC,\n\netc; knowledge can be gathered by adopting the method which one chooses. When\n\none student may be interested in garnering knowledge by reference of books in\n\nlibraries, one may be interested in referring to e-books or downloading data.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_13\">         12.     By compelling one that she should utilise the books in the library\n\nduring the study time or that she should not access the technological means during\n\na particular time or study time may not always yield positive results. A student\n\nabove the age of 18 years shall be given the freedom to choose the mode for her\n\nstudies provided it does not cause any disturbance to others. The schools in Kerala\n\npromotes digitalisation with smart class rooms and the modern technology has\n\ntaken its place in all the fields even from primary section. Thus the usage of\n\nmobile phones in order to enable the students to have access to internet will only\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\"> W.P(C).No.19716/2019-L                            18</span>\n\nenhance the opportunities of students to acquire knowledge from all available\n\nsources based on which they can achieve excellence and enhance quality and\n\nstandard of education.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_14\">      13.

In the judgment in Puttaswamy&#x27;s case (supra) the Apex Court held\n\nthat right to privacy is held to be an intrinsic part of the right to life, personal\n\nliberty and dignity and hence a fundamental right under part III of the\n\nConstitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_27\">      17.     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"341773\" id=\"span_31\">In the judgement in <a href=\"/doc/341773/\" id=\"a_26\">S.Rengarajan and others v.

It was held that freedom of expression cannot be suppressed on\n\naccount of threat of demonstration and processions or threats of violence which\n\nwould tantamount to negation of the rule of law and the surrender to blackmail and\n\nintimidation.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_28\">      18.    Though it is true that the Principal of the college is the supreme\n\nauthority to enforce discipline as held by this Court in Manu Wilson&#x27;s case, Sojan\n\nFrancis&#x27; case, Indulekha Joseph&#x27;s case (supra) and that there cannot be any\n\ndispute that rules and regulations lawfully framed are to be obeyed by the students\n\nand that teachers are like foster parents who are required to look after, cultivate\n\nand guide the students in their pursuit of education for maintaining excellence of\n\neducation, the rules should be modified in tune with the modernisation of the\n\ntechnology so as to enable the students to acquire knowledge from all available\n\nsources. It would be open to the authorities in the hostel to supervise whether any\n\ndistraction or disturbance is caused to other students on account of usage of mobile\n\nphone or take action when any such complaint is received. The total restriction on\n\nits use and the direction to surrender it during the study hours is absolutely\n\nunwarranted. When the Human Rights Council of the United Nations have found\n\nthat right to access to Internet is a fundamental freedom and a tool to ensure right\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\"> W.P(C).No.19716/2019-L                     24</span>\n\nto education, a rule or instruction which impairs the said right of the students\n\ncannot be permitted to stand in the eye of law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_29\">      19.    It is pertinent to note that the learned counsel for the college\n\nvehemently argued that in the absence of any challenge to the rules and\n\nregulations, the petitioner cannot be heard to challenge the action taken in\n\naccordance with the rules. The learned counsel for the college also argued that in\n\nthe light of the judgment of the Full Bench of this Xourt in Pavitran V.K. M V\n\nState of Kerala &amp; others: 2009(4) KLT 20: 2009(4) KHC 4 , the rules and\n\nregulations of the hostel will stand as long as it is not set aside. But in this case the\n\nrule was that the mobile phones shall not be used in the hostel. Therefore, what\n\nremains is only the decision/instruction restricting/banning the use of mobile\n\nphone from 6 pm to 10 pm and the direction to surrender the mobile phone to the\n\nwarden. When it is already found that such an action infringes the fundamental\n\nfreedom as well as privacy and will adversely affect the future and career of\n\nstudents who want to acquire knowledge and compete with their peers, such\n\ninstruction or restriction cannot be permitted to be enforced.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_30\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"180659644\" id=\"span_34\">20.    While enforcing discipline it is necessary to see the positive aspects of\n\nthe mobile phone also. As held by this Court in the judgment in <a href=\"/doc/180659644/\" id=\"a_29\">Anjitha K.Jose&#x27;</a>\n\ncase (supra), the restriction should have connection with the discipline and when\n\nthere is nothing to show that there was any act of indiscipline on account of the\n\nusage of mobile phone by the petitioner, that cannot stand. The fact that no other\n\nstudent objected to the restriction or that all others obeyed the instructions will not\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\"> W.P(C).No.19716/2019-L                     25</span>\n\nmake a restriction legal if it is otherwise illegal. No student shall be compelled\n\neither to use mobile phone or not to use mobile phone. It is for each of the\n\nstudents to decide with self confidence and self determination that she would not\n\nmisuse it and that she would use it only for improving her quality of education.</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_31\">      21.    The parents as well as the authorities of the hostel have to consider the\n\nfact that almost all the undergraduate students staying in the hostel have attained\n\nmajority. They have joined the course after passing one or two public\n\nexaminations. The students in that age group are expected to be conscious of their\n\nduty to study properly in exercise of their right to education. The manner in which\n\nas well as the time during which each person can study well, vary from person to\n\nperson.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_32\">      22.    I am of the view that what is required is a counselling for the students,\n\nas well as parents in the colleges. The students in the hostels should be given\n\ncounselling in order to inculcate in them self restraint in the usage of mobile\n\nphones, to make them capable of choosing the right path, to make them aware of\n\nthe consequence of misuse as well as advantage of its proper use. It should be left\n\nto the students to choose the time for using mobile phone. The only restriction that\n\ncan be imposed is that they should not cause any disturbance to other students.\n\nWhile acting in exercise of right to privacy, persons like the petitioner shall also\n\nsee that such exercise does not invade the right to privacy of another student\n\nresiding in the hostel especially in her room.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_33\">      23.    At any rate, it is not fair on the part of a parent to shout at the teachers\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\"> W.P(C).No.19716/2019-L                    26</span>\n\nor warden or Principal if at all their action was not acceptable to him. Such\n\npractices of humiliating the teachers, that too, in front of the students and the\n\npublic is not fair or proper and is not expected from educated parents and hence\n\ndeprecated.        However, what is to be considered in this case is the\n\nunreasonableness of the restriction consequent to which the petitioner is expelled.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_34\">      24.     Regarding the contention of the respondent that any inmate is bound\n\nto abide by the rules and regulations or else she is free to leave the hostel, it is\n\npertinent to note that rules and regulations require reforms to cope up with the\n\nadvancement of technology and the importance of modern technology in day to\n\nday life. As per the University Regulations as well as the UGC Regulations, the\n\ncollege is bound to run a hostel to enable the students to reside near the college in\n\norder to enable them to have sufficient time to concentrate in their studies.\n\nTherefore, the hostel authorities are expected to enforce only those rules and\n\nregulations for enforcing discipline. Enforcement of discipline shall not be by\n\nblocking the ways and means of the students to acquire knowledge.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_35\">      25.     In view of the aforesaid reasons, I am of the view that imposing of\n\nsuch restrictions is unreasonable and therefore the respondent shall re-admit the\n\npetitioner in the hostel without any further delay.      It is made clear that the\n\npetitioner or her parent shall not do any act in a manner humiliating any of the\n\nrespondents or any other teacher or warden or Matron in the hostel/college. The\n\npetitioner or any other inmate shall also see that no disturbance is caused to others\n\nby usage of mobile phone in the hostel.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\"> W.P(C).No.19716/2019-L                    27</span><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_36\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_37\">              The Writ Petition is allowed to the above extent.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_38\">                                                                          Sd/-\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_39\">\n                                                                  (P.V.ASHA, JUDGE)\n\nrtr/\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\"> W.P(C).No.19716/2019-L             28</span>\n\n\n\n\n                             APPENDIX\nPETITIONER&#x27;S EXHIBITS:\n</p>\n<pre id=\"pre_2\">EXHIBIT P1               COPY OF SCREENSHOT OF THE WHATSAPP MESSAGE\n                         DATED 24.6.2019 SENT BY 5TH RESPONDENT TO\n                         THE HOSTEL GROUP &quot;NITHYAHARITHAM&quot;.\n\nEXHIBIT P2               COPY OF THE LETTER DATED 3.7.2019 SUBMITTED\n                         BY THE PETITIONER TO THE 4TH RESPONDENT.\n\nEXHIBIT P3               TRUE COPY OF THE LETTER DATED 3.7.2019\n                         SUBMITTED BY THE PETITIONER TO THE 4TH\n                         RESPONDENT.\n\nEXHIBIT P4               COPY OF THE COMMUNICATION DATED 4.7.2019\n                         AND 5.7.2019 BETWEEN THE 4TH AND 5TH\n                         RESPONDENTS, DIRECTING THE PETITIONER TO\n                         IMMEDIATELY VACATE THE HOSTEL.\n\nEXHIBIT P5               COPY OF NOTICE DATED 11.7.2019 ISSUED BY\n                         THE 4TH RESPONDENT.\n\nEXHIBIT P6               COPY OF THE LEAVE LETTER DATED 15.7.2019\n                         SUBMITTED BY THE PETITIONER.\n\nEXHIBIT P7               COPY OF APPLICATION DATED 10.7.2019 FILED\n                         UNDER THE RIGHT TO INFORMATION ACT, 2005.\n\nEXHIBIT P8               COPY OF UGC STUDENT ENTITLEMENT GUIDELINES.\n\nEXHIBIT P9               COPY OF UGC (PROMOTION OF EQUITY IN HIGHER\n                         EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS) REGULATIONS,\n                         2012.\n\nEXHIBIT P10              COPY OF THE FACEBOOK POST DATED 5.7.2019 OF\n                         THE MINISTER FOR EDUCATION OF STATE OF\n                         KERALA.\n\n\nESPONDENT&#x27;S EXHIBITS:\n\nEXHIBIT-R4(a)            TRUE COPY OF THE RELEVANT PAGES OF THE\n                         HOSTEL RULES\n\nEXHIBIT-R4(b)            TRUE COPY OF THE APPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n                         TO THE HOSTEL FOR WOMEN DATED 04/10/2018\n\nEXHIBIT-R4(c)            TRUE COPY OF THE MINUTES OF THE MEETING\n                         HELD ON 19/06/2019\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\"> W.P(C).No.19716/2019-L             29</span>\n\n\n\n\nEXHIBIT-R4(d)            TRUE COPY OF THE LETTER RECEIVED FROM THE\n                         PETITIONER DATED 03/07/2019\n\nEXHIBIT-R4(e)            TRUE COPY OF THE COMPLAINT FILED BY THE 5TH\n                         RESPONDENT DATED 05/07/2019 TO THE\n                         PRINCIPAL\n\nEXHIBIT-R4(f)            TRUE COPY OF THE MINUTES OF THE MEETING\n                         DATED 08/07/2019\n\nEXHIBIT-R4(g)            TRUE COPY OF THE MINUTES OF THE MEETING OF\n                         THE PTA EXECUTIVE DATED 12/07/2019\n\n\nEXHIBIT-R4(h)            TRUE COPY OF THE REMINDER LETTER DATED\n                         17.07.2019 ISSUED BY THE PRINCIPAL.\n\nEXHIBIT-R4(i)            TRUE COPY OF THE LETTER BY THE DEPUTY\n                         WARDEN IN CHARGE OF THE BOYS&#x27;
