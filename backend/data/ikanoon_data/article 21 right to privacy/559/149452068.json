The autonomy\n                    of the individual was defined as &quot;the ability to make\n                    decision on vital matters of concern to life.&quot; The\n                    judgement\n                      dgement delivered on behalf of four judges described the\n                    right to privacy in the following terms:\n                    &quot;297. ... Privacy postulates the reservation of a private\n                    space for the individual, described as the right to be let\n                    alone. The concept is founded on the autono\n                                                         autonomy\n                                                                my of the\n                    individual. The ability of an individual to make choices lies\n                    at the core of the human personality. The notion of privacy\n                    enables the individual to assert and control the human\n                    element which is inseparable from the personality of the\n                    individual. The inviolable nature of the human personality\n                    is manifested in the ability to make decisions on matters\n                    intimate to human life. The autonomy of the individual is\n                    associated over matters which can be kept private. These\n                    are concerns over which there is a llegitimate\n                                                         egitimate expectation\n                    of privacy.
