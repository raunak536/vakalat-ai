The present writ petition is directed against the decision of the\n\nCentral Information Commission (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;CIC&quot;)\n\ndated 12.01.2011 passed in Appeal No. CIC/WB/A/2009/001004- SM,\n\npreferred under <a href=\"/doc/593162/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 19</a> of the Right to Information Act, 2005,\n\n(hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Act&quot;) whereby the petitioner has been\n\ndirected to provide the relevant records in its possession as sought by\n\nthe Respondent herein.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">W.P.

The respondent by an application filed under <a href=\"/doc/1910806/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 6</a> of the\n\nAct, sought the following Information from the petitioner:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">       &quot;A. Please provide inspection of the records, documents,\n       note sheets, manuscripts, records, reports, office\n       memorandum, part files and files relating to the proposed\n       disciplinary action and/or imposition of penalty against Shri\n       G.S. Narang, IRS, Central Excise and customs Officer of\n       1974 Batch and also inspection of records, files, etc.,\n       relating to the decision of the UPSC thereof. Shri G.S.\n       Narang is presently posted as Director General of\n       Inspection Customs and Central Excise.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">       B.    Please provide copies of all the note sheets and the\n       final decision taken regarding imposition of penalty/\n       disciplinary action and decision of the UPSC thereof.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">3.     The Central Public Information Officer (CPIO) of the petitioner,\n\nhowever, declined to provide the same on the ground that the\n\ninformation sought pertained to the disciplinary case of Shri G. S.\n\nNarang, which was of personal nature, disclosure of which has no\n\nrelationship to any public activity or interest. It further stated that the\n\ndisclosure of the same may infringe upon the privacy of the individual\n\nand that it may not be in the larger interest. The petitioner, therefore,\n\nclaimed exemption from disclosing the information under <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_3\">Section\n\n8(1)(j)</a> of the Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_7\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">4.     The Respondent, consequently, filed an appeal under <a href=\"/doc/593162/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 19</a>\n\nof the Act, before the 1st Appellate Authority of the Petitioner. The\n\nAppellate Authority dismissed the Appeal on the same ground that the\n\ninformation sought was exempted from disclosure under <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 8(1)(j)</a>\n\nof the Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_9\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">W.P. (C) No. 1243/2011                                           Page 2 of 32</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\"> 5.     Being aggrieved by the said decision, the Respondent preferred\n\nan appeal before the CIC. Setting aside the decision of the „First\n\nAppellate Authority‟, the CIC held as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">       &quot;4. After carefully considering the facts of the case and the\n       submissions made by both parties, we are of the view that\n       the CPIO was not right in denying this information. As far\n       as the UPSC is concerned, the Respondent informed,\n       it receives references from the Ministries and\n       Departments in disciplinary matters to give its\n       comments and recommendations on individual\n       cases. In this case too, the UPSC had been consulted\n       and that it had offered its comments and views to\n       the Government. Whatever records it holds in\n       regard to this case will have to be disclosed because\n       this cannot be classified as personal information\n       merely on the ground that it concerns some\n       particular officer. Our attention was drawn to a Division\n       Bench ruling by the High Court of Kerala in the WA No.\n       2781/2009 in which the Court had held that the\n       information sought by an employee, from his employer, in\n       respect of domestic enquiry and confidential reports of his\n       colleagues would not amount to personal information as\n       provided under <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the Right to Information\n       (RTI) Act. In other words, information regarding the\n       disciplinary matters against any employee cannot be\n       withheld by claiming it to be personal Information.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">       5.    In the light of the above, we direct the CPIO to\n       invite the Appellant on any mutually convenient\n       date within 15 working days from the receipt of this\n       order and to show him the relevant records in the\n       possession of the UPSC for his inspection. After\n       Inspection, if the Appellant chooses to get the photocopies\n       of some of those records, the CPIO shall provide the same\n       free of cost.&quot; (emphasis supplied)\n\n\n\nPetitioner&#x27;s Submissions\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">6.     The Petitioner assails the decision of the CIC, in the present writ\n\npetition,    on   several   grounds.   The   Petitioner   submits   that   the\n\ninformation sought by the Respondent at point „A‟ of his RTI application\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">W.P.

It is stated by the Petitioner that the said\n\ninformation        relates   to   the       actions    of   the   concerned       Ministry/\n\nDepartment and as such no record thereof is available or held with the\n\nPetitioner.    As     regards     rest      of   the   Information       sought     by   the\n\nRespondent, it is submitted that the same is exempt from disclosure\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1494553/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 8(1)(e)</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1535548/\" id=\"a_8\">8(1)(g)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_9\">8(1)(j)</a> of the Act.

The Petitioner claims exemption under <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 8 (1)(j)</a> of the Act\n\non the basis that the disclosure of the information sought would cause\n\nunwarranted invasion of the privacy of the concerned charged officer.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_11\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"916458\" id=\"span_5\">The Petitioner also submits that disclosure would not serve any larger\n\npublic interest and would rather expose and make public- vulnerable\n\nand sensitive information relating to third party(s). The petitioner\n\nsubmits that the CIC erred in relying upon the decision of the Kerala\n\nHigh Court in WA No. 2781/2009 titled Centre for <a href=\"/doc/916458/\" id=\"a_13\">Earth Science\n\nStudies vs. Dr. Mrs. Anson Sebastian &amp; the State Information\n\nCommission</a>.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_12\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1548289\" id=\"span_6\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"182742167\" id=\"span_7\">8.     It is submitted by the Petitioner that the information sought for\n\nby the Respondent includes not only information that is personal to a\n\nthird party i.e. the charged officer, but also contains information\n\nrelating to the particular views and opinions of persons/ officers who\n\ncontributed to the disciplinary proceedings against the charged officer.\n\nThis opinion was given in trust and confidence and as such is held by\n\nthe Petitioner in its fiduciary capacity, and is thereby exempt under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1494553/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 8(1)(e)</a> of the Act. It is submitted that file notings pertaining to\n\ndisciplinary cases are exempt from disclosure under the aforesaid\n\nsection. To further his submission, the petitioner has <a href=\"/doc/916458/\" id=\"a_15\">placed reliance\n\nupon</a> the judgment of this Court in W.P.

Further, it is submitted that the disclosure of such information\n\nbesides endangering the life and safety of the persons concerned, will\n\nalso disclose the assistance that was given by the officers during the\n\nDisciplinary proceeding for enforcement of law. Consequently, it is\n\nargued, that the disclosure of the information sought would be exempt\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1535548/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 8(1)(g)</a> of the Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_16\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">10.    The Petitioner contends that order of the CIC is unsustainable in\n\nlaw in as much, as, it is contrary to the decisions of the concurrent\n\nBenches of the CIC. Moreover, it has rendered its decision while this\n\nCourt is seized of a similar issue in W.P. (C) No. 13205/2009 titled\n\nUPSC vs. C.L. Sharma.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_18\">\nRespondent&#x27;s Submissions\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_19\">11.     The Respondent, on the other hand, has at the outset submitted\n\nthat the CIC has merely directed the disclosure of the records in\n\npossession of the UPSC. It has not directed the Petitioner to procure\n\nrecords from the concerned Ministries or Departments and then to\n\nmake them available to the Respondent for inspection.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_20\">12.    The Respondent submits that the information directed to be\n\ndisclosed to the Respondent, by the Impugned order, is not exempted\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">W.P. (C) No. 1243/2011                                        Page 6 of 32</span>\n under <a href=\"/doc/1494553/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 8 (1)(e)</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1535548/\" id=\"a_20\">8(1)(g)</a>, or      8(1)(j) of the Act. It is further\n\nsubmitted that the CPIO and the first Appellate Authority had merely\n\nclaimed exemption under <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the Act, and that the\n\nPetitioner cannot, at this stage, be permitted to introduce new grounds\n\nby claiming exemption under <a href=\"/doc/1535548/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 8(1)(g)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1494553/\" id=\"a_23\">8(1)(e)</a> of the Act. It\n\nis also contented that there is no fiduciary relationship involved in the\n\npresent case and the disclosure of information would not endanger the\n\nlife and safety of anyone. Hence, the information sought is not exempt\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1494553/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 8(1)(e)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1535548/\" id=\"a_25\">8(1)(g)</a> of the Act. It is also submitted that\n\nthe exemption under <a href=\"/doc/1494553/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 8(1)(e)</a> and (j) is not available as it would\n\nbe in the larger public interest to disclose the same.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_21\">13.       As regards the exemption under <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 8(1)(j)</a>, it is submitted\n\nby the Respondent that disclosure of the information permitted by the\n\nimpugned order relates to the public activity of public servants. It can,\n\nby no stretch of imagination, be treated as personal information of a\n\nPublic Servant. The information sought is not personal information\n\nrelating to a third party, but is contained in the records of the UPSC\n\nitself.    It is further submitted that the disclosure of the information\n\nsought is in the larger public interest, since the case not only relates to\n\nserious irregularities committed in the administration of taxation cases\n\nand adjudication of offence, but also involves different opinions given\n\nby two public authorities, i.e. the Central Vigilance Commission and the\n\nPetitioner on the basis of the same records, thereby making it\n\nnecessary to see whether same or different records were produced or\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">W.P. (C) No. 1243/2011                                           Page 7 of 32</span>\n any part of the records were withheld from or by the Petitioner, and\n\nalso whether a proper method and procedure was adopted by the\n\nPetitioner.    It   is   contented   that   the   disclosure   would    promote\n\ntransparency and accountability, thereby adding to the credibility to\n\nthe Petitioner itself.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_22\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_23\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"916458\" id=\"span_11\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"182742167\" id=\"span_12\">14.      The Respondent submits that the judgment of this Court in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/182742167/\" id=\"a_28\">Ravinder Kumar</a> (Supra), relied upon by the petitioner, have no\n\napplicability to the present case and that the CIC has rightly followed\n\nthe judgment of the Kerala High Court in Centre for <a href=\"/doc/916458/\" id=\"a_29\">Earth Science\n\nStudies</a> (Supra).</span></span> It is also submitted that the mere pendency of some\n\nsimilar matter before this Court would not preclude the CIC to decide\n\nthe appeal pending before it.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_24\">\nDiscussion\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_25\">15.      The principal contention of the Petitioner, right from the stage\n\nwhen the RTI application was considered by the CPIO up till the stage\n\nof consideration of the Second Appeal before the CIC, was that the\n\ninformation sought for by the Respondent is exempted from disclosure\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the Act. Therefore, I proceed to deal with it\n\nfirst.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_26\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_27\">16.      The exemption under <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> is available in respect of\n\n„personal information‟ of an individual. For the exemption to come\n\ninto operation, the personal information sought:\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">W.P.

The word „personal‟ means appertaining to the person; belonging\n\nto an individual; limited to the person; having the nature or partaking\n\nof the qualities of human beings, or of movable property. [See Black&#x27;s\n\nLaw Dictionary, Sixth Edition].\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_29\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_30\">18.    The word „information‟ is defined in <a href=\"/doc/1516599/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 2(f)</a> of the Act as\n\nmeaning:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">       &quot;any material in any form, including records, documents,\n       memos, e-mails, opinions, advices, press releases,\n       circulars, orders, logbooks, contracts, reports, papers,\n       samples, models, data material held in any electronic form\n       and information relating to any private body which can be\n       accessed by a public authority under any other law for the\n       time being in force&quot;.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_31\">19.    Therefore, &quot;personal information&quot; under the Act, would be\n\ninformation, as set forth above, that pertains to a person. As such it\n\ntakes into its fold possibly every kind of information relating to the\n\nperson. Now, such personal information of the person may, or may not,\n\nhave relation to any public activity, or to public interest. At the same\n\ntime, such personal information may, or may not, be private to the\n\nperson.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_32\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">W.P.

If one were to seek\n\ninformation about himself, the question of invasion of his own privacy\n\nwould not arise. It would only arise where the information sought\n\nrelates to a third party.

Further, the personal information cannot be that of a &quot;public\n\nauthority&quot;. No public authority can claim that any information held by\n\nit is personal to it. There is nothing &quot;personal&quot; about any information\n\nheld by a public authority in relation to itself. The expression &quot;personal\n\ninformation&quot; used in <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> means information personal to any\n\n&quot;person&quot;, that the public authority may hold. For instance, a public\n\nauthority may in connection with its functioning require any other\n\nperson to provide information which may be personal to that person. It\n\nis that information, pertaining to that other person, which the public\n\nauthority may refuse to disclose, if the information sought satisfies the\n\nconditions set out in clause (j) of <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 8(1)</a> of the Act, i.e., if such\n\ninformation has no relationship to any public activity (of the person\n\nwho has provided the information, or who is the source of the\n\ninformation, or to whom that information pertains), or to public\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">W.P.

The\n\nuse of the words &quot;invasion of the privacy of the individual&quot;, instead of\n\n&quot;an individual&quot;, shows that the legislative intent was to connect the\n\nexpression &quot;personal information&quot; with the word &quot;individual&quot;.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_35\">22.    Merely because information that may be personal to a third party\n\nis held by a public authority, a querist does not become entitled to\n\naccess it, unless the said personal information has a relationship to a\n\npublic activity of the third person (to whom it relates), or to public\n\ninterest. If it is private informtaion (i.e. it is personal information which\n\nimpinges on the privacy of the third party), its disclosure would not be\n\nmade unless larger public interest dictates it. Therefore, for example,\n\na querist cannot seek the personal or private particulars provided by a\n\nthird party in his application made to the passport authorities in his\n\napplication to obtain a passport, merely because such information is\n\navailable with the passport authorities, which is a public authority\n\nunder the Act. The querist must make out a case (in his application\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1910806/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 6</a> of the Act) justifying the disclosure of the information\n\nsought on the touchstone of clause (j) of <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 8(1)</a> of the Act.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_36\">23.    Proceeding further, I now examine the expressions „Public\n\nactivity‟, „Public interest‟ and „Privacy of the individual‟ used in <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_39\">Section\n\n8(1)(j)</a> of the Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_37\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">W.P.

There is an inherent public interest involved in the discharge\n\nof such activities, as all public duties are expected to be discharged in\n\npublic interest. Consequently, information of a person which is related\n\nto, or has a bearing on his public activities, is not exempt from\n\ndisclosure under the scheme and provisions of the Act, whose primary\n\nobject is to ensure an informed citizenry and transparency of\n\ninformation and also to contain corruption. For example, take the case\n\nof a surgeon employed in a Government Hospital who performs\n\nsurgeries on his patients who are coming to the government hospital.\n\nHis personal information, relating to discharge of his public duty, i.e.\n\nhis public activity, is not exempt from disclosure under the Act. Such\n\ninformation could include information relating to his physical and\n\nmental health, his qualifications etc., as the said information has a\n\nbearing on the discharge of his public duty, but would not include his\n\nother personal information such as, his taste in music, sport, art, his\n\nfamily, his family background etc., which has no bearing/relation to his\n\nact of performing his duties as a surgeon.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_39\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_40\">25.    &quot;Public interest&quot; is also a ground for taking away the exemption\n\nfrom disclosure of personal information. Therefore, a querist may seek\n\npersonal information of a person from a public authority in public\n\ninterest. The second half of the first part of clause (j) of <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 8(1)</a>\n\nshows that when personal information in respect of a person is sought,\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">W.P. (C) No. 1243/2011                                        Page 12 of 32</span>\n the authority concerned shall weigh the competing claims i.e., the\n\nclaim for the protection of personal information of the concerned\n\nperson on the one hand, and the claim of public interest on the other,\n\nand if &quot;public interest&quot; justifies disclosure, i.e., the public interest\n\noutweighs the need for protection of personal information, the\n\nconcerned authority shall disclose the information.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_41\">26.     For example, a querist may seek from the income tax\n\nauthorities- the details of the income tax returns filed by private\n\nindividual/juristic entity - if the querist can justify the disclosure of such\n\npersonal information on the anvil of public interest.          The authorities\n\nwould, in such cases, be cautious to ensure that the ground of &quot;public\n\ninterest&quot; is not routinely used as a garb by busy bodies to pry on the\n\npersonal affairs of individual private citizens/entities, as it would be\n\nagainst public interest (and not in public interest) to permit such\n\npersonal information of third parties to fall into the hands of anybody\n\nor everybody.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_42\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_43\">27.     At this stage, I may digress a little and observe that whenever\n\nthe querist applicant wishes to seek information, the disclosure of\n\nwhich     can    be      made   only   upon   existence   of   certain   special\n\ncircumstances, for example- the existence of public interest, the\n\nquerist should in the application (moved under <a href=\"/doc/1910806/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 6</a> of the Act)\n\ndisclose/ plead the special circumstance, so that the PIO concerned\n\ncan apply his mind to it, and, in case he decides to issue notice to the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">W.P.

Only then the PIO/appellate\n\nauthority/CIC would be able to come to an informed decision whether,\n\nor not, the special circumstances exist in a given case.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_44\">28.    I may also observe that public interest does not mean that which\n\nis interesting as gratifying curiosity or love of information or\n\namusement; but that in which a class of the community have a\n\npecuniary interest, or some interest by which their rights or liabilities\n\nare affected. The expression &quot;public interest&quot; is not capable of a\n\nprecise definition and has not a rigid meaning and is elastic and takes\n\nits colors from the statute in which it occurs, the concept varying with\n\nthe time and the state of the society and its needs.

The second part of clause (j) of <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_43\">Section 8(1)</a> appears to deal with\n\nthe scope of defence founded on the right of privacy of an individual.\n\nThe tussle between the right of privacy of an individual and the right of\n\nothers to seek information which may impinge on the said right of\n\nprivacy, is what the said clause seeks to address.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_47\">30.    The right to privacy means the right to be left alone and the right\n\nof a person to be free from unwarranted publicity. Black‟s Law\n\nDictionary says that the terms „right to privacy‟ is a generic term\n\nencompassing various rights recognized to be inherent in concept of\n\nordered liberty, and such rights prevent government interference in\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">W.P.

It\n       therefore relates to and overlaps with the concept\n       of liberty. The most serious advocate of privacy\n       must confess that there are serious problems of\n       defining the essence and scope of the right. Privacy\n       interest in autonomy must also be placed in the\n       context of other rights and values.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">       Any right to privacy must encompass and protect\n       the personal intimacies of the home, the family,\n       marriage, motherhood, procreation and child\n       rearing. This catalogue approach to the question is\n       obviously not as instructive as it does not give\n       analytical picture of the distinctive characterstics of\n       the right of privacy. Perhaps, the only suggestion\n       that can be offered as unifying principle underlying\n       the concept has been the assertion that a claimed\n       right must be a fundamental right implicit in the\n       concept of ordered liberty....\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">       There are two possible theories for protecting\n       privacy of home. The first is that activities in the\n       home harm others only to the extent that they\n       cause offence resulting from the mere thought that\n       individuals might be engaging in such activities and\n       that such &#x27;harm&#x27; is not constitutionally protectible\n       by the State. The second is that individuals need a\n       place of sanctuary where they can be free from\n       societal control.

This is for the reason that\n       once a matter becomes a matter of public record, the right\n       to privacy no longer subsists and it becomes a legitimate\n       subject for comment by press and media among others.\n       We are, however, of the opinion that in the interest\n       of decency [<a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_51\">Article 19 (2)]</a> an exception must be\n       carved out to this rule, viz., a female who is the\n       victim of a sexual assault, kidnap, abduction or a\n       like offence should not further be subjected to the\n       indignity of her name and the incident being\n       publicised in press/media.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_56\">       (3) There is yet another exception to the Rule in (1) above -\n       indeed, this is not an exception but an independent rule. In\n       the case of public officials, it is obvious, right to\n       privacy, or for that matter, the remedy of action for\n       damages is simply not available with respect to\n       their acts and conduct relevant to the discharge of\n       their official duties. This is so even where the\n       publication is based upon facts and statements which are\n       not true, unless the official establishes that the publication\n       was made (by the defendant) with reckless disregard for\n       truth. In such a case, it would be enough for the defendant\n       (member of the press or media) to prove that he acted\n       after a reasonable verification of the facts; it is not\n       necessary for him to prove that what he has written is true.\n       Of course, where the publication is proved to be false and\n       actuated by malice or personal animosity, the defendant\n       would have no defence and would be liable for damages. It\n       is equally obvious that in matters not relevant to\n       the discharge of his duties, the public official enjoys\n       the same protection as any other citizen, as\n       explained in (1) and (2) above. It needs no reiteration\n       that judiciary, which is protected by the power to punish\n       for contempt of court and the Parliament and Legislatures\n       protected as their privileges are by <a href=\"/doc/1251904/\" id=\"a_52\">Articles 105</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1085458/\" id=\"a_53\">104</a>\n       respectively of the Constitution of India, represent\n       exceptions to this rule.&quot; (Emphasis supplied)\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">W.P.

It follows that the „privacy‟ of a person, or in other words his\n\n„private information‟, encompasses the personal intimacies of the\n\nhome, the family, marriage, motherhood, procreation, child rearing and\n\nof the like nature. „Personal information‟, on the other hand, as\n\naforesaid, would be information, in any form, that pertains to an\n\nindividual. Therefore, „private information‟ is a part of „personal\n\ninformation‟. All that is private is personal, but all that is personal may\n\nnot be private. A person has a right to keep his private information, or\n\nin other words, his privacy guarded from disclosure. It is this right\n\nwhich has come to be recognised as fundamental to a person‟s life and\n\nliberty, and is accordingly protected from unwarranted/unauthorised\n\ninvasion under the Act, and can be overridden only in „larger‟ public\n\ninterest.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_58\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_59\">35.    The use of the expression &quot;unwarranted&quot; before &quot;invasion of the\n\nprivacy of the individual&quot; and the expression &quot;larger&quot; before &quot;public\n\ninterest&quot; needs attention.

He should, therefore,\n\ncome to the conclusion that even after application of the principle of\n\nseverability (contained in <a href=\"/doc/580445/\" id=\"a_54\">Section 10</a> of the Act), it is necessary to\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">W.P.

Therefore, if the information has a bearing on the\n\nstate    of   the   economy;      the   moral   values   in   the   society;   the\n\nenvironment; national safety, or the like, the same would qualify as\n\n&quot;larger public interest&quot;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_60\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_61\">36.

Even otherwise, its act of tendering advice to the\n\nconcerned Ministry on matters relating to disciplinary proceedings\n\nagainst a charged officer is in discharge of a public duty entrusted to it\n\nby the law itself, and is thereby a public activity.

Information is currency that every citizen requires to\n       participate in the life and governance of the society. In any\n       democratic polity, greater the access, greater will be the\n       responsiveness, and greater the restrictions, greater the\n       feeling of powerlessness and alienation. Information is\n       basis for knowledge, which provokes thought, and without\n       thinking process, there is no expression. &quot;Knowledge&quot; said\n       James Madison, &quot;will forever govern ignorance and a\n       people who mean to be their own governors must arm\n       themselves with the power knowledge gives. A popular\n       government without popular information or the means of\n       obtaining it is but a prologue to farce or tragedy or perhaps\n       both&quot;. The citizens‟ right to know the facts, the true\n       facts, about the administration of the country is\n       thus one of the pillars of a democratic State. And that\n       is why the demand for openness in the government is\n       increasingly growing in different parts of the world. &quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_77\">       (emphasis supplied)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_78\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"112850760\" id=\"span_33\">43.    The Court, while explaining the importance and need of the\n\nRight, referred to the following observation of the Supreme Court in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/112850760/\" id=\"a_60\">S.P. Gupta vs. Union of India</a>, 1981 (Supp) SCC 87:</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_79\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">W.P. (C) No. 1243/2011                                         Page 23 of 32</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">        &quot;65. The demand for openness in the government is based\n       principally on two reasons. It is now widely accepted that\n       democracy does not consist merely in people exercising\n       their franchise once in five years to choose their rules and,\n       once the vote is cast, then retiring in passivity and not\n       taking any interest in the government. Today it is common\n       ground that democracy has a more positive content and its\n       orchestration has to be continuous and pervasive. This\n       means inter alia that people should not only cast intelligent\n       and rational votes but should also exercise sound\n       judgment on the conduct of the government and the merits\n       of public policies, so that democracy does not remain\n       merely a sporadic exercise in voting but becomes a\n       continuous process of government - an attitude and habit\n       of mind. But this important role people can fulfill in a\n       democracy only if it is an open government where\n       there is full access to information in regard to the\n       functioning of the government.&quot; (emphasis supplied)\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_80\">44.    After, having referred to a sea of judgments and scholarly\n\nexcerpts, the Division Bench of this Court held as follows:\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">       &quot;60. The decisions cited by the learned Attorney General\n       on the meaning of the words &quot;held&quot; or &quot;control&quot; are\n       relating to property and cannot be relied upon in\n       interpretation of the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_61\">Right to Information\n       Act</a>. The source of right to information does not\n       emanate from the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_62\">Right to Information Act</a>. It is a\n       right    that    emerges      from    the    constitutional\n       guarantees under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_63\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> as held by the\n       Supreme Court in a catena of decisions. <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_64\">The Right to\n       Information Act</a> is not repository of the right to\n       information. Its repository is the constitutional\n       rights guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_65\">Article 19(</a>(1)(a). <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_66\">The Act</a> is\n       merely an instrument that lays down statutory\n       procedure in the exercise of this right. Its\n       overreaching purpose is to facilitate democracy by\n       helping to ensure that citizens have the information\n       required     to    participate    meaningfully      in  the\n       democratic process and to help the governors\n       accountable to the governed. In construing such a\n       statute the Court ought to give to it the widest\n       operation which its language will permit. The Court\n       will also not readily read words which are not there\n       and introduction of which will restrict the rights of\n       citizens for whose benefit the statute is intended.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_81\">       (Emphasis supplied)\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">W.P.

It is clear from the above, that the thrust of the legislation is to\n\nsecure access to information under the control of public authorities in\n\norder to promote transparency and accountability in the working of\n\nevery public authority, unless its disclosure is exempted under the Act.\n\nThe access to information is considered vital to the functioning of a\n\ndemocracy, as it creates an informed citizenry. Transparency of\n\ninformation is considered vital to contain corruption and to hold\n\nGovernment and its instrumentalities accountable to the governed\n\ncitizens of this country.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_83\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_84\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"182742167\" id=\"span_36\">46.

The CIC held that\n\nthe file notings relating to vigilance matters, on the basis of which\n\nadministrative/disciplinary   action   has   been   taken   may   not   be\n\ndisclosed, except upon demonstration of public interest, as it could\n\nembarrass and put pressure on those making file notings regarding the\n\nofficer whose conduct is under comment.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_86\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_87\">48.    The concerns expressed in, and which swayed the decision of the\n\nCIC in Shri K.L.

However, those concerns\n\ncannot be a good reason to altogether deny information which,\n\notherwise, is not exempt from disclosure under the law. Consequently,\n\nthe defence set up by the petitioner, founded upon clause (j) of <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_71\">Section\n\n8(1)</a> is not tenable in this case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_88\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_89\">49.

The    Supreme         Court    in    <a href=\"/doc/1355531/\" id=\"a_83\">Khanapuram               Gandaiah        vs.\n\nAdministrative Officer</a>, (2010) 2 SCC 1, while referring to <a href=\"/doc/277989/\" id=\"a_84\">Section 2</a></span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_98\">(f) of the Act, which defines „information‟, held as under:\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">       &quot;10. x            x    x       x       x         x          x     x       x\n\n       This definition shows that an applicant under <a href=\"/doc/1910806/\" id=\"a_85\">Section 6</a> of\n       the RTI Act can get any information which is already in\n       existence and accessible to the public authority under law.\n       Of course, under the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_86\">RTI Act</a> an applicant is entitled\n       to get copy of the opinions, advices, circulars,\n       orders, etc., but he cannot ask for any information as to\n       why such opinions, advices, circulars, orders, etc. have\n       been passed, especially in matters pertaining to judicial\n       decisions.&quot; (emphasis supplied)\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_99\">55.    Therefore,        what       emerges        from          the   aforesaid       is   that\n\nopinions/advices tendered/given by the officers (public officials) can be\n\nsought for under the Act, provided the same have not been tendered in\n\nconfidence/secrecy and in trust to the authority concerned, i.e. to say-\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">W.P.

Since the petitioner has not been able to\n\nset up the same in the present case, as aforesaid, the claim of\n\nexemption under <a href=\"/doc/1494553/\" id=\"a_87\">Section 8(1)(e)</a> stands rejected.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_100\">56.    A bare perusal of <a href=\"/doc/1535548/\" id=\"a_88\">Section 8(1)(g)</a> of the Act, makes it clear that\n\nthe exemption would come into operation only if the disclosure of\n\ninformation would endanger the life or physical safety of any person or\n\nwould identify the source of the information or assistance given in\n\nconfidence       for     law   enforcement       or   security    purposes.     The\n\nopinion/advice, which constitutes the information in the present case,\n\ncannot be said to have been given &quot;in confidence for law\n\nenforcement or security purposes&quot;, as aforesaid. Therefore, that part\n\nof the clause would be inapplicable and irrelevant in the present case.\n\nSo far as the petitioner‟s submission- that the disclosure of Information\n\nwould endanger the life and safety of the officers who tendered their\n\nopinion/advices- is concerned, the same in my considered opinion, as\n\naforesaid, in the facts of the present case, may be addressed- by resort\n\nto <a href=\"/doc/580445/\" id=\"a_89\">Section 10</a> of the Act. The exemption under <a href=\"/doc/1535548/\" id=\"a_90\">Section 8(1)(g)</a> of the\n\nAct, therefore, as claimed by the Petitioner, would be no ground for\n\ndisallowing     the      disclosure   of   the   information     (sought   by   the\n\nRespondent) in the facts of the present case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_101\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_102\">57.    At this stage, I may take note of the fact that the petitioner\n\nherein tendered to this court, after the judgment in the present case\n\nhad been reserved, decisions of the CIC- wherein information sought\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">W.P. (C) No. 1243/2011                                                 Page 30 of 32</span>\n by RTI applicants with regard to disciplinary proceedings of charged\n\nofficers, were held to be exempt from disclosure under <a href=\"/doc/1788374/\" id=\"a_91\">Section 8(1)(h)</a>\n\nof     the      Act      on   the   grounds    that   the    disciplinary\n\nproceedings/investigation were ongoing, and as such, disclosure of\n\ninformation sought would impede the process of investigation.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_103\">58.    The said argument cannot be availed of by the petitioner herein\n\nas it was not raised at any stage (before and after the filing of the\n\npresent petition), and no opportunity was afforded to the respondent\n\nherein to meet the same.        Moreover, on the facts of this case, the\n\nargument premised upon clause (h) of <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_92\">Section 8(1)</a> cannot be\n\nsustained. The information sought at point „B‟ relates to the note\n\nsheets and final opinion rendered by the UPSC regarding imposition of\n\npenalty/punishment on the charged offer. Such information, as is\n\nevident from a plain reading, relates to notings and opinion post\n\ninvestigation i.e., after the investigation is complete.    Disclosure of\n\nsuch information cannot, be any means whatsoever be held to\n\n&quot;impede the process of investigation&quot; which could be raised only when\n\nan investigation is ongoing. As such the exemption under <a href=\"/doc/1788374/\" id=\"a_93\">Section\n\n8(1)(h)</a> of the Act also cannot be raised in by the petitioner in the\n\npresent case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_104\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_105\">59.    The petitioner‟s submission that the order of the CIC is\n\nunsustainable in as much as it is contrary to the decisions of the\n\nconcurrent benches of the CIC is neither here nor there. The impugned\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">W.P.

As regards the Petitioner‟s\n\nsubmission that the CIC‟s decision (Impugned order) is unsustainable\n\nsince it was rendered while this Court was seized of a similar issue in\n\nUPSC v. C.L. Sharma (supra)- is concerned, the same in my view is\n\nentirely untenable. The pendency of the same issue in other cases\n\nbefore this Court does not preclude the CIC from dealing with the\n\nissues arising before it, unless there is a restraint on the CIC from\n\ndoing so.     There is nothing on record to suggest that this Court has, in\n\nUPSC v. C.L. Sharma (supra), put a blanket restraint on the CIC from\n\ndealing with the claim of exemption under <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_94\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the Act.\n\nTherefore, the said submission also stands rejected.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_106\">60.    In view of above, the decision of the CIC is upheld, subject to the\n\nmodification that the petitioner may, examine the case with regard to\n\napplicability of <a href=\"/doc/580445/\" id=\"a_95\">Section 10</a> of the Act, in relation to the names of the\n\nofficers who may have acted in the process of opinion formation while\n\ndealing with the case of charged officer Sh.G.S. Narang.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_107\">61.    The petition is accordingly disposed of.
