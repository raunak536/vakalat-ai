In the said SLP, the respondent no.1 sought ad interim ex\n\nparte stay of the operation of the orders of this Court.

The respondent\n\nno.1 however did not appear and on the contrary, filed I.A. No. 10394/2011\n\n(supra) against order whereon the present appeal is preferred.

The\n\nlearned Single Judge before whom the suit was now pending has vide\n\norder/judgment dated 23rd September, 2011 impugned in this appeal held the\n\nrefusal of the respondent no.1 to submit the blood sample to be wilful, mala\n\nfide, unreasonable and unjustified. However after holding so, it has been\n\nheld that the respondent no.1 cannot be physically compelled or be\n\nphysically confined for submitting a blood sample for DNA profiling, in\n\nimplementation of the order/judgment dated 23rd December, 2010.

In our view, to say, that the exercise earlier undertaken by the Court,\n\nwas an empty one and in futility − that though the Court could issue a\n\ndirection for DNA testing but not implement or enforce the same, has the\n\ntendency of making the law and the Court, a laughing stock. The perception\n\nof &quot;the law&quot; as Mr. Bumble (in Oliver Twist) said &quot;is a ass - a idiot&quot; will be\n\ncemented, if the Courts themselves hold their own orders to be\n\nun-implementable and un-enforceable. It is the duty of every Court to\n\nprevent its machinery from being made a sham, thereby running down the\n\nRule of Law and rendering itself an object of public ridicule.

The Courts have always attempted against rendering the orders and\n\ndecrees of the Court to be merely good on paper and otherwise ineffective to\n\nsettle the rights of the parties.

The Courts cannot hold a decree or order passed\n\nafter long deliberations as in the present case also, to be merely paper\n\ndecree/order incapable of deciding in fact what it was intended to decide or\n\nincapable of changing the position which it intended to change.

What also surprises us is that the order of injunction aforesaid, has\n\nbeen held by the learned Single Judge to be un-implementable and un-\n\nenforceable for the reason of implementation thereof being fraught with\n\nphysical coercion and intrusion on the rights of the respondent no.1 under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_20\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution and being not envisaged in any statutory\n\nprovision governing civil litigation. However, the impugned order itself, as\n\nalso the earlier order dated 23rd December, 2010 holds, a direction for such\n\nDNA testing to be not violative of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_21\">Article 21.</a> The Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/338008/\" id=\"a_22\">Selvi v.\n\nState of Karnataka</a> (2010) 7 SCC 263 upheld the authority of Civil Court to\n\norder a medical examination in exercise of the inherent powers vested in it\n\nby <a href=\"/doc/56600062/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 151</a> of the CPC, though held that the same reasoning cannot be\n\napplied in the criminal context (para 175). Rather (in para 203) it was held\n\nthat compelled extraction of blood samples in the course of a medical\n\nexamination does not amount to &quot;conduct that shocks the conscience&quot; and\n\nthat &quot;use of force as may be reasonably necessary is mandated by law and\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">FAO(OS) No. 547/2011                                                 Page 15 of 31</span>\n hence it meets the threshold of procedure established by law&quot;. The learned\n\nSingle Judge has in paras 74, 78, 79 and 80 of the impugned judgment also\n\nheld that the right of privacy is subject to such action as may be lawfully\n\ntaken for protection of rights of others; that the level of privacy protection\n\ndepends on the context; that Human Rights law justifies carrying out of\n\ncompulsory and mandatory medical examination which may be bodily\n\ninvasive and that the right to privacy is not an absolute right and can be\n\nreasonably curtailed. The learned Single Judge having held so, we are\n\nunable to fathom as to how the same factors could be an impediment to the\n\nenforceability and implementability of the order.

I need not dilate upon this, for I recognise that it is\n             impossible to say that there is no stigma of bastardy even though\n             it be no more than the indirect stigma of the imputation of\n             unchastity to the mother of the child so described. On the other\n             hand, it is difficult to conceive of cases where, assuming\n             illegitimacy in fact, it is to the advantage of the child that this\n             legal status of legitimacy should be preserved only perhaps to be\n             displaced by firm evidence of illegitimacy decided later in his or\n             her life from a blood test.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">             The interests of justice in the abstract are best served by the\n             ascertainment of the truth and their must be few cases where the\n             interests of children can be shown to be best served by the\n             suppression of truth.

Of even greater\n             importance is the abandonment of the legal concept of\n             legitimacy achieved by the Family Law Act 1987.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_35\">It was further observed that paternity of any child is to be established by\n\nscience and not by legal presumption or inference or by a long and\n\nacrimonious trial.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_36\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"728395\" id=\"span_37\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"976494\" id=\"span_38\">27.

Seen in the aforesaid light it will be found that the opposition by the\n\nrespondent no.1 to DNA testing was considered and decided when the\n\napplication of the appellant for the said relief was considered. The\n\napplication (I.A. No. 10394/2011) moved by the respondent no.1 and which\n\nhas been allowed was thus by way of re-agitating the same issues and ought\n\nnot to have been entertained much less allowed.

Once such rights\n\nhad been adjudicated by the Suit Court and the appeal thereagainst had been\n\ndismissed and the application for stay having been rejected by the Apex\n\nCourt, it was not open to the Suit Court to again entertain the said question.\n\nIf such practices were to be permitted, it will have dangerous consequences.\n\nIt is rarely that entire suit is decided by the same Judge. If it were to be\n\npermissible for each successive Judge presiding over a Court to take a\n\ndifferent view, it will not only lead to the litigants and the counsels urging\n\nthe same issues repeatedly each time on change of Roster but also be\n\ncontrary to Rule of Law.

We may highlight that as per the dicta of the Supreme Court noticed\n\nby the learned Single Judge also, a direction for DNA testing can be issued\n\nonly after the test of eminent need is satisfied. The order dated 23 rd\n\nDecember, 2010 directed DNA testing of the respondent no.1 only after\n\nholding the said test to be satisfied in the facts of the present case. The\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_60\">FAO(OS) No. 547/2011                                                Page 28 of 31</span>\n impugned judgment though also holding that the test of eminent need is\n\nsatisfied has declined to enforce the order. It is thus not as if the order for\n\nDNA testing is made or has been made in the present case on the asking or\n\nin a routine manner for the consequence only of adverse inference to flow\n\nfrom non-compliance thereof. We find inherent contradiction in the Court\n\non the one hand holding eminent need for such a test and in the same breath\n\nallowing the need to remain unsatiated. We also find the drawing of adverse\n\ninference from refusal to comply with the direction for medical examination\n\nto be not sufficient to satiate the need found by the Court. A legal fiction\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_60\">Section 114</a> of the Evidence Act, as adverse inference is, is not reality\n\nbut which the said provision requires the Court to accept as reality.
