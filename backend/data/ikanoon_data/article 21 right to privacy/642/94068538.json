We also directed the respondents to appoint\n\nthe applicants on the post of Constable as per their\n\nmerit, and subject to their being found suitable after\n\nmedical examination or any other criteria except the\n\none regarding juvenile acts.   We further directed that\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                          4</span>\n                                          OA No2.158/2019, 271/2019, 4333/2018\n\n\n\n\nthis exercise would be completed by the respondents\n\nwithin a period of eight weeks from the date of receipt\n\nof the said order.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_2\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_3\">     2.    The respondents, Government of National\n\nCapital Territory and others, approached the Hon&#x27;ble\n\nHigh Court of Delhi by filing three writ petitions, i.e.,\n\nWP(C) Nos.4004/2024, 4007/2024 and 4057/2024 [in\n\ncases of Vikash (OA No.158/2019); Kuldeep (OA\n\nNo.271/2019); and Hanuman Singh Sekhawat (OA\n\nNo.4333/2018)], respectively. These writ petitions were\n\ndisposed of by the Division Bench of the Hon&#x27;ble High\n\nCourt vide a common order dated 18.03.2024.                         The\n\nDivision Bench observed that the Tribunal had failed to\n\nconsider the effect of the Standing Order, which laid\n\ndown parameters for determining the suitability of\n\ncandidates for appointment in Delhi Police.                          The\n\nDivision Bench also agreed with the finding of the\n\nTribunal that the respondents could not prescribe such\n\ncriteria which are contrary to the spirit of the <a href=\"/doc/9677640/\" id=\"a_1\">Juvenile\n\nJustice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015</a>\n\n(hereinafter referred as the 2015 Act), as also various\n\ndecisions of the High Court and the Apex Court. The\n\nDivision Bench, however, further held that the SO\n\nbased on which the respondents had considered\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                          5</span>\n                                          OA No2.158/2019, 271/2019, 4333/2018\n\n\n\n\nsuitability of the applicants for appointment, had not\n\nbeen examined or quashed by the Tribunal. In the light\n\nof these observations, the Division Bench was of the\n\nview that the Tribunal ought to have examined the\n\nvalidity of the Standing Order which prima facie\n\nappears to be contrary to the provisions of the aforesaid\n\nAct, and, therefore, set aside the above referred order of\n\nthe Tribunal and remanded the three OAs back to the\n\nTribunal for determining the validity of the Standing\n\nOrder, which was the very basis of the respondents&#x27;\n\naction.    The Division Bench also permitted the\n\napplicants to file amended OAs specifically assailing the\n\nsaid Standing Order.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_5\">      3.   In terms of the above referred decision of the\n\nHon&#x27;ble High Court of Delhi, the applicants filed\n\namended OAs challenging the validity of the said\n\nStanding Order. The respondents have not filed their\n\ncounter reply to the amended OAs, and made a\n\nstatement that the counter reply filed in the earlier\n\nround of litigation may be read as counter in the\n\namended OAs.       We accordingly heard the learned\n\ncounsel for respective parties.   We have also perused\n\nthe pleadings of parties and the case law cited before\n\nus.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                            6</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_6\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_7\">                                               OA No2.158/2019, 271/2019, 4333/2018\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">     4.

However, since\n\ncommon questions of law and facts are involved in all\n\nthe three OAs, we propose to dispose of these OAs by\n\nthe present common order.

The stand taken by learned\n\ncounsel for the applicant is that the applicant cannot be\n\ndenied appointment to the post of Constable in Delhi Police\n\nsolely on the ground of his being unsuitable, in view of the\n\nfollowing reasons:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">          i)     That the applicant was under no obligation\n\n                 to disclose his involvement in any criminal\n\n                 case pertaining to a period when he was a\n\n                 juvenile;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">          ii)    In terms of Section 19 of The Juvenile Act,\n\n                 2000 and 2015, the applicant cannot be\n\n                 denied        the        benefit        of          government\n\n                 employment because of any FIR emanating\n\n                 from any criminal act committed while he\n\n                 was a juvenile;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">          iii)   Learned counsel for the applicant has given\n\n                 a    series   of     citations     in    his          favour               as\n\n                 mentioned in para 8.2 of this order.

Thus, the respondents have\n\n                never disqualified the applicant solely on the\n\n                basis of his past criminal record, however,\n\n                the Standing Order No.398 ibid, authorises\n\n                them to thoroughly examine the criminal\n\n                details of a prospective appointee like the\n\n                applicant and then arrive at a conclusion\n\n                regarding his suitability or otherwise for the\n\n                post of Constable. In terms of the said\n\n                Standing Order, the Screening Committee\n\n                had applied its mind and recorded the\n\n                reasons     for     applicant&#x27;s     unsuitability.\n\n                Moreover, the said Standing Order of Delhi\n\n                Police has never been questioned or struck\n\n                down by any court of law even till date.\n\n                Hence, the respondents were well within\n\n                their right to reject the applicant&#x27;s claim on\n\n                the basis of unsuitability as opposed to\n\n                disqualification,    as   mentioned              in         The\n\n                Juvenile Act, 2000 and 2015.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_84\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_85\">     13.

Undoubtedly, on the date, when the offence was\n               said to have been committed by the petitioner, he was\n               a &quot;juvenile&quot;, as defined under the <a href=\"/doc/9677640/\" id=\"a_30\">Juvenile Justice\n               (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015</a> [in short\n               &quot;the 2015 <a href=\"/doc/148942/\" id=\"a_31\">JJ Act</a>&quot;]. <a href=\"/doc/196764183/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 3(xiv)</a> of the 2015 <a href=\"/doc/148942/\" id=\"a_33\">JJ Act</a>\n               mandates [as one of the guiding principles] that a\n               fresh start should be afforded to a child, who passes\n               through the juvenile justice system by erasing all past\n               records,    save    and     except,   where    special\n               circumstances demand otherwise.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">               <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"51928266\" id=\"span_34\">5.3. This aspect was emphasized by the Supreme\n               Court in a judgment rendered in <a href=\"/doc/51928266/\" id=\"a_34\">Union of India and\n               others versus Ramesh Bishnoi</a> (2019) 19 SCC 710,\n               where the appointment of the concerned persons, i.e.,\n               one Ramesh Bishnoi was cancelled on the ground\n               that a criminal case had been lodged against him\n               under the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/203036/\" id=\"a_35\">Sections 354</a>, <a href=\"/doc/162506/\" id=\"a_36\">447</a> and <a href=\"/doc/68146/\" id=\"a_37\">509</a> of\n               the IPC. In this case as well, at the time when the\n               alleged offence was committed, Ramesh Bishnoi was\n               well below eighteen years of age.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">               5.3(a). In the trial that ensued, Ramesh Bishnoi was\n               acquitted. The Supreme Court, while noting that the\n               offence could not be proved as neither the girl against\n               whom the alleged offence had been committed nor her\n               parents stepped into the witness box, which resulted\n               in acquittal of Ramesh Bishnoi, made the following\n               observations, having regard to the principle of fresh\n               start engrafted in <a href=\"/doc/1444749/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 3(xiv)</a> of the 2015 <a href=\"/doc/148942/\" id=\"a_39\">JJ Act</a>:\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">           27</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">                              OA No2.158/2019, 271/2019, 4333/2018\n\n\n\n\n&quot;8. From the facts, it is clear that at the time\nwhen the charges were framed against the\nrespondent, on 30-6-2009, the respondent was\nwell under the age of 18 years as his date of\nbirth is 5-9-1991. Firstly, it was not disputed\nthat the charges were never proved against the\nrespondent as the girl and her parents did not\ndepose against the respondent, resulting in his\nacquittal on 24-11-2011. Even if the allegations\nwere found to be true, then too, the respondent\ncould not have been deprived of getting a job on\nthe basis of such charges as the same had\nbeen committed while the respondent was\njuvenile. The thrust of the legislation i.e.\nthe <a href=\"/doc/148942/\" id=\"a_40\">Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection\nof Children) Act, 2000</a> as well as the\n<a href=\"/doc/9677640/\" id=\"a_41\">Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of\nChildren) Act, 2015</a> is that even if a\njuvenile is convicted, the same should be\nobliterated, so that there is no stigma with\nregard to any crime committed by such\nperson as a juvenile. This is with the clear\nobject to reintegrate such juvenile back in\nthe society as a normal person, without\nany stigma. <a href=\"/doc/46197151/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 3</a> of the Juvenile\nJustice (Care and Protection of Children)\nAct, 2015 lays down guidelines for the\nCentral Government, State Governments,\nthe Board and other agencies while\nimplementing the provisions of the said\nAct. In clause (xiv) of <a href=\"/doc/1444749/\" id=\"a_43\">Section 3</a>, it is clearly\nprovided as follows:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">&quot;3. (xiv) Principle of fresh start: All past\nrecords of any child under the juvenile justice\nsystem should be erased except in special\ncircumstances.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_91\">9. In the present case, it is an admitted\nfact that the respondent was a minor\nwhen the charges had been framed\nagainst him of the offences under <a href=\"/doc/203036/\" id=\"a_44\">Sections\n354</a>, <a href=\"/doc/162506/\" id=\"a_45\">447</a> and <a href=\"/doc/68146/\" id=\"a_46\">509</a> IPC. It is also not\ndisputed that he was acquitted of the\ncharges. However, even if he had been\nconvicted, the same could not have been\nheld against him for getting a job, as\nadmittedly, he was a minor when the\nalleged offences were committed and the\ncharges had been framed against him.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_92\"><a href=\"/doc/1444749/\" id=\"a_47\">Section 3(xiv)</a> provides for the same and\nthe exception of special circumstances\ndoes not apply to the facts of the present\ncase.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_93\">10. Further, the case against the\nrespondent is not with regard to the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">                                28</span>\n                                                OA No2.158/2019, 271/2019, 4333/2018\n\n\n\n\n                     suppression of any conviction or charges\n                     having been framed against him. The\n                     respondent had very fairly disclosed about\n                     the charges which had been framed and\n                     his acquittal on the basis of no evidence\n                     having been adduced by the complainant\n                     against the respondent. In our considered\n                     view, the same can also not be said to be a\n                     suppression by the respondent, on the\n                     basis of which he could be deprived of a\n                     job, for which he was duly selected after\n                     following     the  due     process     and\n                     appointment having been offered to him.&quot;\n                     [emphasis is ours]\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_94\">     17.

However, we do not subscribe the view expressed\n\nby learned counsel for the applicant that the applicant is\n\nfrom a rural background and that the post for which he has\n\nbeen provisionally selected is at the lowest rung of the\n\nhierarchy in Delhi Police. The suitability of a person is to be\n\nadjudged for the post for which he has been selected and the\n\ncandidate has to fulfill the requirement of the job irrespective\n\nof his hailing from rural or urban background. Moreover, the\n\npost of Constable may be at the lowest rung of the hierarchy\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">                               29</span>\n                                                OA No2.158/2019, 271/2019, 4333/2018\n\n\n\n\nbut it is the first and direct interface of the police with the\n\ngeneral public and is of critical importance for the reporting\n\nand investigation of criminal matters.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_96\">     19. Be that as it may, we find that irrespective of the\n\nfact whether the applicant had disclosed the FIRs/conviction\n\nwhile he was a juvenile, he is certainly entitled to all the\n\nprotection and benefits enshrined under <a href=\"/doc/49588121/\" id=\"a_49\">The Juvenile Act</a>.\n\nHis claim gets further strengthened by judicial verdicts of\n\nthe Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court discussed above.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_97\">     20. In view of the above, the respondents did not have\n\nthe leverage to cancel the applicant&#x27;s candidature on his\n\nbeing   found   unsuitable   by    the   Screening     Committee.\n\nAlthough learned counsel for the respondents vehemently\n\nargued that the Standing Order of Delhi Police mentioned\n\nabove has never been questioned or quashed/struck down\n\nby any court of law, yet we feel that rejection of the\n\napplicant&#x27;s claim in the garb of his unsuitability adjudged by\n\nthe Screening Committee on the basis of his past criminal\n\nrecord when he was a juvenile, would be against the spirit of\n\nThe Juvenile Act, 2000 and 2015.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_98\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_99\">     21.
