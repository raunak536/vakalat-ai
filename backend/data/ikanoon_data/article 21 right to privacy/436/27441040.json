(Ms) No.42/93/PW&amp;T dated 19.05.1993 was passed,\n\nthrough which it was directed that KIAS (the predecessor of CIAL)\n\nmust be constituted. An interesting feature of this GOM dated\n\n19.05.1993 is that KIAS was to be constituted of Government\n\nnominees and Government officers in majority, having a\n                                                      2025:KER:57823\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                  40</span>\nW.A No.45 of 2023 &amp; conn. cases\n\n\n\npredominant say in the decision-making and administration of\n\nassets of KIAS. Apropos, the Chief Minister of Kerala and the State\n\nMinister for Transport were nominated as the Chairman and\n\nVice-Chairman of KIAS, respectively. Shri V.J Kurian, District\n\nCollector was nominated as the Special Coordinating Officer for\n\nimplementing the whole project. Shri.V.J Kurian is considered to be\n\nthe moving brain and the implementer of the whole vision and\n\ndream of Cochin International Airport, what it stands today. This\n\nis luminescent from the fact that the official booklet/ brochure of\n\nCIAL titled as &#x27;Insignia of a Dream&#x27; has dedicated not only a chapter\n\nspecifically acknowledging the contribution of Shri.V.J Kurian, but\n\nalso abundantly mentioned his role as the facilitator, executor and\n                                                        2025:KER:57823\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                  41</span>\nW.A No.45 of 2023 &amp; conn. cases\n\n\n\nthe actual brain behind the conception of the whole idea of Cochin\n\nInternational Airport.

However, it must be mentioned that the said idea failed to\n\ntake off as there was a lukewarm response from the prospective\n\ninvestors for various reasons, one of them being the very\n\nuncertainty of the airport in being established finally. At this stage,\n                                                     2025:KER:57823\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                   42</span>\nW.A No.45 of 2023 &amp; conn. cases\n\n\n\nagain the Government of Kerala (for short, &#x27;GOK&#x27;) was approached\n\nby the private citizens, association of industrialists and\n\nbusinessmen, which under the chairmanship of the erstwhile Chief\n\nMinister proposed the incorporation of a company in the name and\n\nstyle of CIAL. The entire asset structure, including the land base,\n\ncapital and funds of KIAS were then transferred to CIAL on its\n\nincorporation.

However, the participation of the\n\nState Government stood only at 26% at this stage and not 51% with\n\nthe financial aid of around Rs.19 crores.

If its functioning is independent of the\n\n             finances of the government, there can be no manner of\n\n             doubt that it is not &#x27;substantially financed&#x27;;\n\n      h.​    In support of the contention that CIAL is not &#x27;substantially\n\n             financed&#x27; by GOK or its subsidiary or its instrumentalities,\n                                                         2025:KER:57823\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">                                   58</span>\nW.A No.45 of 2023 &amp; conn. cases\n\n\n             detailed reference has been made to facts and figures of\n\n             total asset value and investment of CIAL, vis-a-vis the\n\n             investments made by GOK or share capital held by GOK,\n\n             which comes to a pittance when compared to the former.

Referring to\n\nthe certificate of incorporation dated March 1994, it is further\n\ncontended that registration of a company along with its\n\nindependent MoA and AoA can not be presumed to be clothed as a\n\n&#x27;public authority&#x27;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_61\">      35.​ The aforementioned contention is quoted to be rejected\n\nfor the fundamental reason that CIAL as a company was not\n\nincorporated for the first time, nor can it be said that it had no\n\npredecessors. As explicated above, it&#x27;s an admitted fact that CIAL\n\nwas preceded by KIAS, which was a society predominantly\n\nconstitutive of senior functionaries of the GOK like the Chief\n                                                          2025:KER:57823\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\">                                        76</span>\nW.A No.45 of 2023 &amp; conn. cases\n\n\n\nMinister, the Cabinet Minister, as also of senior bureaucrats,\n\ndeputed and officiating in the State of Kerala, who had steered the\n\ndream of an international airport into fruition. One of them was\n\nerstwhile Collector of Ernakulam, Shri. V.J. Kurian, who had\n\npersonally taken up the whole fight for arranging resources for\n\ncommissioning and establishment of an international airport. KIAS\n\nwas clearly established through G.O. (Ms) No. 42/93/PW&amp;T dated\n\n19.05.1993 issued by the GOK to handle all the issues relating to\n\nland     acquisition       and    the   insurmountable   financial   and\n\nadministrative difficulties being faced regarding the same. Had\n\nKIAS not been constituted, perhaps the necessity for constitution\n\nof CIAL after the land base of KIAS had become substantial would\n                                                    2025:KER:57823\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_53\">                                  77</span>\nW.A No.45 of 2023 &amp; conn. cases\n\n\n\nhave never arisen. The constitution of CIAL led to transfer of the\n\nentire asset structure and land base being passed over under the\n\nname, title and ownership of CIAL overnight, which could have\n\nnever been possible without the government of the day agreeing\n\nand consenting for the same. KIAS can clearly be treated as a\n\npredecessor of CIAL, from whom CIAL borrowed all the assets, land\n\nbase and other capital and funds.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_62\">      36.​ Therefore in view of our foregoing analysis, it can\n\nclearly be held that CIAL&#x27;s predecessor came into existence by\n\nvirtue of an order issued by the GOK (through the erstwhile\n\nCollector, Ernakulam District). Had KIAS not been there, clearly\n\nthe question of constitution of CIAL would have never arisen and\n                                                     2025:KER:57823\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_54\">                                  78</span>\nW.A No.45 of 2023 &amp; conn. cases\n\n\n\ntherefore it can safely be recorded that KIAS and resultantly CIAL\n\nboth came into existence by virtue of a specific order, bearing G.O.\n\n(Ms) No. 42/93/PW&amp;T dated 19.05.1993 issued by the Collector in\n\nthis regard. It is this G.O. (Ms) No. 42/93/PW&amp;T dated 19.05.1993\n\nthat had set the stage formally for establishment and\n\ncommissioning of the airport at Cochin. Clearly, therefore the first\n\nlimb of <a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_69\">Sec. 2(h)(d)(i)</a> stands satisfied in the present case of CIAL\n\nbeing established by an order made by the appropriate\n\ngovernment.

It is to be noticed that excluding the debts at initiation\n\n             phase, the Government&#x27;s finance is at 30.8% and the private\n\n             promoters financing amounts to 17.1 % as indicated in the\n\n             statement of objections. The security to the lenders for the project\n\n             is also to be found in Clause 14.1.2 of the Concession Agreement.\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_89\">             The State Government has also ensured that uninterrupted supply\n\n             of power and water has to be given to the petitioners. If one were to\n\n             take these substantial concession in terms of indirect finance\n\n             which is given indirectly, it leads to the conclusion that the\n\n             petitioner is a non-Government body which is substantially\n\n             financed directly or indirectly by the funds provided by the\n\n             appropriate Government. The finance could be either as\n\n             investment or towards the expenses, or both. The way in which the\n\n             words have been placed, indicates that perhaps (i) relates to the\n\n             investments and (ii) relates to the running expenses. Thus every\n\n             institution which is owned by the Government or not is clearly\n\n             covered.

No words in an Act can be considered to be superfluous,\n\n             unless the contradiction is so much as to render a significant part\n\n             meaningless or they violate the preamble. Therefore, it becomes\n\n             necessary to consider a situation where an entity may be\n\n             controlled by Government without ownership or substantial\n\n             finance. The interpretation given by some that &#x27;control&#x27; means any\n\n             kind of control like that exercised by the Registrar of Societies over\n\n             Co-operative Societies, or by RBI on all private Banks is too wide\n\n             and certainly are not supported by the law. If we take this very\n\n             wide interpretation, all companies are controlled by the Registrar\n\n             of Companies, all sales tax dealers by the sales tax authorities and\n                                                                   2025:KER:57823\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_103\">                                       118</span>\nW.A No.45 of 2023 &amp; conn. cases\n\n\n             so on. By this logic, all companies, sales tax dealers amongst others\n\n             will have to give information under the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_122\">RTI Act</a>.

The company law gives\n\n             significant rights to those who own 26% of the shares in a\n\n             company. Perhaps this could be taken to define the criterion of\n\n             &#x27;substantial finance&#x27;. The finance could be as equity or subsidies in\n\n             land or concession in taxation.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">                    22.​   Thus, I am of the view that the twin conditions of the\n\n             <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_124\">RTI Act</a> are attracted, inasmuch as, the petitioner -- BIAL is\n\n             required to be construed as a &#x27;public authority&#x27; which is\n\n             substantially financed either directly or indirectly by the funds\n                                                               2025:KER:57823\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_104\">                                      119</span>\nW.A No.45 of 2023 &amp; conn. cases\n\n\n             provided by the appropriate Government.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">                    23.​   Indeed, another contention was raised by Learned\n\n             Counsel appearing for the petitioner that the State Commission\n\n             was not justified in importing the definition of &quot;substantially\n\n             financed&quot; from another enactment. He would contend that both\n\n             the CCAG as well as <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_125\">RTI Act</a> would operate in different fields.\n\n             Hence, they cannot be construed as pari materia.

In this regard, one will have to\n\n             fall back upon either the dictionary meaning of &quot;Substantially\n\n             Financed&quot; or for that matter, if the said phraseology is defined in\n\n             some other enactment, the same can be imported in this context.\n\n             <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1400139\" id=\"span_105\">In this regard, one can refer to the Division Bench ruling of this\n\n             Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1400139/\" id=\"a_127\">Bhavani Housing Co-Operative Society Limited\n\n             (R) v.
