Prior to approaching this Court, the petitioner filed an\n\napplication before the Trial Court seeking permission to terminate\n\nher pregnancy.

The petitioner has, therefore, approached this Court invoking\n\ninherent jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_1\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India\n\nby way of filing the present writ petition on 01.10.2019, in a bid to\n\nseek protection of right to privacy and right to live with dignity\n\nheld to be covered within the ambit of right to life and liberty\n\nembodied under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_2\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_13\">5.   On 04.10.2019, when the matter came up for motion\n\nhearing, this Court ordered to issue notices to the respondents and\n\ndirected Mr. Pankaj Sharma, learned Additional Advocate General\n\nto complete his instructions and furnish medical report (if any) of\n\nvictim &#x27;S&#x27; particularly regarding the age of the foetus and whether\n\ntermination of pregnancy is permissible, as per the provisions of\n\nthe <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_3\">Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971</a> (hereinafter\n\nreferred to as &quot;the Act&quot; or &quot;the <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_4\">MTP Act</a>&quot;).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">6.   On 15.10.2019, when the matter came up for consideration,\n\nlearned Additional Advocate General informed this Court that the\n\nfoetus is now about 25 weeks and as per the report, the petitioner\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                      (Downloaded on 18/10/2019 at 08:49:23 PM)</span>\n                                         (3 of 15)               [CW-14827/2019]\n\n\nis fit to carry the pregnancy and deliver the child safely. On such\n\ndate, during the course of proceedings, the Court required a\n\nmedical report to ascertain as to whether the termination of\n\npregnancy will be conducive to the health of &#x27;S&#x27; and/or it may\n\npose any serious threat to her life, body and future maternity.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_15\">7.   During the course of proceedings, Court asked to learned\n\ncounsel appearing for the petitioner as to whether the petitioner\n\n&#x27;S&#x27; and her mother are determined to get the pregnancy\n\nterminated or they are prepared for other alternative; more\n\nparticularly handing over the prospective baby to some social\n\norganization or shelter home etc. With respect to Court&#x27;s concern,\n\nlearned counsel sought some time to complete his instructions.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_16\">8.   During the proceedings of 15th October, 2019, Mr. Vivek\n\nShrimali, learned counsel, put in appearance and volunteered that\n\nhe has association with an organization, which is involved in\n\nphilanthropic and welfare activities of embracing the destituted,\n\nabandoned and orphan children and then raising them, which may\n\nvolunteer to bear the expenses of the delivery, so also take the\n\ncustody of the child for his/her upbringing, if the Court so permits.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_17\">9.   Pursuant to the direction given by this Court, a Medical Board\n\nhas examined the petitioner and gave report dated 16.10.2019 to\n\nthe effect that she is having pregnancy of 25 weeks 3 days. It will\n\nbe apt to reproduce the opinion expressed by the Medical Board:-\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">     &quot;In opinion of Medical Board, she is 25 W 3 D pregnancy\n     (by sonography) with single live fetus, her blood\n     investigations are within normal limits and she does not\n     have any complication of pregnancy. At present her\n     condition seems to be suggestive that there is no serious\n     threat to her life in termination of pregnancy. However,\n     at the time of termination or after termination risk of\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                    (Downloaded on 18/10/2019 at 08:49:23 PM)</span>\n                                          (4 of 15)                 [CW-14827/2019]\n\n\n      known medical        or    surgical      complication       cannot    be\n      denied.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_18\">10.   An application has been moved by a society &#x27;Navjeevan\n\nSansthan&#x27; - running an orphanage &#x27;Luv Kush Bal Vikas Kendra\n\ninter alia, volunteering to bear the expenses of the delivery and\n\nundertake the responsibility of raising and maintaining the child to\n\nbe born.     It has been stated in the application that applicant\n\ninstitution is a Society registered under the <a href=\"/doc/150437336/\" id=\"a_5\">Rajasthan Societies\n\nRegistration Act, 1958</a> and has been set up with an object to\n\nprotect    abandoned     and      destituted         children.    The   State    of\n\nRajasthan, vide its order dated 21.12.1989, has recognized and\n\ndeclared it as &quot;A fit Institution to work for the Welfare of\n\nabandoned and destituted children&quot;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_19\">11.   Learned counsel for the petitioner, however, maintained that\n\npetitioner   wants   termination         of    pregnancy.        Inviting   Court&#x27;s\n\nattention towards explanation I to Sub-section (2) of <a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 3</a> of\n\nthe MTP Act, he contended that the rape itself is to be treated as\n\ngrave injury to the mental health of the pregnant woman.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\">12.   In support of his contentions, learned counsel invited Court&#x27;s\n\nattention towards the judgment dated 29.01.2019, passed by this\n\nCourt in Nisha Vaishnav Vs. State of Rajasthan &amp; Ors. (S.B.\n\nCivil Writ Petition No.1271/2019) and submitted that this\n\nCourt, while dealing with the law on the subject and various\n\ndecisions, has permitted termination of pregnancy in almost\n\nsimilar facts, when the pregnancy was of 22 weeks.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_21\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"172163761\" id=\"span_4\">13.   Mr. Pankaj Sharma, learned Additional Advocate General\n\nappearing for the respondent State, assisted the Court by saying\n\nthat as far as termination of pregnancy of &#x27;S&#x27;, in the present case,\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                     (Downloaded on 18/10/2019 at 08:49:23 PM)</span>\n                                            (5 of 15)                  [CW-14827/2019]\n\n\nis concerned, the same can legally be carried out in light of the\n\nseries of judgments, including the recent judgment of Hon&#x27;ble the\n\nSupreme Court being <a href=\"/doc/172163761/\" id=\"a_7\">Z Vs. State of Bihar &amp; Ors.</a> reported in\n\n(2018) 11 SCC 572.                He added that in some cases, even\n\npregnancy of 31 weeks has been allowed to be terminated, of\n\ncourse, looking to the health condition of the pregnant lady and\n\nthe foetus.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_22\">14.   In response to the application filed by the Society, learned\n\nAAG fairly urged that the State cannot and does not have any\n\nobjection, if the application of the Society is granted, while\n\nassuring that State would nevertheless provide all possible help to\n\nthe petitioner.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_23\">15.   Mr. Vivek Shrimali, learned counsel appearing for applicant\n\nSansthan      submitted      that      when       the     applicant    society     has\n\nvolunteered not to just take care of the delivery but has also\n\nexpressed desire to nurture the child by providing for his future\n\nneeds,   the      termination     of    pregnancy          should     not   even   be\n\nconsidered as an option.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_24\">16.   This Court is seized with an exigent scenario - a question of\n\nlife and death; a choice of dignified life of &#x27;S&#x27;, who is voicing her\n\ncause through her mother vis-a-vis a baby to be born, who can\n\ncaress or kick her mother but does not have voice of its own. On\n\nthe one hand, petitioner- a victim unequivocally desirous to get rid\n\nof her 26 weeks&#x27; old foetus and on the other hand - a social\n\norganization, which has advanced its desire to not just protect a\n\nlife but help it bloom.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_25\">17.   The medical termination of pregnancy is permissible in cases\n\ncovered by Explanations - 1 and 2 of <a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 3</a> of the Act of 1971.\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                       (Downloaded on 18/10/2019 at 08:49:23 PM)</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_26\">                                         (6 of 15)               [CW-14827/2019]\n\n\nThis Court has no doubt that in the present case the order as\n\nprayed can be passed, but should it be passed is the moot\n\nquestion. In the opinion of this Court, medical termination of\n\npregnancy is permissible for the purpose of protecting the victim,\n\nfrom the trauma of being ravished, coupled with the fact that &#x27;the\n\nbaby to be born&#x27; will remain with her and continue to remind her\n\nof the offence committed. The baby, in turn, would cause and\n\ncontinue to cause mental agony.             Abortion is also imperative so\n\nthat the victim can settle in life, and the baby does not emerge as\n\nsnag in her otherwise smooth life - termination is necessary to\n\nsever the maternal tie with the baby.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_27\">18.   But is it the only way to sever the bond between the baby\n\nand the mother? Perhaps no. A bond can be disconnected in other\n\nways and by other means too......\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\">19.   While preserving the right to life of &#x27;S&#x27;, this Court cannot be\n\noblivious of the right to life of the &#x27;child to be born&#x27;. It is a well\n\nknown fact that after six weeks, life is infused in the embryo, thus\n\nconverting it into foetus. Once an embryo evolves into a foetus,\n\nthe heart starts beating. In considered opinion of this Court, right\n\nto life of that foetus merits or deserves equal protection, if not\n\nmore. Within a period of 16-20 weeks, the foetus/baby is\n\ncompletely formed and thereafter, it is mostly biological growth in\n\nthe womb.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_29\">20.   The Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court has held in unexceptionable terms\n\nthat the approach of the Court in MTP Cases has to be fact-\n\nspecific; each case depends on its own facts, and no straight\n\njacket rule can be laid down.

There is however another principle, more of a\n\nperemptory norm, in the form of the right to life.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_41\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1500783\" id=\"span_12\">24.   There is a compelling State Interest in protecting the right to\n\nlife of prospective child as held by Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court in <a href=\"/doc/1500783/\" id=\"a_17\">Suchita\n\nSrivastava v. Chandigarh Admn.</a>, (2009) 9 SCC 1 :</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">      &quot;21. <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_18\">When the MTP Act</a> was first enacted in 1971 it was\n      largely modelled on the Abortion Act of 1967 which had\n      been passed in the United Kingdom. The legislative intent\n      was to provide a qualified &quot;right to abortion&quot; and the\n      termination of pregnancy has never been recognised as a\n      normal recourse for expecting mothers.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">      22. There is no doubt that a woman&#x27;s right to make\n      reproductive choices is also a dimension of &quot;personal\n      liberty&quot; as understood under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_19\">Article 21</a> of the\n      Constitution of India. ...........\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">      ........However, in the case of pregnant women there is\n      also a &quot;compelling State interest&quot; in protecting the life of\n      the prospective child. Therefore, the termination of a\n      pregnancy is only permitted when the conditions\n      specified in the applicable statute have been fulfilled.\n      Hence, the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_20\">MTP Act, 1971</a> can also be\n      viewed as reasonable restrictions that have been placed\n      on the exercise of reproductive choices.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">      34. In the impugned orders, the High Court has in fact\n      agreed with the proposition that a literal reading of\n      <a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 3</a> of the MTP Act would lead to the conclusion\n      that a mentally retarded woman should give her consent\n      in order to proceed with the termination of a pregnancy.\n      However, the High Court has invoked the doctrine of\n      &quot;parens patriae&quot; while exercising its writ jurisdiction to\n      go beyond the literal interpretation of the statute and\n      adopt a purposive approach. The same doctrine has been\n      used to arrive at the conclusion that the termination of\n      pregnancy would serve the &quot;best interests&quot; of the victim\n      in the present case even though she has not given her\n      consent for the same. We are unable to accept that line\n      of reasoning.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">      35. The doctrine of &quot;parens patriae&quot; has been evolved in\n      common law and is applied in situations where the State\n      must make decisions in order to protect the interests of\n      those persons who are unable to take care of\n      themselves. Traditionally this doctrine has been applied\n      in cases involving the rights of minors and those persons\n      who have been found to be mentally incapable of making\n      informed decisions for themselves.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">      36. Courts in other common law jurisdictions have\n      developed two distinct standards while exercising\n      &quot;parens patriae&quot; jurisdiction for the purpose of making\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                    (Downloaded on 18/10/2019 at 08:49:23 PM)</span>\n                                         (10 of 15)              [CW-14827/2019]\n\n\n      reproductive decisions on behalf of mentally retarded\n      persons. These two standards are the &quot;best interests&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_42\">      test and the &quot;substituted judgment&quot; test.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_43\">      37. As evident from its literal description, the &quot;best\n      interests&quot; test requires the Court to ascertain the course\n      of action which would serve the best interests of the\n      person in question. In the present setting this means\n      that the Court must undertake a careful inquiry of the\n      medical opinion on the feasibility of the pregnancy as\n      well as social circumstances faced by the victim. It is\n      important to note that the Court&#x27;s decision should be\n      guided by the interests of the victim alone and not those\n      of the other stakeholders such as guardians or the\n      society in general. It is evident that the woman in\n      question will need care and assistance which will in turn\n      entail some costs. However, that cannot be a ground for\n      denying the exercise of reproductive rights.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_44\">      38. The application of the &quot;substituted judgment&quot; test\n      requires the Court to step into the shoes of a person who\n      is considered to be mentally incapable and attempt to\n      make the decision which the said person would have\n      made, if she was competent to do so. This is a more\n      complex inquiry but this test can only be applied to make\n      decisions on behalf of persons who are conclusively\n      shown to be mentally incompetent.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_45\">      39. In the present case the victim has been described as\n      a person suffering from &quot;mild mental retardation&quot;. This\n      does not mean that she is entirely incapable of making\n      decisions for herself. The findings recorded by the expert\n      body indicate that her mental age is close to that of a\n      nine-year-old child and that she is capable of learning\n      through rote memorisation and imitation. Even the\n      preliminary medical opinion indicated that she had learnt\n      to perform basic bodily functions and was capable of\n      simple communications. In light of these findings, it is\n      the &quot;best interests&quot; test alone which should govern the\n      inquiry in the present case and not the &quot;substituted\n      judgment&quot; test.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_46\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_47\">25.   Given that the prospective child in womb has no say in the\n\npresent proceedings, this Court has to substitute itself as the\n\nparent - the Parens Patriae and do a balancing exercise. This\n\nCourt is to decide between the great mental agony that the\n\nPetitioner has to bear as against the right to life of the unborn\n\nchild. The Legislature in its wisdom has not given an absolute and\n\nunfettered right to abort, but has restricted it in a phase wise and\n\nstage wise manner. The two explanations appended to <a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_22\">Sec. 3</a>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                    (Downloaded on 18/10/2019 at 08:49:23 PM)</span>\n                                            (11 of 15)                [CW-14827/2019]\n\n\nserve     as   guiding      principles       (though        not    exhaustive)     for\n\ninterpretation of what constitutes mental agony.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_48\">26.     However, the entire scheme of <a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_23\">Sec. 3</a> applies in two stages,\n\none up to 12 weeks, and second from 12 to 20 weeks. In the case\n\nat hand, the threshold set by the Legislature has crossed as the\n\npregnancy has crossed the cut-off period of 20 weeks. <a href=\"/doc/1891528/\" id=\"a_24\">Sec. 5</a>\n\ntakes into consideration the eventuality of 20 weeks threshold\n\nbeing crossed, and further limits the discretion available to permit\n\ntermination of pregnancy.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_49\">27.     What constitutes an agony is subjective and only the\n\nPetitioner can feel the real pain of being a victim of an act as\n\nabhorrent      as   Rape.    No     words       can     describe     her   pain,   no\n\nexpressions can meet her anguish.                    Given the predicament at\n\nhand, this Court feels constrained in applying the judgments cited,\n\nand is forced to take up a case-specific evaluation. This balancing\n\nexercise is necessitated due to the 20 weeks threshold having\n\nbeen crossed, where the mental agony is a relevant factor for\n\npermitting termination of pregnancy. Post the 20 weeks threshold,\n\nthe mental agony remains, may even become more excruciating,\n\nbut the Court cannot be unmindful of the voice of the &#x27;yet to be\n\nborn&#x27; - a fully alive prospective child in the womb.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_50\">28.     While doing this balancing exercise, this Court has two very\n\nstriking factors to reckon - the adoloscent age of &#x27;S&#x27; - 17 years;\n\nand that the petition has been filed by victim&#x27;s widow mother. She\n\ncan naturally see the social stigma and feel the turmoil of her\n\ndaughter, but cannot possibly perceive the feeling of a mother\n\ncarrying a baby. On the other hand is standing an NGO, which is\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                       (Downloaded on 18/10/2019 at 08:49:23 PM)</span>\n                                           (12 of 15)              [CW-14827/2019]\n\n\nmore than willing to protect unborn life while assuring the dignified\n\nlife of the petitioner.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_51\">29.   The Medical Termination of Pregnancy is statutory in nature,\n\nwith constitutional underpinnings, on the other hand the right to\n\nlife is flowing directly from <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_25\">Art. 21.</a> The Petitioner who is pregnant\n\nis carrying a life, and the &quot;compelling State interest&quot; in preserving\n\nlife has to be balanced vis-à-vis the right of the Petitioner as a\n\nrape victim from suffering unnecessary mental agony. In this\n\nanalysis, relying on the judgments cited above, this Court has to\n\nbe alive to the excruciating mental agony of the Petitioner and it\n\nhas to also hear the voice of the unheard &quot;foetus in womb&quot;;a\n\nhuman being which too is alive, though yet to be born.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_52\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"172163761\" id=\"span_16\">30.   Taking strength from the constitutional position, where\n\n&quot;bodily integrity&quot; is a facet inter alia of the right to life, whereas\n\n&quot;being alive&quot; is the right to life; this Court is constrained to hold\n\nthat the per-se right to life of the prospective child needs to be\n\ngiven precedence over the right of the Petitioner, particularly in the\n\ngiven situation. The Court being mindful of what the Petitioner\n\nwould go through, and placing reliance on the law enunciated in <a href=\"/doc/172163761/\" id=\"a_26\">Z\n\nv. State of Bihar</a>, (2018) 11 SCC 572 (para 48-57) proposes to\n\npass following directions for ensuring comfortable pregnancy and\n\ndelivery, in a setup that must guarantee utmost privacy and\n\nrespect for the dignity of the Petitioner.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_53\">31.   Hence, right to life of the foetus is also required to be\n\nconsidered. Right to life guaranteed by the Constitution of India\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_27\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India, cannot be invoked for\n\nthe victim alone. Protection of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_28\">Article 21</a> is as much available to\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                      (Downloaded on 18/10/2019 at 08:49:23 PM)</span>\n                                           (13 of 15)              [CW-14827/2019]\n\n\nthe child to be born, unless protection of foetus poses an eminent\n\nthreat to the life of mother.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_54\">32.   In the facts obtaining in the present case, when the applicant\n\nsociety has volunteered, this Court is not inclined to permit\n\nmedical termination of the pregnancy, as prayed by the petitioner\n\n&#x27;S&#x27; and instead deems it appropriate in the interest of the &#x27;yet to\n\nbe born baby&#x27; to allow the application filed by the applicant -\n\nSociety &#x27; Navjeewan Sansthan&#x27;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_55\">33. However, with a view to strike the balance between the right\n\nto privacy of the victim &#x27;S&#x27; and the right to life of the &#x27;child to be\n\nborn&#x27;, this Court deems it appropriate to pass the following\n\ndirections:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">      (i)     To maintain the secrecy of her pregnancy, the State will\n\n              ensure petitioner&#x27;s admission in Nari Niketan, Jodhpur\n\n              until her delivery and convalescence.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">      (ii)    State will also permit petitioner&#x27;s mother to live with\n\n              her to give moral and emotional support.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">      (iii)   In case &#x27;S&#x27; and her mother wish to live in their own\n\n              residence, they may do so.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">      (iv) If the petitioner and her mother move to Nari Niketan,\n\n              Jodhpur, the State will ensure safe delivery of the child\n\n              at the place where she resides.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">      (v)     In case the petitioner refuses to be admitted to Nari\n\n              Niketan, Jodhpur, the CMHO, Churu-respondent No.5\n\n              and if she comes to Nari Niketan, Jodhpur then CMHO,\n\n              Jodhpur will ensure requisite pre-natal and post-natal\n\n              medical care.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                      (Downloaded on 18/10/2019 at 08:49:23 PM)</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">                                          (14 of 15)              [CW-14827/2019]\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">      (vi) After the birth of the child, the custody of the child will\n\n            be handed over to the applicant &quot;Navjeewan Sansthan&quot;,\n\n            as soon as feasible, of course after taking consent of\n\n            &#x27;S&#x27;, her mother and a fitness certificate of paediatrician.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">      (vii) This Court has no doubt that the applicant society will\n\n            take utmost care of the child to be born.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">      (viii) For a period of 12 months, the society (Navjeewan\n\n            Sansthan) will not give such child in adoption or\n\n            otherwise.
