We find that under the <a href=\"/doc/1059693/\" id=\"a_14\">Customs Act</a>, there is no provision granting\n\npower to the department to review an order passed under <a href=\"/doc/110078382/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 110A</a> and\n\naccordingly the impugned order is bad in law. This view gets support from the\n\ndecision of Gauhati High court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/71551682/\" id=\"a_16\">Dharampal Satyapal Ltd.</a> (supra)\n\nwhich reads as under:</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_33\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">            &quot;26. It is well settled that a Court or Tribunal or adjudicating\n\n       authority becomes functus officio (ceases to have control over the\n\n       matter) once a judgment is pronounced or the order is made. Such\n\n       judgment and order, when becomes final, cannot be altered, changed,\n\n       varied or modified unless the statute, whereunder the Court, Tribunal\n\n       or the adjudicating authority functions, so permit. There can also be\n\n       no doubt that the power of review is not an inherent power. The right\n\n       to seek review of an order is neither natural nor fundamental right of\n\n       an aggrieved party. Such power must be conferred by law. If there is\n\n       no power of review, the order cannot be reviewed. However, a Court,\n\n       having plenary power, is not affected by any statutory restrictions in\n\n       reviewing its own order. In Patel Narshi Thakershi v. Pradyumansinghji\n\n       Arjunsinghji, reported in (1971) 3 SCC 844, the Supreme Court, while\n\n       dealing with the provisions of Saurashtra Land Reforms Act, 1951, and\n\n       referring to Order 47 Rule 1 of the CPC, held that there is no inherent\n\n       power of review with the adjudicating authority if it is not conferred by\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\"> 9|Page                                                     C/10185/2022-DB\n\n       law. The observations read, &quot;It is well settled that the power to review\n\n       is not an inherent power. It must be conferred by law either specifically\n\n       or by necessary implication. No provision in the Act was brought to\n\n       (our) notice from which it could be gathered that the Government had\n\n       power to review its own order, it is obvious that its delegate could not\n\n       have reviewed its order.&quot; The position of law, so <a href=\"/doc/71551682/\" id=\"a_17\">laid down in</a> Patel\n\n       Narshi Thakershi (supra), has been reiterated by the Supreme Court in\n\n       other later cases.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_34\">17.

Be that as it may, the condition of furnishing the bank guarantee to the\n\nextent of 15% of the value of goods or 15% of the duty value itself requires\n\nto be tested in terms of the law delivered on the issue in the case of <a href=\"/doc/75402389/\" id=\"a_19\">Amit\n\nEnterprises v Union of India</a> (supra), wherein the Hon&#x27;ble Punjab and Haryana\n\nwas pleased to modify the condition of furnishing of bank guarantee of 25%\n\nof the market value of the seized goods on the ground that the petitioner\n 10 | P a g e                                                   C/10185/2022-DB\n\ntherein had paid duty as per the valuation of the department. The relevant\n\nextract of the said decisions is reproduced below:</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_38\">         &quot;11. We find merit in the contention that requirement of giving a\n\n         declaration that the petitioner will not challenge the value of the goods,\n\n         is unreasonable and arbitrary. The petitioner cannot be debarred from\n\n         asserting its version as to the value and classification of goods. If such\n\n         a condition is allowed to be imposed, the department can unilaterally\n\n         allege any valuation and continue to keep the goods under detention\n\n         unless the affected party agrees to withdraw the challenge to the\n\n         valuation. This will amount to denial of justice. Similarly, requirement\n\n         of furnishing bank guarantee equal to 25% of the full market value of\n\n         the seized goods is also, in the facts and circumstances of the case,\n\n         arbitrary. Mere fact that condition of 10% of bank guarantee was\n\n         upheld by this Court in T.L. Verma and M/s. Kundan Rice Mills cannot\n\n         be justification to impose such conditions in each and every case. In\n\n         those cases, this Court was satisfied that the importers had adopted\n\n         fraudulent tactics which, prima facie, justified opinion for confiscation\n\n         of goods. The said judgments cannot apply to every case of detention.\n\n         Mere allegation of liability to confiscation is not enough. Circumstances\n\n         and grounds justifying opinion about liability to confiscation is open to\n\n         judicial scrutiny.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_40\">         12. Power of detention of goods is a drastic power and exercise of\n\n         such power has to be hedged by safeguards to check its abuse and\n\n         limit its exercise only to situation where it is intended by law to be\n\n         exercised. Existence of power and exercise of power are independent.\n\n         Mere fact that there is a power to confiscate does not mean that such\n\n         power could be exercised mechanically or arbitrarily. The authority\n\n         exercising such power must strictly justify the same. Balance has to be\n\n         maintained between the need for exercise of such power for the\n\n         purpose for which the same has been conferred and adverse effects on\n\n         rights of a citizen.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_41\"> 11 | P a g e                                                     C/10185/2022-DB\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_42\">         <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1766147\" id=\"span_7\">13.

In all the above cases the condition to furnish bank guarantee on the\n\nvalue of goods was deleted.

The present case stands at a better footing as the Appellant is agreeable\n\nto pay entire duty to secure provisional release of goods. As evident from the\n\nBills of entry, the appellant was always willing to deposit the entire duty of\n\nBCD + IGST which is over 25 crores and therefore, the condition to direct the\n\nappellant to furnish a bank guarantee of 15% of the value of the goods which\n\nis over 100 crores is excessive and arbitrary more importantly when the\n\nappellant is willing to deposit the duty payable on the seized goods. There is\n\nno dispute on the valuation or classification of the goods as is clear from the\n\nimpugned provisional release order.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_78\"> 17 | P a g e                                             C/10185/2022-DB\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_79\">24.     Looking at the facts of the present case, we find that the law laid down\n\nin the aforesaid decisions is squarely applicable to the facts of the present\n\ncase as well and the condition to direct the Appellant to furnish bank guarantee\n\nof 15% of the value of goods is arbitrary, excessive and bad in law.\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_80\">25.     A perusal of the seizure memo clarifies that it is the case of the\n\ndepartment that the goods in the present case were imported from Iran as\n\nagainst the declared country viz., Zambia. Keeping the above allegation in\n\nmind, the department had seized the goods imported vide 4 impugned Bills of\n\nEntry. The argument of the appellant that no benefit is accrued to the\n\nappellant by allegedly mis-declaring the Country of Origin as they were always\n\nwilling to pay the entire duty payable on these goods without even the\n\nconsidering the said COO cannot be ruled out and have to bear in mind when\n\nconditions for provisional release was decided under the approval of the\n\nRespondent. Also, that the department before this Tribunal has not\n\ncontroverted the submissions of the Appellant that in terms of para 2.18 of\n\nthe Foreign Trade Policy, the goods are freely importable even when imported\n\nfrom Iran. In other words it is not even the case of the department before us\n\nthat there was any restriction on import of goods from Iran. Further it is a\n\nsettled law that an importer unless proven otherwise beyond doubt cannot be\n\nsaid to have any role in the issuance of a COO as the same is issued by the\n\ncompetent authority of the originating country.\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_81\">26.     However, at this point in time, it is also important to note that the\n\ninvestigation is ongoing and country of origin of the goods will be determined\n\nonly after the investigation is concluded. At this point of time, it cannot be\n\nsaid with certainty that the goods were imported from Iran. Be that as it may,\n\nthe issue before this Tribunal is limited to the provisional release of goods and\n\nthe same need to be decided keeping in mind the fact that the Appellant never\n 18 | P a g e                                                 C/10185/2022-DB\n\nintended to avail any benefit basis the COO and were and are willing to pay\n\nthe duty on the goods imported vide the 4 bills of entry.\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_82\">27.      As per our above discussion and case laws, we are of the view that the\nconditions imposed in the impugned provision release order is not justified\nand correct. However keeping in mind the interest of justice and safeguard of\nrevenue&#x27;s interest also, we hold that the seized goods shall be released\nprovisionally on payment of custom duty on the conditions that the appellant\nshall execute a bond of full value of the seized imported goods and shall\nfurnish bank guarantee of Rs. 1 Crore (Rs. One Crore Only). The Appeal is\nallowed in the above terms.
