While COVID-19 was wreaking havoc in the country and\ncausing unimaginable misery [viz. the working class losing jobs and\nthereby their livelihood, innumerable innocent lives being lost including\nthose of migrant labours not only due to its direct but also indirect\neffects, the health-care system in all the States across the country facing\nextreme stress, justice seekers finding the justice delivery system almost\ninaccessible, etc.] and thus creating an atmosphere of severe tension\nand despair in the country, the unnatural death of a relatively young\nfilm actor (hereafter &quot;the actor&quot;, for short) in Mumbai on June 14, 2020\nbecame the cynosure of the electronic media. The manifold problem,\nhardship and inconvenience brought about by the pandemic all over the\ncountry   notwithstanding,    various      TV     channels    initiated    intense\ndiscussion during prime time on the probable cause of death of the\nactor. Some of such channels, resorting to &quot;investigative journalism&quot; as\nthey call it, sought to spread the message among its viewers that\nMumbai Police has been passing off a homicidal death as a suicidal\ndeath and that a close acquaintance of the actor, who herself is an\nactress (hereafter &quot;the actress&quot;, for short), had orchestrated his death.\nWhat followed such reportage is noteworthy. The actor&#x27;s father had\nlodged an FIR at Patna, Bihar naming the actress as an accused for his\nson&#x27;s homicidal death. Incidentally, the actor hailed from Bihar prior to\nmaking a career in films and settling down in Mumbai. To conduct\ninvestigation into such FIR, police personnel from Bihar landed in\nMumbai.    Citing   the   pandemic,        such   personnel     were      promptly\nquarantined. It is not necessary for the present purpose to ascertain\nwho were behind such move and what the motive was. Suffice it to note,\nthe actress applied before the Supreme Court for transfer of a First\nInformation Report at a police station in Patna and all consequential\nproceedings from the jurisdictional court at Patna to the jurisdictional\ncourt at Mumbai, under <a href=\"/doc/664789/\" id=\"a_1\">section 406</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure\n(hereafter &#x27;the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_2\">Cr.P.C</a>&#x27; for short) read with Order XXXIX of the Supreme\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                       14</span>\n                                                   Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\nCourt Rules. Upon hearing the parties, the Supreme Court passed an\norder dated August 19, 2020 entrusting the Central Bureau of\nInvestigation (hereafter &quot;the CBI&quot;, for short) with investigation into the\ncomplaint of the actor&#x27;s father. In compliance with such order, the CBI\ntook over investigation. In due course of time, the Enforcement\nDirectorate (hereafter &quot;the ED&quot;, for short) and the Narcotics Control\nBureau (hereafter &quot;the NCB&quot;, for short) too joined the fray by launching\nseparate prosecution suspecting offences under the <a href=\"/doc/1697463/\" id=\"a_3\">Prevention of Money\nLaundering Act, 2002</a> and the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_4\">Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic\nSubstances Act, 1985</a> (hereafter &quot;the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_5\">NDPS Act</a>&quot;, for short), respectively.\nAfter the intervention of the Supreme Court, it had been the claim of\nsome of the TV channels that Mumbai Police&#x27;s vicious attempt to\nsuppress the homicidal death of the actor, which had been unearthed by\n&quot;investigative journalism&quot;, stands validated by reason of the order of the\nSupreme Court. It had also been the claim of one of the TV channels\nthat because of its persistent vigorous demands for divesting Mumbai\nPolice of investigative powers in the case that truth has triumphed with\nthe CBI being entrusted with the investigation by the Supreme Court.\nInvestigation by the CBI, the ED and the NCB are still in progress.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_2\">2.           Apart from the above, a couple of TV channels aired several\nprogrammes raising questions as to the manner of investigation by\nMumbai Police and also as to why the actress had not been arrested in\nview   of   materials   that   such   channels   had   gathered     through\n&quot;investigative journalism&quot;. One of them even went to the extent of\nobtaining opinion from the viewers on whether the actress should be\narrested. One other channel flashed that the actor had been murdered.\nThe persistent efforts of the channels for arrest of the actress did bear\nfruit in that although the CBI did not find reason to arrest her, she came\nto be arrested by the NCB. After a monthlong incarceration, this Court\nby its order dated October 7, 2020 granted the actress bail upon\nrecording a finding that materials collected thus far by the NCB prima\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                       15</span>\n                                                          Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\nfacie did not suggest that she had committed any offence under the\n<a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_6\">NDPS Act</a>.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_3\">3.            Unfortunately, some of the TV channels in their programmes\ndisplayed headlines which, in effect, taunt the actor for committing\nsuicide and seek to question as to whether he was into consumption of\ndrugs. The insensitivity of such TV channels is writ large in that the\nheadlines/questions were displayed/posed knowing fully well that the\nsame would never be rebutted by the individual to whom it is directed.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_4\">4.            Since the unnatural death of the actor on June 14, 2020, 5\n(five) writ petitions, all in the Public Interest Litigation jurisdiction, came\nto be presented before this Court between June 25, 2020 and September\n10, 2020 seeking multifarious relief.       All but one of the writ petitions\nraise common issues in regard to the role of the electronic media in\nreporting matters concerning investigation into the unnatural death of\nthe actor, thus amounting to a &#x27;media trial&#x27;. The petitioners urge that\nthe electronic media in derogation of their legitimate media rights are\nbroadcasting irresponsible and unethical news programmes of a nature\namounting to slander as also amounting to a direct interference in the\ncourse of investigation, as undertaken by the investigating agencies, of a\nhighly prejudicial nature. The petitioners contend that some of the\ntelevision channels have televised interviews with material witnesses\nand in fact indulged in cross-examining these witnesses. They have\ntaken   upon    themselves    the    role   of   the    investigating         agencies,\nprosecutors    and    adjudicators   in     pronouncing        persons    guilty     of\ncommitting an offence, even before the lawful investigation is completed\nby the investigating agencies. It is claimed that the news channels have\nalso resorted to a reckless reporting against the State agencies on whom\nthe   powers    of   investigation   are    conferred     by     law.    It    is   the\npetitioners&#x27;contention that such interference by the electronic media in\nthe course of lawful investigation of any alleged crime defies all cannons\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                      16</span>\n                                                    Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\nof legal legitimacy. It is with such grievances the petitioners have\napproached this Court. In brief, the reliefs claimed, inter-alia, are for\nissuance of necessary directions to the media channels for temporary\npostponement of news reporting in any form of a media trial or parallel\ninvestigation into the &#x27;FIR&#x27; regarding the unnatural death of the actor\nthat the CBI has been investigating. Prayer is also made for a writ of\nmandamus for issuance of directions/guidelines not to allow electronic,\nradio, internet or any other form of media from publishing any false,\nderogatory and scandalous news reports which may either jeopardize\nthe reputation of the police and affect administration of justice, and to\nhave a balanced ethical and objective reporting. There is also a prayer in\none of the writ petitions that the scope and ambit of <a href=\"/doc/1689734/\" id=\"a_7\">section 3(2)</a> of the\nContempt of Courts Act, 1971 (hereafter the CoC Act, for short) be\ninterpreted to include an FIR as the starting point of pending\nproceedings before the Court for the purpose of invoking the CoC Act in\ncases where publication obstructs administration of justice. Having\nnoticed the broad contours of the proceedings before us, we now proceed\nto delve deep into the individual writ petitions.\n</p>\n\n\n<pre id=\"pre_3\">4A.    Briefly about the petitions:-\n\nI.     Public Interest Litigation PIL-CJ-LD-VC-NO.40 OF 2020\n\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_5\">       (Asim Suhas Sarode Vs. News Broadcasting Association (NBA)\n       &amp; Ors.)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_6\">(a).        This Public Interest Litigation, the first in the series, was\npresented before this Court on June 25, 2020 by Shri. Asim Suhas\nSarode as petitioner, who is a practicing Advocate. He claims that he\nhas been working on various human rights and environmental issues.\nThe concern of the petitioner is that immediately on the unnatural death\nof the actor on June 14, 2020, the TV channels started reporting the\nnews of his suicide. He says that the telecasts on the suicide, in the\nmanner aired, left him disturbed, as the news coverage contained\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                     17</span>\n                                                    Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\nphotographs of the dead body of the actor which was least that could be\nexpected.   He says that such an approach on the part of the media\nshows insensitive attitude towards mental health. He has stated that\nvarious FIRs were lodged including those by the Maharashtra Cyber Cell\nPolice department, by issuing warning on Twitter to restrain from\nposting images of a dead body. It is his case that the media needs to\npractice sensitivity in such reporting, and the media professionals\nshould recognize the importance in conveying nuanced meanings and\nthe language should not sensationalize suicide. It is his case that there\nare media guidelines issued by the World Health Organization (hereafter\n&quot;the WHO&quot;, for short) and the International Association for Suicide\nPrevention (IASP) on how news organizations should report on suicides,\nwhich need to be followed. His case is that there is a necessity to\nunderstand depression and how it affects people. The media reports\ncannot be more depressing because the media is required to consider\nthe impact of such news on people, who are living with mental illness.\nNo one chooses to be depressed or stay depressed. Their brain does not\nallow them to come out of it. The Press Council of India (hereafter &quot;the\nPCI&quot;, for short) has adopted the guidelines of the WHO; however, they\nare not followed by the media in India.       As per the WHO guidelines\nadopted by the PCI, according to the petitioner, following are required to\nbe avoided:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">            &quot;1.   Publish stories about suicide prominently\n            and unduly repeat such stories.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">            2.

The   petitioner   contends    that   implementation       of   the\nobjectives of the <a href=\"/doc/185191195/\" id=\"a_8\">Mental Health Act, 2017</a> is lacking in totality, when it\nrecognizes suicide as a mental illness. Almost all media houses used the\nword &quot;committed suicide&quot;, when it should be &quot;died by suicide&quot;. On such\npremise, the petitioner has prayed for the following reliefs:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">            &quot;(A) The Hon&#x27;ble High Court be pleased to\n            issue writ of mandamus or writ in the nature of\n            mandamus or any other appropriate writ\n            directing the Respondents-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">                   (i)   To file an affidavit before the Hon&#x27;ble\n                   Court mentioning that they will inform all\n                   their members to abide by the guidelines\n                   issued by the Press Council of India and\n                   WHO.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">                   (ii)  To submit on the affidavit, the\n                   standard operating process (SOP) of\n                   functioning by the respondents while\n                   reporting and publishing news report\n                   related to death due to suicide by any\n                   celebrity or anyone.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">                   (iii) To mention on the affidavit that they\n                   will   inform   to   its    members      to\n                   print/broadcast information on mental\n                   health awareness and suicide prevention\n                   every quarter.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">                   (iv) To run information scroll on TV\n                   channels during examination and results\n                   period about assistance available if one\n                   feels suicidal so that people are aware as\n                   dated we have seen high suicide rates\n                   during exam and result time.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">            (B)   Petitioner urges that Hon&#x27;ble High Court to please\n            interpret suicide as a mental illness and clarify it is not a\n            crime.&quot;\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                     19</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">                                                     Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\nII.

Shri Nilesh Navlakha\nhas described himself to be a reputed filmmaker, who has produced\nnine films on social issues, and is a recipient of national awards for his\nthree films. He is also a social activist involved in various social causes.\nPetitioner No. 2 - Shri. Mahibub Shaikh, is the editor of a regional\nnewspaper &#x27;Bandhuprem&#x27;, published from Solapur. Petitioner No. 3 -\nShri. Subash Cander Chaba has retired from the Punjab State\nElectricity Board and is also actively involved on social issues. The\npetitioners array the Union of India (hereafter &#x27;the UOI&#x27;, for short)\nthrough its Secretary, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, the\nPCI, the News Broadcasters Association, the CBI, the State of\nMaharashtra and several media channels as the respondents. The\npetitioners pray that directions be issued to the electronic media\nchannels as also to the print media for temporary postponement of news\nreporting in any manner, which would tantamount to a &#x27;media trial&#x27; or\n&#x27;parallel investigation&#x27; of a nature directly or indirectly hampering the\ninvestigation in pursuance of the FIR registered by the CBI, relating to\nthe unnatural death of the actor. There is a prayer for further direction\nto the respondents to ensure that the tenets of the &quot;Programme Code&quot; as\nprescribed under the <a href=\"/doc/1776076/\" id=\"a_9\">Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act, 1995</a>\n(hereafter the &quot;CTVN Act&quot;, for short) and Cable Television Networks\nRules, 1994 (hereafter the &quot;CTVN Rules&quot;, for short) are followed in letter\nand spirit. The Petitioners also pray that the respondents keep strict\nvigil on the media channels in sensitive cases and adhere to the CTVN\nAct and the CTVN Rules and take stringent actions against the media\nchannels who violate the &quot;Programme Code&quot; and the journalistic ethics.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_10\">(b)           The petitioners contend that they do not intend to impinge\nor curtail the freedom of press of the media; however, in the interest of\nadministration of justice, they are seeking such directions to the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                      20</span>\n                                                     Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\nrespondents to toe the &#x27;Lakshman Rekha&#x27; and ensure that no media trial\nis undertaken, which has an impact of causing a prejudice to an\nindependent investigation being undertaken by the CBI. The petitioners\nsay that the media trial in the death of actor is posing real and\nsubstantial risk of prejudice to the proper administration of justice and\nthe criminal justice system, and the fairness of a trial. They contend\nthat a neutralizing device (balancing act) would not be an unreasonable\nrestriction on the media rights and on the contrary would fall within the\nproper constitutional framework. The contention is that the journalists\nare expected to be fair and neutral to all sides, and to provide diverse\npoints of view. They are against propaganda news, their concern is that\n&#x27;pure&#x27; news reporting has more or less disappeared and personal\nideology of the editor or a proprietor of the news channel often shapes\nthe news which has led the media to lose its credibility amongst people.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_11\">(c)     The prayers as made by the petitioners read as under :-\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_12\">          &quot;a.

This Public Interest Litigation dated August 31, 2020 is filed\nby Mr.Mahesh Narayan Singh &amp; Ors., who are stated to be retired senior\nofficers of the Indian Police Services (IPS) and who were once part of\nMumbai Police and the Maharashtra State Police. They claim to have\nheld prominent positions including posts like Director General of Police,\nAdditional Director General of Police, Commissioner of Police, etc. They\nhave retired after decades of distinguished and meritorious service and\nare public spirited and upstanding citizens of the country.             Their\npetition also arrays the UOI through its Secretary, Ministry of\nInformation and Broadcasting, the PCI, News Broadcasters Association,\nNews Broadcasting Standards Authority and the State of Maharashtra\nas the respondents. They contend that the actions of the media in their\nreportage as impugned, i.e, by use of derogatory and irresponsible\nlanguage against Mumbai Police and its Police Commissioner has\ntarnished the image and good name of the entire police force. Such\nreportage, according to them, has damaged the valuable reputation of\nMumbai Police. It is contended that these news reports label the\ninvestigation by Mumbai Police such as &quot;botched up investigation&quot;,\n&quot;tampering&quot;, &quot;nexus&quot;, &quot;olive branch extended to an accused by the Mumbai\nPolice&quot;, &quot;refused to file FIR&quot;, &quot;blot on the name of Mumbai Police&quot;,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                      22</span>\n                                                     Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\n&quot;shameful&quot;, &quot;wholly-owned subsidiary of *** (read the actress)&quot;, &quot;Mumbai\nPolice exposed&quot;, &quot;negligence&quot;, &quot;lost its credibility&quot;, &quot;shoddy investigation&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_13\">etc., which are highly derogatory, irresponsible and totally incorrect.\nAccording to the petitioners, after the decision of the Supreme Court in\nTransfer Petition (Criminal) No.225 of 2020, such reportage amounts to\na total misreporting of the facts by the media. The petitioners contend\nthat based on this false reporting, the media has gone to the extent of\ndemanding resignation of the Commissioner, Mumbai Police quite\noblivious of the observations made by the Supreme Court. This was\nnothing but the TV channels trying to influence the course of\ninvestigation being undertaken by the central agencies. It is contended\nthat such media trial, which has resulted into parallel investigation\nbeing undertaken by private individuals, amounts to gross violation of\nthe rights of the accused and the witnesses guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_13\">Articles\n14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_14\">21</a> of the Constitution, as right to a fair trial including a fair\ninvestigation is a Fundamental Right of an accused in the Indian\ncriminal justice system.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_14\">(b).        The petitioners say that media in our country enjoys\nextreme privileges; however, the same cannot be allowed to undermine\nthe authoritative investigation being undertaken by the authorities.\nThey contend that the right to freedom of speech and expression\nguaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_15\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> is not absolute and as <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_16\">Article 19(2)</a>\nordains, can be restricted by law, inter-alia, in the interests of public\norder, decency or morality or in relation to contempt of court,\ndefamation or incitement to an offence. They say that oblivious to this\nclear position in law, one of the prominent media house/ t.v. channel\nhas claimed that - &quot;...... It is in the pursuit of the truth the network has\ncarried out deep investigations, confronted key witnesses, accessed\ncrucial primary testimonies, stung multiple key individuals and exposed\nthe botch-ups of the Mumbai police and will continue to do so until the\ntruth emerges, in its entirety.&quot; It is submitted that such an action on the\npart of the electronic media is brazenly illegal, apart from being grossly\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                                    23</span>\n                                                   Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\nunfair and an irresponsible conduct on the part of the media house.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_15\">(c).

The petitioner, a society, has filed this writ petition dated\nSeptember 3, 2020 through its authorized signatory advocate Ms. Shirin\nMerchant. The respondents in this petition are the UOI, the PCI and the\nLaw Commission of India. This petition raising similar concerns as in\nthe earlier two petitions, however, raises an additional issue on the\ninterpretation of the provisions of section 3(2) of the CoC Act. It is\ncontended that this provision is required to be read down to mean that\nthe offending publication be held to be contemptuous as soon as an FIR\nis registered, for the reason that such publication is prejudicial to the\nprocedure and the imminent criminal proceedings contemplated under\nthe process of law which would ultimately culminate into a fair trial.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_25\">(b).        The petitioners say that the filing of this Public Interest\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                                     25</span>\n                                                     Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\nPetition was triggered because of the continuous reporting on the death\nof the actor by the electronic media. According to the petitioner, from the\nnature of the reportage, the sanctity of the State police machinery has\nbeen demolished and the public opinion was sought to be manipulated,\nagainst the &#x27;State law and order&#x27; machinery. This, according to the\npetitioner, has led to an inevitable ramification that the faith and\nconfidence of the citizens in the police machinery has been seriously\nimpaired by reckless media trial undertaken by the media channels. The\npetitioner says that this has led to a general belief that the State\nmachinery cannot be trusted and has completely shattered the credence\nand reliability the citizens are entitled to have in the local police\nmachinery.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_26\">(c).         It is contended that the constitutional protection under\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_18\">Article 21</a> protecting the right of an accused of a fair trial is in the\nnature of a valid restriction operating on the right of free speech under\n<a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_19\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> by the very force of the former being a constitutional\nprovision. According to the petitioner, the media has publicly tried and\nconvicted the alleged accused and has even proceeded to attribute a\nnumber of acts to the accused person(s) portraying the accused as a\nmurderer, abettor, a drug addict, etc. The media has in fact declared\nthat number of persons are involved in the suicide of the actor, alleging\nit to be murder case, inter-alia, on the basis of - (i) statement to the CBI\nof a potential witness (a house manager) has been put up in the media;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_27\">(ii) Whatsapp chats between potential witnesses have been broadcast;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_28\">(iii) death, rape, etc. threats to the alleged accused; (iv) reaction of\ninvestigation agency to the statements given by certain accused has\nbeen published in the media; (v) statements of hospital staff members\nreported/published in the media; (vi) the forensic specialist who carried\nout the autopsy on the body of the actor has also been interviewed on a\nnational TV channel; (vii) statements of investigating officers, and\npurported statements of certain witnesses have also been commented\nupon; (viii) IPS officers of Bihar Police have also appeared in TV debates\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                                      26</span>\n                                                    Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\non the said    issue; (ix) private chats of the alleged accused were also\npublished in media; and (x) abusing and tarnishing the reputation as\nwell as calling into question, the character of the accused/suspect for\nnot answering the questions posed by the media.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_29\">(d).          It is contended that such acts on the part of the electronic\nmedia would amount to a relentless intrusion in the private lives of the\nvictims and the witnesses. In addition to this, the reputation of the State\npolice was tarnished portraying it to be incompetent and complacent in\nscreening the concerned accused. Also, the potential witnesses have\nbeen exposed by identifying them, interviewing them and by bringing\nthem in the public eye, asking them to make statements on TV channels\nand terming their statements as confessions.             This crosses all\nboundaries of legitimacy, in as much as, according to the petitioner\nthese potential witnesses eventually when required by law to depose on\noath before a Court of competent jurisdiction, would be faced with a\ndilemma of sticking to their unverified public statements given to a\nreporter. This has brought about a situation that the witnesses would be\nin a peril of coming under pressure from both the accused as well as the\ninvestigating agency.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_30\">(e).          Referring to the 180th report of the Law Commission of\nIndia, the petitioner has contended that the said report has extensively\ndealt with the doctrine of media trial, and thereafter the Law\nCommission in its comprehensive 200th report on the subject, has also\ndealt with the CoC Act to recommend that such media trial would also\npostulate a criminal contempt when such acts of any media interfere or\nobstruct the administration of justice in any manner.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_31\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1379677\" id=\"span_18\">(f).          The petitioners have referred to the decision of the Supreme\nCourt in <a href=\"/doc/1379677/\" id=\"a_20\">Saibal Kumar Gupta vs. B.K. Sen</a>, reported in AIR 1961 SC\n633, in the context of parallel investigation at the hands of the media to\ncontend that the Supreme Court held that &quot;it would be mischievous for\na newspaper to systematically conduct an independent investigation into\na crime and to publish the results of such investigation, and that such\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                                     27</span>\n                                                     Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\ntrial by media must be prevented as it tends to adversely interfere with\nthe course of justice&quot;.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_32\">(g).        It is further contended that the issue of trial by media or\nprejudice to a fair trial on account of pre-trial publication is directly\nlinked with <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_21\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution as well as section 3 of the\nCoC Act. The issue is about balancing the freedom of speech and\nexpression on the one hand and undue interference with administration\nof justice within the framework of the CoC Act as permitted by <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_22\">Article\n19(2)</a> on the other.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_33\">(h).        The petitioners next contend that the provisions of section 3\nof the CoC Act restricts the freedom of speech and expression including\nthe freedom of the media to report, if any such publication obstructs the\ncourse of justice in connection with any civil or criminal proceeding\nwhich is pending. According to the petitioner, section 3(1) of the CoC Act\naffords protection, to the person, if the person who publishes has no\nreasonable grounds to believe that a proceeding is pending before a\ncourt of law.    The petitioner says that as per the present law, the\nstarting point of pendency of criminal proceedings is from the stage\nwhen the court actually gets involved on submission of a final report by\nthe investigating agency under <a href=\"/doc/1412034/\" id=\"a_23\">section 173</a> of the Cr.P.C. thereby\nmeaning that any publication prior to filing of such report is not\ncontempt.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_34\">(i).        The contention is that looking at the current scenario,\nwherein the media has indulged in holding a trial and has attempted to\nconvict suspects/accused and in the process has brought in the public\ndomain statements of witnesses, confessions, details of forensic reports,\nand all such things which would ordinarily be a matter forming part of\nthe investigation report to be dealt with by the Court while framing\ncharges, such reportage have seriously violated the constitutional rights\nof an accused to a fair trial. Reference has been made to the comment of\nthe Law Commission that while the law has given immunity under\nsection 3(2) of the CoC Act, if the publication is one which admittedly\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                                     28</span>\n                                                    Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\nobstructs the course of justice and only because such a publication has\nbeen made before the filing of charge-sheet, whether such procedure is\njust, fair, and equitable? It is, thus, contended that if such offending\npublication is made in respect of a person against whom an FIR is filed\nbut a challan has not yet been filed, nor has such a person been\narrested, the procedure as one strictly provided by section 3(2) of the\nCoC Act may not be a procedure which is fair, just and equitable and in\nfact would be arbitrary and may not stand the test of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_24\">Article 14.</a>\nAccording to the petitioner, it has become necessary and in the interest\nof justice, that the said provision in the CoC Act is required be read\ndown to deem that such publication be held to be contemptuous as soon\nas the FIR is registered against a person, since the persistent salacious\npublication may be prejudicial to the procedure and proceedings\ncontemplated under the &#x27;due process of law&#x27; terminating into a fair trial.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_35\">(j).         <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"203322\" id=\"span_21\">In support of the contention, the petitioner has referred to\nthe decision of the Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/203322/\" id=\"a_25\">A.K.

The genesis giving rise to these Public Interest Litigation is\ncommon. It arises from the unnatural death of the actor on June 14,\n2020 at Mumbai. The petitioners state that on June 18, 2020, Mumbai\nPolice registered an Accidental Death Report (ADR) and commenced\ninquiry under <a href=\"/doc/411677/\" id=\"a_32\">section 174</a> of the Cr.P.C. to ascertain the cause of death\nand also to determine whether the death was the result of such criminal\nact committed by some other persons. The final postmortem report\nsigned by a team of five doctors was received by Mumbai Police on June\n24, 2020. According to the postmortem report, &quot;No struggle marks or\nexternal injuries&quot; were found on the actor&#x27;s body. This report also\nmentioned the cause of death as &quot;asphyxia due to hanging&quot;. It is stated\nthat during the course of inquiry during June to August 2020,\nstatements of 56 persons were recorded and other evidence such as the\npostmortem report, forensic report, etc. were collected.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">6.           On June 20, 2020, a complaint was lodged against one of\nthe prominent news channels before the Secretary, Ministry of\nInformation and Broadcasting, seeking action for insensitive and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">                                      31</span>\n                                                     Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\ndisparaging comments against the Indian Army and the coverage of\ndeath of the actor, stated to be in defiance with the Programme Code. It\nis said that no action was taken against the media channel on the\npetitioner&#x27;s complaint.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">7.          It is stated that the father of the actor who is based in Patna,\nBihar filed a complaint registered as FIR No.214 of 2020 dated July 25,\n2020 at Rajeev Nagar Police Station, Patna under <a href=\"/doc/1599401/\" id=\"a_33\">sections 341</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1243353/\" id=\"a_34\">342</a>,\n<a href=\"/doc/839778/\" id=\"a_35\">380</a>, <a href=\"/doc/988620/\" id=\"a_36\">406</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1436241/\" id=\"a_37\">420</a>, <a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_38\">306</a>, <a href=\"/doc/180217/\" id=\"a_39\">506</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_40\">120B</a> of the Indian Penal Code (hereafter,\n&#x27;the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_41\">IPC</a>&#x27;, for short) against the actress, although he had not attempted\nto file a FIR in Mumbai.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">8.      The actress filed a petition before the Supreme Court [Transfer\nPetition (Criminal) No.225 of 2020] seeking transfer of FIR No.241 of\n2020 filed by the father of the actor at Patna to Mumbai Police. The\nactress also relied on her tweet seeking CBI investigation in the matter.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">9.           On August 5, 2020 at the hearing of the transfer petition\nbefore the Supreme Court, the Central Government informed the\nSupreme Court that it had handed over the probe into the case of death\nof the actor to the CBI. The CBI, accordingly, lodged FIR on August 6,\n2020.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">10.          In the transfer petition, certain important questions of law\nin regard to the power of the Supreme Court to transfer investigation\nunder <a href=\"/doc/664789/\" id=\"a_42\">section 406</a> of the Cr.P.C., whether the proceedings under <a href=\"/doc/411677/\" id=\"a_43\">section\n174</a> of the Cr.P.C. conducted by Mumbai Police to inquire into the\nunnatural death of the actor could be termed as investigation and\nwhether the jurisdiction of Patna Police to register an FIR and\ncommence investigation into the death that took place in Mumbai, fell\nfor consideration.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">11.          The Supreme Court decided the transfer petition by a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">                                    32</span>\n                                                   Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\njudgment and order dated August 19, 2020. In paragraph 30 of the\ndecision, the Court held that the Bihar Government was competent to\ngive consent for entrustment of investigation to the CBI and as such the\nongoing investigation by the CBI is held to be lawful. It is necessary to\nnote the relevant observations of the Supreme Court:-\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">           &quot;39. As noted earlier, as because both states\n           are making acrimonious allegations of political\n           interference against each other, the legitimacy of\n           the investigation has come under a cloud.\n           Accusing fingers are being pointed and people\n           have taken the liberty to put out their own\n           conjectures and theories. Such comments,\n           responsible to or otherwise, have led speculative\n           public discourse which have hogged media\n           limelight. These developments unfortunately\n           have the propensity to delay and misdirect the\n           investigation. In such situation, there is\n           reasonable apprehension of truth being a\n           casualty and justice becoming a victim.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">           40. The actor *** was a talented actor in the\n           Mumbai film world and died well before his full\n           potential could be realised. His family, friends\n           and admirers are keenly waiting the outcome of\n           the investigation so that all the speculations\n           floating around can be put to rest. Therefore a\n           fair, competent and impartial investigation is the\n           need of the hour. The expected outcome then\n           would be, a measure of justice for the\n           Complainant, who lost his only son. For the\n           petitioner too, it will be the desired justice as\n           she herself called for a CBI investigation. The\n           dissemination of the real facts through unbiased\n           investigation would certainly result in justice for\n           the innocents, who might be the target of\n           vilification campaign. Equally importantly, when\n           integrity and credibility of the investigation is\n           discernible, the trust, faith and confidence of\n           the common man in the judicial process will\n           resonate. When truth meets sunshine, justice\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">                                      33</span>\n                                                      Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\n            will not prevail on the living alone but after Life&#x27;s\n            fitful fever, now the departed will also sleep well.\n            Satyameva Jayate.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">            41. In such backdrop, to ensure public\n            confidence in the investigation and to do\n            complete justice in the matter, this Court\n            considers it appropriate to invoke the powers\n            conferred by <a href=\"/doc/500307/\" id=\"a_44\">Article 142</a> of the Constitution. As\n            a Court exercising lawful jurisdiction for the\n            assigned roster, no impediment is seen for\n            exercise of plenary power in the present matter.\n            Therefore while according approval for the\n            ongoing CBI investigation, if any other case is\n            registered on the death of the actor *** and the\n            surrounding circumstances of his unnatural\n            death, the CBI is directed to investigate the new\n            case as well. It is ordered accordingly.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_43\">The petitioners say that from June 14, 2020 several prominent media\nchannels have been literally conducting &#x27;media trials&#x27; and &#x27;parallel\ninvestigation&#x27; by conducting and broadcasting debates, rendering\nopinions, exposing the material witnesses, examining and cross-\nexamining the witnesses, chasing the officials of CBI who were\ninvestigating the case. The petitioners say that all such telecast and\nbroadcast are available in public domain. It is said that the prominent\nnews channels in their attempt to sensationalize the issues, have gone\nas far as displaying the CDR records which is a vital piece of evidence,\nthereby resulting in the several threat calls and messages sent to the\nalleged accused. As per the media reports in public domain, being the\nday when the accused in the FIR was summoned by the Enforcement\nDirectorate, the news channel uploaded a video in which the actor&#x27;s\ncontact details were clearly shown. The petitioners say that to scandalize\nand sensationalize the death of the actor, irresponsible reporting to\nimplicate one of the prominent ministers of the State of Maharashtra\nand have been making derogatory, false and distasteful remarks against\nseveral ministers. Several news channels have proceeded to convict the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">                                      34</span>\n                                                   Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\naccused named in the FIR and also were making insinuations against\nhigh-ranking officers of Mumbai Police and the Ministers of the State\nwithout even completion of the investigation in the matter. The news\nanchors and reporters were examining and cross-examining all the\nproposed witnesses exposing the probable evidence to the public which\ncould be examined only by the investigating agency or by the competent\ncourts during the course of trial.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_44\">12.         On August 28, 2020, the PCI also issued a tweet through its\nofficial twitter account that the coverage of the alleged suicide of the\nactor by many media outlets are in contravention of the norms of\njournalistic conduct framed by it and it issued an advisory reminding\nthe media to follow the norms of journalistic conduct.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_45\">13.         The petitioners say that media trials during the pre-trial\ninvestigation stage by reportage and exposure of key witnesses and\nevidence, clearly undermines the concept of free and fair trial. The\nfreedom of the media, especially of the TV channels, cannot be allowed\nto super stretch to a point where, by outpouring reprobate information,\nbegins to clog and cloud the pellucid comprehension of &#x27;facts/news&#x27; in\nthe people&#x27;s minds and impinges upon free and fair investigation. The\nactions of the media in sensationalizing the actor&#x27;s death is not only\nadversely impacting the ongoing investigation by the CBI, but was also\nin the teeth of the &#x27;doctrine of postponement&#x27; propounded by a\nConstitution Bench of the Supreme Court in the case of Sahara          India\nReal   Estate   Corporation    Ltd vs SEBI, reported in (2012) 10 SCC\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_46\">603.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_47\">14.         The petitioners say that the fundamental or moot question\nof law which arises for consideration of this Court would be as to\nwhether the media under the garb of reporting news, can serve their\nown opinions as facts/news. The petitioners contend that the basic\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">                                    35</span>\n                                                   Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\nfunction of media is to report news and facts as they come and the\nformulation of a new opinion on the same is within the complete and\nexclusive domain of the people. However, it is observed that media works\nto create or induce opinions by narrating and reporting opinionated and\ntailored facts as news, which is beyond the scope, power and privilege\naccorded to the proverbial fourth pillar and a blatant abuse and misuse\nthereof.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_48\">15.           The petitioners contend that such media coverage not only\nflouts and violates the mandate of the CTVN Act and the Rules\nthereunder, but it is also in contravention of the Code of Ethics and\nBroadcasting Standards Regulations. The further contention is that\nmajority of the media of this country is Corporate Media, not owned\nand/or controlled by the State/Government but by business houses\nwhich thrive upon and function upon the TRP-driven and ratings and\nviewership oriented &quot;business models&quot; to generate profits for themselves\nby attracting advertisements, sponsorships, investments, etc.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_49\">16.           The petitioners assert that media is plagued with the\naffliction of disproportionate reporting, which may be seen from the\nundue coverage given to inconsequential and mindless matters,\nunrelated to the greater good of the people of the country, as opposed to\nissues of national and international importance which the people are\ngrappling with such as the COVID 19 crisis, mass joblessness, economic\ndownfall, starvation, medical and healthcare structural problems,\nfarmers issues, domestic violence, etc. These are the issues which\nhardly ever get any substantial significant or considerable coverage in\ncomparison to the TV time given to the exaggerated and sensationalised\nnon-issues.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_50\">17.           The petitioners contend that it is definitely not in the\ndomain of the media to prove someone guilty, and there is no question of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">                                       36</span>\n                                                       Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\nguilt or innocence till the investigation and trial by competent\nauthorities is complete; however, it is apparent that the media is\nhellbent upon painting the accused persons named in the FIR as guilty\nand culpable, through relentless repetitive and reiterative rhetoric and\nemphasis. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1515299\" id=\"span_33\">In this context, the petitioners refer to the decision of the\nSupreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/1515299/\" id=\"a_45\">Sidhartha Vashist @ Manu Sharma vs. State (NCT\nof Delhi</a>), reported in (2010) 6 SCC 1, wherein the Supreme Court has\ncommented on the danger of serious risk of prejudice if the media\nexercises an unrestricted and unregulated freedom, and that trial by\nmedia does not hamper fair investigation by the investigating agency\nand more importantly does not prejudice the right of defence of the\naccused in any manner whatsoever. The Supreme Court also observed\nthat it will amount to a travesty of justice if either of this causes\nimpediments in the accepted judicious and fair investigation and trial. It\nis held that the freedom of speech protected under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_46\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the\nConstitution has to be carefully and cautiously used, so as to avoid\ninterference    with   the   administration   of   justice   and    leading    to\nundesirable results in matters sub judice before the courts.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_51\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"58440\" id=\"span_34\">18.

It was\nobserved that the media should perform the acts of journalism and not\nas a special agency for the court.

It\n              is also interfering in the course of investigation by\n              the police, CBI and other agencies, being the\n              agencies who have been conferred authority in law\n              to investigate any alleged crime. Both, the electronic\n              and the print media, have flagrantly violated the\n              Codes issued by the print and electronic news\n              watchdogs and thus are turning the crime reporting\n              into media trial by assuming the role of prosecutor,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">                                    38</span>\n                                                         Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\n      jury and the judge.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">(iv) It is submitted that the freedom of press must be\n      safeguarded at all costs and at the same time it\n      should not be allowed to be used to virtually\n      attempt to overthrow the authority of the State. It is\n      not permissible to have medial trial resulting into\n      parallel investigation being done by several private\n      individuals by expressing opinion, exposing material\n      witnesses as well as examining of witnesses and\n      divulging crucial pieces of evidence before the\n      investigating    agency          could   have   a     chance     to\n      examine them, seek corroboration and ascertain\n      correCTVN ess or otherwise of the same. This would\n      amount to serious impediment in the investigation\n      being carried out by the investigating agency. The\n      media reporting should be fair and responsible, with\n      necessary care and caution. It shall not fall foul of\n      <a href=\"/doc/1641007/\" id=\"a_49\">section 124A</a> of the IPC and/or <a href=\"/doc/42025/\" id=\"a_50\">section 3</a> of the\n      Police    (Incitement       of     Disaffection)     Act,    1922\n      (hereafter&quot;the 1922 Act&quot;, for short) and shall not be\n      with     an   intent   to    spread       and      induce    such\n      disaffection, lack of faith and hatred against the\n      State and its police department.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1347293\" id=\"span_38\">(v)   The media reporting is required to be responsible\n      keeping in mind the statutory restrictions placed\n      vide <a href=\"/doc/1271471/\" id=\"a_51\">section 3</a> of the Police-Forces (Restrictions of\n      Rights) Act, 1966, which restricts the right of the\n      police force in respect of freedom of speech. The\n      freedom of right of speech and expression of citizens\n      is curtailed to a limited extent in so far as it is used\n      to cause disaffection in reference not to all persons\n      as in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1641007/\" id=\"a_52\">section 124-A</a> of the IPC but to a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">                                39</span>\n                                               Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\n    limited and special class of persons, namely, the\n    members of the police force.

The only\n    difference is that <a href=\"/doc/1641007/\" id=\"a_56\">section 124-A</a> of the IPC speaks of\n    bringing    disaffection    in   general   towards     the\n    Government established by law whereas <a href=\"/doc/1840572/\" id=\"a_57\">section 3</a>\n    speaks     of   causing     disaffection   towards     the\n    Government amongst the members of the police\n    force. Thus, for the purpose of invoking the said\n    section, the contents of the articles should be such\n    so as to cause disaffection amongst the members of\n    the police force towards the Government established\n    by law in India or the same should have the effect of\n    inducing any member of the police force to withhold\n    his service or to commit a breach of discipline. Even\n    the explanation appended to the said section is\n    more or less pari materia with the explanation\n    appended to <a href=\"/doc/1641007/\" id=\"a_58\">section 124-A</a> of the IPC.            There is\n    hence a statutory restraint on any such kind of\n    media trial and        publicly ridiculing statements\n    conducing to public mischief, which falls foul of\n    <a href=\"/doc/1198526/\" id=\"a_59\">section 505</a> of the IPC. None of the acts of media\n    houses can interfere with the statutory functions of\n    any    investigating      authorities   responsible     for\n    investigation into any crime. The electronic media\n    is not permitted to use objectionable gestures\n    coupled with highly derogatory words to assault at\n    and to lower the dignity of public servants, which\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">                                  40</span>\n                                                   Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\n       may tend to deter them from discharge of their duty\n       responsibly.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1379677\" id=\"span_41\">(vii) As per section 2 of the CoC Act, a criminal contempt\n       is divided into three parts: (i) scandalising, (ii)\n       prejudicing     or   interfering     with   the    judicial\n       proceeding, and (iii) interference or obstruction in\n       the administration of justice. It is well settled that\n       prejudicial publication affects the people at large as\n       well as the mind of the judges and as a result affects\n       the rights of the accused thereby denying fair trial,\n       which would amount to contempt of Court. The\n       petitioners in support of this submission rely on the\n       decision of the Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/1379677/\" id=\"a_60\">Saibal Kumar\n       Gupta &amp; Ors.</a> (supra).</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">(viii) The media acts as an important pillar of democracy\n       and the news, reporting, comments, etc. ought to be\n       free and fair, beyond the influence of corporate or\n       political   interests.   Media     personnel   should     be\n       subjected to responsible and ethical reporting, and\n       shall not resort to derogatory, false and distasteful\n       remarks by spreading viral theme of sensationalism\n       to make the public lose its faith in the system and\n       the police. Serious allegations have been leveled by\n       the media on high ranking officers of Mumbai Police\n       in extreme distaste without any evidence which\n       would result in influencing the investigating officers,\n       who sometimes succumb to the pressure created by\n       popular opinion, which is the result of malicious\n       campaign.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1379677\" id=\"span_42\">(ix)   The effect of media trial is that if a judgment is\n       delivered against the verdict already passed by the\n       media, then questions relating to impartiality, bias\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">                               41</span>\n                                             Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\n      or possibility of corruption would be raised, which\n      may seriously prejudice the administration of the\n      criminal law process.

(supra).   It   is\n      contended that the effect of media trial was\n      witnessed on many occasions earlier wherein free\n      and fair trial/investigation has suffered due to\n      sensational reporting and media trial conducted of\n      the case. Some instances relied are in the cases of\n      K.M.

The credibility of media is based on the\n      unbiased and objective reporting, and responsibility\n      for the same needs to be fixed so as to ensure that\n      administration of justice is not undermined.</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_38\">(xi) Also, the right to be presumed innocent until proven\n      guilty is one of the most important concept of\n      criminal justice system in India.

It is stated that NBA has set up News\nBroadcasting Standards Authority (hereafter &quot;the NBSA&quot;, for short) to\nconsider complaints against or in respect of broadcasters insofar as\nthese relate to the content of any news and current affairs broadcast. It\nis stated that on August 13, 2020, the NBSA has also issued advisory\nwherein attention of news channels is drawn to specific guidelines\ncovering reportage dated February 10, 2020 which deals with the\nmanner in which media should report in case of a suicide. The affidavit\nfurther states that some complaints including the petitioners&#x27; complaint\ndated June 20, 2020 were received in the MI&amp;B against telecast of news\nreport relating to the demise of the actor by various TV channels.

On behalf of Respondent no.2 - Press Council of India (PCI),\nreply affidavit of T. Gou Khanjin, Under Secretary is filed in the petition\nfiled by Mr. Asim Suhas Sarode. The affidavit contains that the PCI is a\ncreature of the <a href=\"/doc/143018423/\" id=\"a_72\">Press Council of India Act, 1978</a> and serves as a\nwatchdog of the press, for the press and by the press.               It adjudicates\ncomplaint against and by the Press, inter alia, for violation of ethics and\nfreedom of Press.        In this context, a reference is made to powers\nconferred under <a href=\"/doc/941401/\" id=\"a_73\">Sections 13</a> and <a href=\"/doc/663765/\" id=\"a_74\">14</a> to the PCI Act to contend that the\nPCI has jurisdiction over the print media only and has powers to impose\nsuch punishments of warning admonishing or censuring the news\npapers, news agency, the editors, or the journalist or disapprove the\nconduct of the editor or the journalist, as the case may be. It is\ncontended that the PCI has framed &quot;Norms of journalistic Conduct&quot;,\nwherein specific provision has been made with regard to reporting on\nsuicide which prescribes that the newspapers and news agencies while\nreporting on suicide cases shall not; published stories about suicide\nprominently and unduly repeat such stories; used language which\nsensationalized or normalizes suicide, or presents it as a constructive\nsolution to problems; explicitly described the method used; provide\ndetails   about    the   site/location;        use   sensational   headlines;     use\nphotographs, video footage or social media links.             It is contended that\nbesides warning admonishing and censuring the news papers, the news\nagency, the editors of the journalists, the PCI under <a href=\"/doc/1046310/\" id=\"a_75\">Section 15 (4)</a> is\nempowered to make such observations, as it may think fit in any of its\ndecisions or reports, respecting the conduct of any authority, including\nGovernment.

It is stated that the PCI had received a complaint through\nemail dated 20th June 2020 alleging the print media and digital media\nhad created mockery on the death of the late actor. The PCI by its letter\ndated 24h June 2020 requested the complainant to file a specific\ncomplaint against the print media by complying with the mandatory\nrequirements as per the Press Council of India (Procedure of Inquiry)\nRegulations, 1979 within three weeks from the date of receipt of such\nletter failing which the complaint would be dismissed.         No specific\ncomplaint was filed.     The complainant was also informed that the\nelectronic media, internet, television channel, social media do not come\nunder the jurisdiction of PCI Act.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_66\">Counter affidavit on behalf of the News Broadcasters Association\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_67\">24.         Ms.Annie Joseph, Secretary General of the NBA has filed an\naffidavit. She states that NBA comprises of several important national\nand regional private television news and current affairs broadcasters\nwho are its members. It is stated that since the electronic media is a\npowerful medium of communication, one of the first initiatives of the\nNBA was to put in place a Code of Ethics and Broadcasting Standards\n(&quot;Code of Ethics&quot;) to be adopted and voluntarily followed by its member\nbroadcasters in April, 2008 so as to make this Code of Ethics effective\nand to enforce the same by providing to the aggrieved parties a remedy\nagainst breach by member-broadcasters.      NBA also framed the News\nBroadcasting Standards Regulations which contain the scheme for\nsetting up completely independent self-regulatory adjudicatory body,\nnamely, the NBSA to ensure compliance of the Code of Ethics. The\nRegulations as also various guidelines/ advisories issued by it are\nbinding on the members of the NBA.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_68\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"28052284\" id=\"span_54\">25.

This is in accordance with constitutional\nprinciples of freedom of speech and expression as also in consonance\nwith the rights and duties of media to raise issues of public concern and\ninterest.   This is also in harmony with the citizen&#x27;s right to know,\nparticularly about events relating to the investigation of the case or\ndelay in the investigation or soft-pedalling on investigations pertaining\nto the matters of public concern and importance.</span>\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_69\">26.          Referring to the words of Lord Shaw in the case of Scott vs.\nScott, reported in [1913] AC 417, it is contended that publicity is the\nvery soul of justice. It is the keenest spur to exertion and the surest of\nall guards against improbity. It keeps the judge himself while trying\nunder trial. The security of securities is publicity.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_70\">27.          Referring to the interim order dated September 3, 2020\npassed by this Court on these petitions, it is stated that already this\nCourt has urged the broadcasters to exercise restraint in its reporting of\nthe investigation of unnatural death of the actor which would in any\nmanner hamper or prejudice the on-going investigation being carried\nout by the CBI. It is stated that the members of the NBA have abided by\nthe said order and as far as possible tried to strike a balance between\nfree speech and privacy of individual.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_71\">28.          It is contended that for practicing self-regulation, it was\nimperative to lay down guidelines, procedural safeguards, define\neditorial principles consistent with the tenets of freedom of speech and\nexpression as articulated in the Constitution of India; the regulatory\nframework; common sensibilities of television viewers and establish a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_56\">                                       51</span>\n                                                         Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\nbody that would act as a watchdog and a grievance redressal forum for\nthe member broadcasters and viewers.

These guidelines were\napproved by the Delhi High Court. It is thus contended that this Court\nmay not pass any adverse order which would in any way directly or\nindirectly, affect or curtail the rights of the media.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_74\">Counter-affidavit on behalf of the Central Bureau of Investigation\n(CBI)\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_75\">31.

It was alleged that the actress developed intimacy with the\nactor and took control of his credit cards and bank accounts and\nmisappropriated the funds of the actor. It is stated that in furtherance\nof the said conspiracy, the actor was illegally restrained and confined, he\nwas threatened that he would be implicated in the suicide case of his\nsecretary, who died under mysterious circumstances in the intervening\nnight of June 08/09, 2020. The complaint also alleged that the actor\nwas made to believe that he was suffering from mental problem and was\nthreatened that if he fails to tow their line, his medical reports would be\nmade public, and thereby abetted him to finally commit suicide on June\n14, 2020.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_77\">33.           It is also stated that the Supreme Court of India by its\norder dated August 19, 2020 in *** vs. The State of Bihar &amp; Ors.,\nreported in TP(Cri.) No.225 of 2020 approved the investigation being\ncarried out by the CBI.

It is stated that the CBI has neither done any media briefing\nnor is there is any leakage of information on its part; however, it cannot\nprevent the electronic and print media from carrying and broadcasting\nnews items related to the case. It is contended that there is a huge\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_59\">                                     53</span>\n                                                     Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\nvolume of user generated content in various platforms of social media\nand the CBI cannot restrain the media from keeping track of the\nmovements of its team/officers/ witnesses/other persons of interest at\npublic places until and unless it amounts to interference in the\ninvestigation, given the right to Freedom of Speech and Expression as\nprovided in the Constitution of India.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_79\">35.         It is stated that on September 3, 2020, the CBI had released\na press statement in regard to its investigation being conducted in a\nsystematic and professional way and certain media reports attributed to\nthe CBI investigation are speculative and not based on facts. In this\ncontext it is contended that as a matter of policy, the CBI does not share\ndetails of ongoing investigation as also the CBI spokesperson or any\nteam member has not shared any details of investigation with the media\nand the details being reported and attributed to the CBI are not credible.\nIt was also requested that media may confirm details from the CBI\nspokesperson. It is stated that the CBI has not briefed the press after\nSeptember 3, 2020.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_80\">36.         It is next stated that the petitioners&#x27; claim that such\nreporting by the media is adversely impacting the ongoing investigation\nby the CBI cannot be supported and would create a negative impact of\nsuch news on the image and reputation of the CBI, in the eyes of public\nat large. It is stated that there is no denying the fact that such reporting\nresults in prejudicing the public at large. It is stated that the CBI is\ndoing its investigation in an objective manner wherein all facts and\nevidence related to the case are being meticulously scrutinized and\nwithout being influenced by any external factors. It is stated that the\ninvestigation carried out by the CBI is unhindered from such reporting\nby media. It is categorically stated that the CBI has not leaked any\ninformation related to the investigation of this case and the same has\nmaintained highest level of confidentiality and professionalism.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_60\">                                      54</span>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_81\">                                                   Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\n\nCounter-affidavit on behalf of T.V.

At the outset it is contended that the petitioner is seeking\nrelief of a postponement order which cannot be sought in a Public\nInterest petition as such relief can be sought by a person who is himself\naggrieved as held by the Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/118389240/\" id=\"a_89\">Sahara India Real Estate\nCorporation Limited</a> (supra).</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_83\">38.         It is contended that the actor&#x27;s case is not sub-judice and\nthis would be relevant in the context of sub-<a href=\"/doc/1840572/\" id=\"a_90\">section 3(2)</a> of the CoC. No\nchargesheet has been filed by the investigating authority nor any Court\nhas issued a summons/warrant against the accused. Hence no\nreporting on the said case can constitute contempt of court. The legal\nposition in India is unlike the position in England wherein a criminal\nproceeding is considered to be &quot;active&quot; or sub-judice when any &quot;initial\nstep&quot; is taken in the case including arrest without warrant. However, the\nCoC Act was enacted upon acceptance of the recommendations of the\nM.P. Bhargava Committee (i.e. Joint Parliamentary Committee, which\nsubmitted its report on February 23, 1970). The M.P. Bhargava\nCommittee has subsequently opined that the criminal case should only\nbe considered to be pending &quot;when the case actually comes before the\ncourt and it becomes seized of the matter.&quot;\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_84\">39.         Reference is made to the 200th Report of the Law\nCommission of India which recommended that the CoC Act be amended\nin order to bring it in line with the <a href=\"/doc/1396751/\" id=\"a_91\">Contempt of Court Act, 1981</a> in\nEngland. The said recommendations are yet to be accepted by the\nParliament. Consequently the actor&#x27;s case cannot be considered to be\nsub-judice as it stands presently.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_62\">                                      55</span>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_85\">                                                        Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_86\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"118389240\" id=\"span_63\">40.

It is contended that the petitioners have made vague\nallegations and they have not alleged any specific wrong doing on the\npart of the answering respondent. No particulars of any such\nobjectionable reporting are set out in the petition which would have the\ntendency to interfere with the administration of justice. It is contended\nthat the petition alleges some media organizations having implicated\nprominent personalities. If this be so, considering the law <a href=\"/doc/58440/\" id=\"a_97\">laid down by</a>\nthe Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/501107/\" id=\"a_98\">R.

It would be open for the person who is aggrieved\nto file criminal case for defamation. It is <a href=\"/doc/501107/\" id=\"a_99\">laid down by</a> the Supreme Court\nthat a statement against public official such as a Minister can only be\nconsidered as defamatory if it is made &quot;with reckless disregard for\ntruth.&quot; This is a question which would require a trial and cannot be\ndetermined in a Public Interest Litigation.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_90\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"110813550\" id=\"span_70\">43.

The Court held that it is only when\ndiscussion or advocacy reaches the level of incitement that <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_101\">Article 19(2)</a>\nis attracted.

In regard to the stand of this T.V. channel, it is stated that\nIndia Today group originally started its journalistic activities with\npublication of a magazine &quot;India Today&quot; way back in December 1975. It\nis stated that electronic media came up as an additional way for\nreaching out to the people with news and presentation of diverse views;\nhence, the India Today Group entered the field of electronic media. The\nIndia Today Group publishes magazine such as India Today, India\nToday Hindi, Business Today besides the Indian editions of leading\ninternational titles like Cosmopolitan, Harper&#x27;s Bazaar and Reader&#x27;s\nDigest and all these magazines command a leadership status in print\nmedia. In electronic media, the India Today Group has leading 24 x 7\nnews channels beginning with Aaj Tak which is a leading Hindi news\nchannel for the past two decades followed by India Today which is a\nleading English channel and also two other Hindi news channels, i.e.,\nTez and Aaj Tak HD and 3 radio channels in Delhi, Mumbai and\nKolkata. Both Aaj Tak and India Today created history in channels\nhaving positive impact on public opinion. The whole object of this news\nchannels has been to provoke thoughts, discussions and debates rather\nthan present any one-sided story.        Practice of fair reporting by these\nchannels has earned the group reputation in the field of journalism\nthroughout India and overseas and also amongst its peers. All reporting\neven on the concerns as raised by the petitioners, as far as this\nrespondent is concerned, are made in good faith and also are expression\nof free and frank view over a topic of debate at national level.

An omnibus order for gagging the\nmedia would cause harm to public interest rather than serving any\npublic interest. The provisions of the CTVN Act and the Rules framed\nthereunder provide for sufficient remedy to the aggrieved persons.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_94\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"223504\" id=\"span_74\">47.         It is next contended that <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_104\">Article 19</a> of the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights, as also <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_105\">Article 19</a> on Civil Political Rights\nduly recognized the freedom of press which is an integral part of freedom\nof speech and expression guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_106\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the\nConstitution.

It is next\ncontended that the apprehension of the petitioners is quite remote and\nconjectural and no direct nexus with any actual adverse effect has been\naverred by the petitioners.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"921638\" id=\"span_75\">Referring to the decision of the Supreme\nCourt in <a href=\"/doc/921638/\" id=\"a_108\">Union of India and Others vs. Association</a> for Democratic\nReforms, reported in AIR 2002 SC 2112, it is contended that although\none sided information, dis-information, mis-information and non-\ninformation equally create an uninformed citizenry which would make\ndemocracy a farce, however, to avoid such situations, right strategy\nwould be to strengthen the media rather than an attempt to bring undue\nrestraints on its rights. Hence, undue restraints imposed on the media\non the basis of one-sided beliefs of some persons claiming to espouse\ncause of public interest would harm larger public interest.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_95\">48.         It is contended that reporting in the news channels of this\nrespondent was fully compliant with the norms which are prescribed by\nthe NBSA. The petitioners have already sought to file complaint on June\n20, 2020 against the news channels. The present petition which is filed\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_76\">                                    59</span>\n                                                   Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\nfor omnibus reliefs is not maintainable and should be dismissed.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_96\">Counter affidavit on behalf of Times Now.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_97\">49.         At the outset, it is contended that the petition is not\nmaintainable under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_109\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution since there is no\nviolation of the fundamental rights or any legal right of the petitioners.\nThe petitioners are seeking enforcement of the provisions of the CTVN\nAct and the rules framed thereunder and the self-regulatory guidelines\nenforceable through the process of self- regulation. These reliefs are in\nthe nature of a pre-publication injunction, which is not permissible in\nlaw.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_98\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"261493\" id=\"span_77\">50.         It is stated that the petitioners, on their own accord, have\nconcluded that the reporting by the answering respondents is neither\nfair nor equitable, without referring to the reporting as a whole. It is\ncontended that whether such reporting is in violation of any provisions\nof law is a disputed question of fact and cannot be gone into under the\nguise of exercise of jurisdiction of this Court under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_110\">Article 226</a> of the\nConstitution.   Further this respondent &quot;is not even&quot; State or an\norganization under the control of the Government to bring it within the\npurview of <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_111\">Article 12</a> of the Constitution so as to be amendable to the\njurisdiction of this Court under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_112\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution. It is\nsettled that a writ will ordinarily lie only against the State or\ninstrumentality of the State. Reliance is placed on the case of <a href=\"/doc/261493/\" id=\"a_113\">Binny\nLtd. vs. Sadasivan</a>, reported in AIR 2005 SC 3202, wherein the\nSupreme Court has held that a writ will lie against a private body only\nwhen it performs public functions or discharges public duties. There is\nno averment in the petition that this respondent is performing any\npublic function. Thus, the respondent cannot be considered as a &#x27;State&#x27;\nwithin the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_114\">Article 12</a> of the Constitution.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_99\">51.         The petitioners have no locus whatsoever to raise an issue\nabout the on-going discussion on the death of the actor. The discussion\non the television has been conducted in public interest and to ensure\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_78\">                                     60</span>\n                                                     Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\nthat justice is met. It is stated that this petition must be seen in the\nlight of fact that the same has been filed by &#x27;busy body&#x27; petitioners who\nare neither involved in the issue that is debated upon as an accused or\nas a witness or is a victim of controversy. It is not a case where the\npetitioners&#x27; rights under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_115\">Article 21</a> are infringed by any means. The\npetition is therefore certainly not maintainable. It is contended that the\nSupreme    Court    has   already   passed   necessary     judgment/order,\nupholding the fact of transfer of all investigation relating to the death of\nthe actor to the CBI and in pursuance thereto this Court has also\npassed orders on September 3, 2020 and on September 10, 2020. Also\nthe NBSA has heard the matter in detail, and as such, is likely to pass\nnecessary orders; hence, the petition is infructuous to the extent that it\nseeks the authorities to act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_100\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"456839\" id=\"span_79\">52.         There is also no violation either constitutional, statutory or\nof the self-regulatory mechanism, as this respondent being a television\nchannel is involved in dissemination of the current affairs and news\nbeing a fundamental right of freedom of speech and expression\nguaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_116\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution of India, which\ncannot be curtailed, unless the restrictions as contained in <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_117\">Article 19(2)</a>\nof the Constitution are triggered following a lawful procedure. No case of\nviolation is made out against this respondent. There is no violation of\nany statutory provision by this respondent and/or of any self-regulatory\nguidelines. The respondent thereafter has referred to the rights of the\nmedia to disseminate information as recognised in several decisions.\nThis respondent has referred to the decision of the Supreme Court in\n<a href=\"/doc/456839/\" id=\"a_118\">Romesh Thapar vs. State of Madras</a>, reported in AIR 1950 SC 124 on\nthe importance of freedom of speech and expression both from the point\nof view of the liberty of the individual and from the point of view of our\ndemocratic form of government.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"243002\" id=\"span_80\">Also, a reference is made to the decision\nof the Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/243002/\" id=\"a_119\">Sakal Papers (P) Ltd. v. Union of India</a>,\nreported in AIR 1962 SC 305 to contend that the Constitution Bench of\nthe Supreme Court held that freedom of speech and expression of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_81\">                                     61</span>\n                                                       Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\nopinion is of paramount importance under a democratic Constitution\nwhich envisages changes in the composition of legislatures and\ngovernments and must be preserved.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"125596\" id=\"span_82\">A reference is also made to the\njudgment in <a href=\"/doc/125596/\" id=\"a_120\">Bennett Coleman &amp; Co. v. Union of India</a>, reported in\n(1972)2 SCC 788 to contend that the freedom of speech and of the press\nis the &#x27;ark of democracy&#x27; as public criticism is essential to the working of\nits institutions.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1327342\" id=\"span_83\">A reference is also made to the decision of the Supreme\nCourt in <a href=\"/doc/1327342/\" id=\"a_121\">S. Khushboo vs. Kanniammal &amp; Others</a>, reported in AIR 2010\nSC 3196, wherein it is held that the importance of freedom of speech\nand expression was necessary to tolerate unpopular views.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1205615\" id=\"span_84\">A reference\nis made to the decision of Delhi High Court in <a href=\"/doc/1205615/\" id=\"a_122\">Sushil Sharma vs. The\nState (Delhi Administration</a>), reported in 1996 Cri.

It is next contended that the telecast as undertaken by this\nrespondent was a bonafide reporting of a matter of public interest to\nwhich it was entitled to make. It is settled law that the press is entitled\nto make fair comments on issues that impact the public at large, which\nis the freedom of press, and a facet of the freedom of speech and\nexpression guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_123\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution. It is\nstated that the telecast and news reporting on the unfortunate demise of\nthe actor is a step taken by this respondent to unearth the truth and to\nbring it before the public at large. The right to know is a basic right\nwhich the citizen of a free country aspires in the horizon of the right to\nlive in this age in our land under the Constitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_102\">54.          It is contended that the postponement order as sought by\nthe petitioners are passed only in cases in which there is a substantial\nrisk to the fairness of the trial or for appropriate administration of\njustice, unlike what is ongoing in the present case. This respondent has\nnever posed any risk or interfered with the investigation undertaken by\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_85\">                                     62</span>\n                                                    Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\nthe three independent agencies namely the CBI, the ED and the NCB, all\nof which are conducting investigation in a matter that is best suited as\nper law. Hence the relief claimed in the present case and attempting to\nseek a restraint order is a complete mockery and travesty of justice\nbesides direct infringement of the fundamental rights of this respondent.\nThis, particularly when the actor was a public figure and public interest\nrequired that the public becomes aware of the happenings in the\ninvestigation. It is contended that it is settled law that the media and\npress should not be unnecessarily restricted in their speech as the same\nmay amount to curtailment of expression of the ideas and free\ndiscussion in the public on the basis of which a democratic country\nfunctions. Freedom of Expression and Democracy are the cornerstone of\nour Constitution. The intention of the Constitution framers was that a\nwell-informed citizenry would govern itself better. The reality of open and\nfree public discussion and debate was considered central to the\noperation of our democracy. Freedom of speech can be curtailed when it\nshall prejudice the administration of justice and the petitioners have\nfailed to show and/or establish as to what has been reported till date by\nthis respondent was in any manner prejudicial to the administration of\njustice. In this context, a reference is made by this respondent to a brief\nnote on Media &amp; Judicial Independence by Mr. Justice P.B. Sawant\n(retired) who has stated that no doubt media plays a very vital role in\npresent times, imedia has come to be known as the eyes and the ears of\nthe people. Over the years it has also become their brain and tongue.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_103\">55.         It is contended that the petitioners have also not explained,\nas to how, any of the answering respondent&#x27;s news telecasts was in\nviolation of the Code of Ethics and Broadcasting Standards of the NBA.\nVague averments have been made against a few media reports without\nany specifics and without in fact stating as to why and how a mere\ntelecast of live news reporting or news debates by the respondent could\nbe used to allege any violation of the Code. The petitioners cannot pray\nfor common and blanket order to be passed which would be an incorrect\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_86\">                                         63</span>\n                                                           Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\nposition in law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_104\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"671310\" id=\"span_87\">56.             It is contended that freedom of speech and expression not\nonly includes the right to freedom of press but it also includes the right\nto    acquire    information   and    consequently,    the     right   to   acquire\ninformation includes the right to access to the source of information as\nheld in <a href=\"/doc/671310/\" id=\"a_124\">Prabha Dutt vs. Union of India</a>, reported in (1982) 1 SCC 1.\nHence any attempt to deny such right to access to the source of\ninformation must be frowned upon unless it falls within the mischief of\n<a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_125\">Article 19(2)</a> of the Constitution.</span>\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_105\">57.             It is contended that the interpretation canvassed on behalf\nof the petitioners is also devoid of practicality especially in view of the\nprevalence of the electronic media and the internet. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"642425\" id=\"span_88\">In this context\nreference   is    made    to   the   decision   of   the    Supreme      Court     in\n<a href=\"/doc/642425/\" id=\"a_126\">Nakkheeragopal vs. State</a>, reported in 2001(4) CTC 423 to contend that\nwhile discussing the prohibition on exit polls during the 48 hours period\nprescribed under <a href=\"/doc/55081742/\" id=\"a_127\">section 126</a> of Representation of Peoples Act, the\nSupreme Court in paragraph 25 has laid down that (i) the right to access\nthe source of information is required to be read into the freedom of press\nprotected under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_128\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution, namely the freedom\nof speech and expression; (ii) no restrictions could be made to interfere\nwith the freedom of press, unless &#x27;law&#x27; specifically empowers the State or\nits officials to impose any restraint, either prior or post; (iii) even if any\nnorms or guidelines were to be enacted by the State, following due\nprocess of law, either on their own or on the suggestions of commission\nappointed for the said object, the same would be valid, only subject to\nthe satisfaction of <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_129\">Article 19(2)</a> of the Constitution; (iv) any restriction,\neven imposed by a law, under <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_130\">Article 19(2)</a> of the Constitution, the same\nshould not only be in the interest of public, but should also satisfy the\ntest of reasonableness; (v) the freedom of press is subject to the conduct\nof public officials in discharge of their official duties.</span>\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_89\">                                     64</span>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_106\">                                                    Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_107\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"110813550\" id=\"span_90\">58.         The respondent has next referred to the decision of the\nSupreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/110813550/\" id=\"a_131\">Shreya Singhal</a> (supra) and more particularly to the\nobservations of the Court in paragraphs 13 to 19, 24, 25, 38 to 41, 46\nand 47 to contend that the restriction on <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_132\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> are limited to\nthe one recognised by <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_133\">Article 19(2).</a> There is no concept of restriction in\npublic interest. That under the Constitutional scheme, it is not open to\nthe State to curtail freedom of speech and expression to promote the\ngeneral public interest.   This freedom is important, as we need to\ntolerate unpopular views. A fear of serious injury cannot justify\nsuppression of free speech and assembly; that there are three concepts\nwhich are fundamental in understanding the reach of this most basic\nhuman right. The first being discussion, the second being advocacy and\nthe third is incitement. Mere discussion or even advocacy of a particular\ncause howsoever unpopular is at the heart of <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_134\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> and it is\nonly when such discussion or advocacy reaches the level of incitement\nthat <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_135\">Article 19(2)</a> is attracted. It is thus contended that in the present\ncase, whether reporting as undertaken has reached that level of\nincitement is yet to be tested and is a disputed question of fact, which\ncannot be looked into. This, particularly when the content of the right\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_136\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> remains the same whatever the means of\ncommunication including internet communication and television news\nreporting. It is also necessary to consider as to whether the action\ncomplained of affects the masses or the individual, as any individual\nright must give way to the larger interest/right to know of the public\nguaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_137\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution. It is also material\nto consider as to whether the news reporting has the tendency to\npresent a clear and present danger or is it incitement to an offence.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_108\">59.         It is next contended that there is no violation of any\nstatutory provision and more particularly of the CTVN Act and the rules\nframed thereunder by this respondent. There is no violation of any of the\nprovision of the Programme Code in telecasting the news related to the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_91\">                                    65</span>\n                                                   Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\nactor&#x27;s death. It is then contended that this respondent has used its\nsources and aids in exercise of its journalistic rights, ethics and duties\nto unearth the intricacies involved in this case to inform the public at\nlarge. It is contended that no particular person has been targeted\nwithout any reason. The contents telecast in the news reports are\nbacked by reliable sources and corroborated with the progress of the\ninvestigations. Such investigative journalism resorted to by this\nrespondent cannot be alleged to be intended or calculated to influence or\naffect the ongoing investigations by the three independent investigating\nagencies. It is next contended that the telecast is required to be seen as\na whole. The formats of TV news debates are that an anchor or host\nbegins and moderates the show which focuses on a specific topic,\nusually a significant current newsworthy event and, the debate is\nopened for discussion, amongst the invitees/guests, who either speak\nfor or against the topic, and invariably some tend to take a neutral or\nextreme position. The debates are largely live, and it is not possible to\ncontrol the extreme views of the invitees/guests. It is thus necessary\nthat the entire discussion must be seen in that light. It is next\ncontended that there is no violation of any guidelines namely the alleged\nviolation of Code of Ethics and broadcasting standards or regulations.\nThe respondent has relied on the Norms of Journalistic Conduct issued\nby the PCI particularly Norm No.26 in regard to investigative journalism,\nwhich speaks about investigative journalism so as to include the\nfollowing two norms:- (a) That the investigative reporter should, as a\nrule, base his story on facts investigated, detected and verified by\nhimself and not on hearsay or on derivative evidence collected by a third\nparty, not checked up from direct, authentic sources by the reporter\nhimself; (b) There being a conflict between the factors which require\nopenness and those which necessitate secrecy, the investigative\njournalist should strike and maintain in his report a proper balance\nbetween openness on the one hand and secrecy on the other, placing the\npublic good above everything.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_92\">                                       66</span>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_109\">                                                     Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\n\nCounter affidavit of Republic TV\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_110\">60.         Affidavit   of   Shri.   Sivasubramanian     Sundaram,       Chief\nFinancial Officer, is placed on record. At the outset, it is contended that\nthe petition has been filed with ulterior motive and with an ultimate aid\nto curtail the freedom of press enshrined under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_138\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the\nConstitution of India, by seeking a relief of temporary postponement of\nnews reporting including telecasting, publishing reports/articles, and/or\ncarrying out discussions/debate in relation to the unfortunate, sudden\nand mysterious demise of the actor. It is contended that the petitioners\nunder the garb of the present petition is not only seeking gag order\nagainst all media houses from making any publication but also\nattempting to deprive the public of information in relation to suspicious\ndemise of the actor. The petition is thus an abuse of the process of law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_111\">61.         It is apprehended that the petitioners are directly or\nindirectly connected with the film industry and this is relevant in view of\nthe fact that various members of the film industry are being regularly\nprobed by the investigating agency in relation to the death of the actor.\nIt is contended that this respondent has reasonable apprehension that\nthe present petition has been filed not only to curtail the rights of the\npress but also with a malafide intention to safeguard the interest of such\npeople who apprehend disclosure] of their names due to the ongoing\ninvestigation in relation to the death of the actor. It is contended that\nlegitimate investigative journalism as carried out by this respondent as\nalso other media houses have brought in unexplored angles and exposed\nthe inconsistencies pertaining to death of the late actor.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_112\">62.         This respondent contends that this petition is nothing more\nbut a futile attempt to gag the media from reporting on the actor&#x27;s death\ncase. It is contended that it has been a long fight of more than forty-\nseven days of investigative journalism by the media who has unearthed\nthe pile of evidence in the case and put it before the people of India. It is\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_93\">                                        67</span>\n                                                     Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\ncontended that given the alleged mis-handling of crucial evidence right\nat the start of the case by the previous investigating agency and the\nquestions raised vis-a-vis the initial investigation, this respondent\nbelieves that it is the urgent duty of the media to contribute in the fight\nfor justice in the actor&#x27;s death case &quot;by contributing in uncovering the\ntruth&quot;. It is contended that in the seventy-four years old history of our\ndemocracy, there have been multiple instances of media having played\npivotal role in gathering evidence that poured into a massive campaign\nfor justice. The examples being Jessica Lal murder case, Nitish Katara\nmurder case, Rocky Yadav&#x27;s case among the plethora of others which\nare prime examples when the media came together with the people of\nIndia in the fight for justice to prevail.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_113\">63.          The affidavit narrates the facts brought in light by this\nrespondent in relation to the death of the actor which is stated to be the\nevidence of un-impeachable character in relation to the unfortunate\ndeath in question. This respondent alleges grave irregularities which had\ntaken place in the investigation. It is contended that such reporting has\nbrought into public domain the material facts and documents as also to\nthe notice of the investigating authorities. It is stated that this\nrespondent has carried out the investigative journalism in order to bring\ncorrect facts and truth to the larger public and highlighting material\nfacts which have been ignored while conducting inquiry by the previous\ninvestigating agency in relation to unnatural death of the actor.          The\naffidavit has also set out the instances as being stated to be pointed out\nto the Court which are instances from June 2020 till August 30, 2020.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_114\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"734756\" id=\"span_94\">64.          It is stated that Republic TV is a media house of repute in\nthe media fraternity and hence has a responsibility to provide\ncomprehensive and objective information to the public. It is stated that\nthis channel has published as also carried out discussions and debates\nin relation to the demise of the actor with the sole intention to unfurl the\ntruth to the public at large. It is stated that people have a right to be\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_95\">                                      68</span>\n                                                     Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\naware and be informed about events which relate to public figures.\nReferring to the decision of the Delhi High Court in <a href=\"/doc/734756/\" id=\"a_139\">Surya Prakash\nKhatri Vs. Madhu Trehan</a>, reported in 2001(92) DLT, it is contended\nthat a free and healthy press is indispensable to the functioning of a\ntrue democracy. The Court has recognized the right of public to be kept\ninformed about the current political, social, economic and other burning\ntopics and important issues of the day to enable them to consider and\nform broad opinion about the same and that the primary function of the\npress is to provide comprehensive information of all such aspects. It has\nan educative and mobilising role to play and plays an important role in\nmoulding the public opinion and can be an instrument of social change.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_115\">65.         The affidavit then refers to the norms of investigative\njournalism and comments on the journalistic conduct published by the\nPCI (Edition 2010), according to which the basic element of investigative\njournalism would be that it has to be the work of the reporter, not of\nothers he is reporting; the subject should be of public importance for the\nreader to know; and an attempt is being made to hide the truth from the\npeople. It is stated that although the norms of Journalistic Conduct\npublished by the PCI are not binding on this respondent, as the PCI has\na recommendatory role and not a binding role; however, this respondent\nhas maintained, in keeping with the essence of high standards of\njournalistic conduct, such conduct while publishing information in\nregard to the said incident. It is stated that time is testimony of the fact.\nIt is next contended that investigative journalism has unearthed matters\nof grave concern and interest to the society at large. The Court has time\nand again recognized the legitimacy of instances of investigative\njournalism which have played an important role to reveal the issue\nwhich pertains to larger cause and serve public interest. In paragraph\n23 of the affidavit, the instances wherein the investigative journalism of\nthe respondent has aided the investigating agency to a large extent in\nthe interest of public is set out, which are the instances of the Sunanda\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_96\">                                      69</span>\n                                                     Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\nPushkar case, the Sheena Bora murder case and the role played by\nthem in breaking the Commonwealth Games scam, the &#x27;Kargil for\nprofit&#x27;scam, the Devas-ISRO scam, the Aircel Maxis deal, and the Lalit\nGate scandal among others. It is stated that it is in the interest of justice\nand persistence of the truth that the respondent should be allowed to\ncontinue this method of investigative journalism in order to aid the law\nand order machinery in the case while keeping the public duly informed.\nIt is next contended that investigative journalism by the media is in\naccord with the principles of freedom of speech and expression as\nenshrined under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_140\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution and is in\nconsonance with the basic and fundamental right and duty of the media\nto raise and discuss issues of public concern and interest.            In this\ncontext, reference is made to the decision of the Delhi High Court in the\ncase &#x27;Court on its own motion (supra), wherein the Court has made\nobservations emphasizing the importance of investigative journalism.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_116\">66.         It is next contended that the petitioners are trying to\nobstruct the cause of investigative journalism and are also attempting to\ndeprive the masses of its right to information about current affairs. The\npetition is therefore required to be dismissed failing which it would have\ngrave and wide ramifications and would serve as a death-knell for the\nfreedom of speech/press enshrined under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_141\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the\nConstitution.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_117\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"223504\" id=\"span_97\">67.         The affidavit comments on freedom of press and rights of\nmedia to state that in the preamble to the Constitution of India, liberty\nof thought and expression of citizens has been secured. It is stated that\nthe Constitution affirms the right to freedom of expression, which\nincludes the right to voice one&#x27;s opinion. It is stated that the freedom of\npress is regarded as a &#x27;specie&#x27; of which freedom of expression is a\n&#x27;genus&#x27;.   Referring to the decision of the Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/223504/\" id=\"a_142\">Indian\nExpress Newspapers (Bombay) Pvt.

It is contended that in the petition there is no case made out for\ncurtailment of right of freedom of speech and expression.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_118\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"456839\" id=\"span_99\">68.         A reference is also made to the decision of the Supreme\nCourt in <a href=\"/doc/456839/\" id=\"a_143\">Romesh Thapar</a> (supra), to contend that the freedom lies at\nthe foundation of all democratic organizations, for without free political\ndiscussion, there can be no public education which is quintessential to\nthe proper functioning of the democracy.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"158657439\" id=\"span_100\">The decision of the Delhi High\nCourt in <a href=\"/doc/158657439/\" id=\"a_144\">Shashi Tharoor Vs.

As to what would be &quot;the Chilling Effect of the Media&quot;, the\ndecision of the Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/1327342/\" id=\"a_145\">S.Khushboo</a> (supra), is relied to\ncontend that any blanket ban or gag order in the form of injunction\nrestraining the broadcast of true facts will impinge upon the people&#x27;s\nright to know and will have a chilling effect on the right to free speech of\nthe media.</span> The respondents also rely on the decision of the Supreme\nCourt in Shreya Singhal vs. Union of India (UOI), reported in AIR 2015\nSC 1523 to submit that virtually any view expressed on any matter may\ncause annoyance, inconvenience or may be grossly offensive to someone;\nhowever, this does not justify curtailing the liberty to express such\nopinions, nevertheless by causing a total chilling effect on free speech. It\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_102\">                                     71</span>\n                                                    Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\nis further contended that it is right of this respondent to provide public\nwith access to true and correct facts by undertaking the journalistic\nright to inform. It is contended that not only in the fitness of things but\na necessary concomitant of democratic functioning, that the lives of\npublic figures is subjected to scrutiny. As the public have the right to\ninformation in relation to public figures, this respondent being a\nresponsible media house deemed it reasonable and essential to raise\nquestion concerning the peculiar circumstances around the unfortunate\ndemise of the actor. This respondent has highlighted the obvious\nquestions that remained and continue to remain unanswered in relation\nto the death of the actor. It is thus contended that it is obviously in\npublic interest, that the role of Indian media is to expose the malaise\nwhich plagues the Indian system in different spheres, thereby stalling\nthe progress as expected in a country which adheres to the rule of law\nand the highest standards of criminal jurisprudence. Thus, the right to\nfreedom of speech cannot be curtailed merely on the basis of bald\nallegations and vague aspersions of a media trial and of creating false\nsensationalism as alleged in the petitions. A reference is made to the\ndecision of a learned Single Judge of this Court in Sunil Baghel &amp; Ors.\nvs. State of Maharashtra and Ors. (Cri. WP No.5434 of 2017) to\nsupport this contention.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_120\">70.         It is next contended that right of public to access true and\ncorrect facts is required to be recognized. This ensures overall fairness\nin the functioning of the justice delivery system which is achieved by\npublishing reports and carrying out discussions and debates providing\nthe public access to facts which was being undertaken by this\nrespondent concerning the unnatural death of the actor. The right to\npublic access also emanates from <a href=\"/doc/1134316/\" id=\"a_146\">section 327</a> of the Cr.P.C. which\nreaffirms the principle of&quot;open trial&quot;and access of public towards such\nopen trials or criminal trials. This achieves public confidence in the\nadministration of justice. It is contended that discussions and debates\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_103\">                                    72</span>\n                                                     Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\nare required to be conducted openly, fairly and fearlessly to ensure that\nmachinery like the police and other public servants are not being\nmisused. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"667073\" id=\"span_104\">In this context, a reference is made to the decision of the\nSupreme    Court    in   <a href=\"/doc/667073/\" id=\"a_147\">Kehar   Singh    &amp;   Ors.     vs.    Delhi     (State\nAdministration</a>), reported in 1988 AIR 1883.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_121\">71.         It is next contended that all the publications and media\ndebates as undertaken by this respondent are in consonance with the\nprovisions contained in the CTVN Act and CTVN Rules including the\nProgramme Code prescribed therein and do not violate the same as\nalleged by the petitioners. This respondent practices ethical journalism\nvery seriously. This respondent is not a member of the NBA-respondent\nno. 3. Hence, the Code of Ethics and broadcasting standards issued by\nthe NBA does not apply to this respondent. It is contended that the\nreporting in relation to the demise of the actor and bringing about\nmaterial facts pertaining to the same in the public eye should not be\nconsidered as violation of the provisions of the CTVN Act and Rules,\ninasmuch as the same has been done within the domain of legitimate\ninvestigative journalism and with the sole objective of bringing the truth\nout in the open.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_122\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"118389240\" id=\"span_105\">72.         It is next contended that the petition is not maintainable\nand is liable to be dismissed, as the petitioners have no locus standi to\nseek preventive relief of temporary postponement of news reporting, as\nthe petitioners are neither the accused persons nor the aggrieved\npersons whose right to fair trial has been allegedly curtailed in any\nmanner by the publication made by this respondent.

This respondent has contended that the petition is per se\nnot maintainable against the respondent inasmuch as the petitioners\nhave not shown any material to substantiate their allegations that this\nrespondent has been involved in reporting/conducting a media trial or a\nparallel investigation which has been involved in reporting/conducting a\n&#x27;Media Trial&#x27;/&#x27;Parallel Investigation&#x27; which directly or indirectly hampers\nthe investigation into the FIR in question registered by the CBI on\nAugust 6, 2020 in relation to the unnatural death of the actor. This\nrespondent has not reported, published or telecast in the nature of\ndebates or discussion any material which could tantamount to &quot;Media\nTrial&quot;/ &quot;Parallel Investigation&quot;. Neither it has examined or cross\nexamined any witnesses or has interfered in the investigation process.\nThe petition is also not maintainable, as the petitioners have an\nalternate efficacious remedy of filing a complaint before the NBSA, which\nhas the power to appropriately deal with its members like this\nrespondent in case of violation of its code of conduct. Also, the\npetitioners have no locus standi to seek the relief of temporary\npostponement of news reporting in any manner, as the petitioners are\nneither the accused persons nor the aggrieved persons whose right to\nfair trial has been curtailed in any manner.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_125\">74.         Also, there is no violation of the Programme Code, as <a href=\"/doc/118389240/\" id=\"a_149\">laid\ndown in</a> the CTVN Act and the Rules. This respondent in fact has\nengaged itself in legitimate and lawful investigative journalism without\nmaking any attempt to interfere with the ongoing investigation by the\nCBI. Any blanket ban or gag order in the form of injunction restraining\nthe broadcast of true facts will encroach upon the people&#x27;s right to know\nand violates the right to free speech. This will have a devastating and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_107\">                                              74</span>\n                                                                 Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\ndetrimental effect on the functioning of news channel.

It is stated that the ED neither entertains media in\ncourse of any investigation nor indulges into leaking any information to\nthem. It is stated that confidentiality in any ongoing investigation is an\nestablished parameter being practiced in the ED. ED maintains\nmaximum secrecy and confidentiality with regard to its investigations\nand none of the confidential details pertaining to the investigation of this\ncase have been leaked by ED in any manner whatsoever is what is\ncontended.

It is contended that the PCI is a statutory\nautonomous body which has been set up under the PCI Act to maintain\nand improve the standards of newspapers and news agencies, i.e., print\nmedia in India and also to inculcate principles of self-regulation among\nthe press. In furtherance of the objectives of the PCI, &#x27;Norms of\nJournalistic Conduct&#x27; have been framed under section 13(2)(b) of the PCI\nAct which cover the principles and ethics regarding journalism, viz.\naccuracy and fairness, pre-publication verification, caution against\ndefamatory writings, trial by media etc. and the print media is expected\nto adhere to the said norms. Also, an advisory was issued on August\n28, 2020 by the PCI referring to the alleged suicide by the actor to the\nmedia to adhere to norms framed by the PCI.

It is stated that in regard to the electronic media, as per\nexisting regulatory framework, the content telecast on private satellite\nTV channels is regulated in accordance with the CTVN Act and the Rules\nframed thereunder. It is stated that section 5 of the CTVN Act provides\nthat &#x27;No person shall transmit or re-transmit through a cable service any\nprogramme, unless such programme is in conformity with the\nprescribed programme code&quot;. The Programme Code, prescribed under\nrule 6 of the CTVN Rules, contains the whole range of parameters\ngoverning telecast of programmes on private satellite/cable TV channels.\nIt is stated that section 19 of the CTVN Act provides that where any\nauthorized officer thinks it necessary or expedient to do so in the public\ninterest, he may, by order, prohibit any cable operator from transmitting\nor re-transmitting any programme or channel, if it is not in conformity\nwith the prescribed Programme Code referred to in <a href=\"/doc/1052372/\" id=\"a_150\">section 5</a> and\nAdvertisement Code referred to in <a href=\"/doc/719602/\" id=\"a_151\">section 6</a>, or if it is likely to promote,\non grounds of religion, race, language, caste or community or any other\nground whatsoever, disharmony or feelings or enmity, hatred or ill-will\nbetween different religious, racial, linguistic or regional groups or castes\nor communities or which is likely to disturb the public tranquility. It is\nstated that sub-section (2) of section 20 of the CTVN Act makes a\nprovision that where the Central Government thinks it necessary or\nexpedient so to do in the interest of the (i) sovereignty or integrity of\nIndia; or (ii) security of India; or (iii) friendly relations of India with any\nforeign State; or (iv) public order, decency or morality, it may, by order,\nregulate or prohibit the transmission or re-transmission of any channel\nof programme; sub-section (3) of section 20 of the CTVN Act provides\nthat where the Central Government considers that any programme of\nany channel is not in conformity with the prescribed Programme Code\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_110\">                                     77</span>\n                                                   Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\nreferred to in <a href=\"/doc/1052372/\" id=\"a_152\">section 5</a> or the prescribed Advertisement Code referred to\nin <a href=\"/doc/719602/\" id=\"a_153\">section 6</a>, it may by order regulate or prohibit the transmission or re-\ntransmission of such programme. It is stated that the Government of\nIndia has also notified guidelines for up-linking and down-linking of TV\nchannels in India for grant of permission for up-linking/down-linking\nprivate satellite TV channels. As per para 5.2 of the guidelines for up-\nlinking from India, one of the basic conditions/obligations of the\ncompany permitted to up-link registered channels is that the company\nshall comply with the Programme Code and the Advertising Code\nprescribed under the CTVN Act and the Rules framed thereunder.\nFurther down-linking guidelines also carry similar stipulations under\npara 5.1 thereof. It is thus stated that the permission granted to any\nprivate satellite TV channel operating company, under the guidelines\nalso binds the company to comply with the Programme Code.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_133\">79.          It is stated that the up-linking and down-linking guidelines\nhave also made provisions for penalties. It is stated that as per para 8.1\nof the said guidelines, in case a channel has been found to have been\nused   for    transmitting   any   objectionable/unauthorized       content\ninconsistent with public interest, the Central Government has the\npower, inter-alia, to revoke the permission granted. Also, as per para 8.2\nof the up-linking guidelines, Central Government has the power to\nimpose penalties for violation of any of the terms and conditions or other\nprovisions of the said guidelines as set out in paragraph 8.2.1 and 8.2.3.\nIt is stated in paragraph 8.2.1 that in the event of first violation,\nsuspension of the permission of the company and prohibition of\nbroadcast/transmission up to a period of 30 days is provided for. In the\nevent of second violation, suspension of the permission of the company\nand prohibition of broadcast up to a period of 90 days is provided for\nand paragraph 8.2.3 provides, in the event of third violation, for\nrevocation of the permission of the company and prohibition of\nbroadcast up to the remaining period of permission. It is stated that\nsimilar provisions have been made in the down-linking guidelines as\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_111\">                                     78</span>\n                                                      Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\ncontained in paragraphs 6.2.1, 6.2.2. and 6.2.3.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_134\">80.           The affidavit further states that MI&amp;B has also set up\nElectronic Media Monitoring Centre (EMMC) to monitor the content of\nprivate satellite TV channels with reference to the violation of the\nProgramme and Advertising Codes. Further the MI&amp;B has also issued\ndirections to States to set up State Level and District Level Monitoring\nCommittees (DLMC) to regulate content telecast on cable TV channels.\nThe Committee takes a decision on the complaints received by it. The\nDLMC provides a forum where the public may lodge a complaint\nregarding content aired over any television distribution platform (cable,\nDTH, HITS or IPTV), private FM Channels and Community Radio\nStations operating in the District and act on the same as per the\nprocedure prescribed in the Office Memorandum dated April 26, 2017.\nThe mandate of the DLMCs includes keeping a watch on the content\ncarried by Television Distribution Platform Operator at local level and\nensuring that it is in conformity with the prescribed Programme and\nAdvertising Codes and to also ensure through authorized officers that no\nun-authorized channels are carried and local content that is aired is\npresented in balanced and impartial way and not in a a manner which is\nto offend or incite any community. It is further stated that so far in 19\nStates and 5 Union Territories, SLMCs have been set up. Also, DLMCs\nhave been constituted in 329 Districts.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_135\">81.           The affidavit further states that the MI&amp;B has also\nconstituted    an   Inter-Ministerial     Committee     (IMC)     under      the\nChairmanship of the Additional Secretary (I&amp;B) and comprising of\nofficers drawn from various Ministries of Central Government i.e.\nMinistry of Home Affairs, Defence, Women &amp; Child Development, Health\n&amp; Family Welfare, External Affairs, Law &amp; Justice, Consumer Affairs and\na member from the industry is a representative from Advertising\nStandards Council of India (ASCI), to look into specific complaints\nregarding violation of the Programme Code, as defined in Rule 6 of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_112\">                                     79</span>\n                                                    Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\nCable Television Networks Rules, 1994. The IMC accords focused and\ncareful attention to the cases of violation of Programme Code and makes\nappropriate recommendations to the MI&amp;B. A copy of order for\nconstitution of IMC is also placed on record. It is stated that appropriate\naction is taken against TV channels in case any violation of the\nProgramme Code is established. It is stated that action against TV\nchannels may extend from issue of warnings or advisories to comply\nwith the Programme Codes or directing channels to run apology scrolls\non their channels and can extend up to taking the channels off-air\ntemporarily for varying periods depending on the gravity of the violation.\nThe affidavit also sets out the details of action taken against authorized\nprivate TV channels for violation of Programme and Advertising Codes\nduring the period of 2015 - 2020. A tabular statement in the affidavit\nshows that about 173 actions which are in the nature of advisories,\nspecific channels, common warning orders for apology scrolls have\nbeen made of which about 18 are &quot;Off-air Orders&quot;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_136\">82.         The affidavit further states that apart from the above\nregulatory framework, Government has encouraged self-regulation in\nbroadcasting industry. The      affidavit   sets out the     self-regulatory\nmechanism established by industry bodies which deal with complaints\nabout programmes and advertisements on TV channels viz. (i) NBA,\nrepresentative body of news and current affairs TV channels, has set up\nthe NBSA headed by retired Judge of the Supreme Court/High Court, to\nconsider complaints against or in respect of broadcasters relating to\ncontent of any news and current affairs telecast on TV channels; (ii) The\nIndian Broadcasting Foundation (IBF), representative body of non-news\nand current affairs TV channels, has set up a Broadcasting Content\nComplaints Council (BCCC) headed by a retired Supreme Court/High\nCourt Judge to examine the complaints relating to the content of\ntelevision programmes; (iii) Advertising Standards Council of India\n(ASCI), established in 1985, has set up Consumer Complaints Council\n(CCC) to consider the complaints in respect of advertisements.              In\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_113\">                                    80</span>\n                                                   Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\nconclusion, the affidavit avers that in regard to the content violation in\nthe print and electronic media, the petitioner may approach the\nappropriate forum as per details as set out in the affidavit and that\nthese forums can take necessary action on the representation in\naccordance with the existing guidelines/rules/ regulations. Hence,\naccording to the deponent, no case is made out against the Government\nof India and the petition needs to be dismissed qua the respondent.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_137\">Counter affidavit of respondent no. 14-ABP News\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_138\">83.         At the outset, it is contended that this respondent has been\narrayed to enable the Court to address the issues raised in the PIL\npetitions effectively as observed in the order dated September 10, 2020.\nIt is contended that there are no allegations against this respondent.\nThis respondent has, throughout the course of reporting of the case on\nthe surrounding circumstances of the death of the actor, abided by\nethics of journalism, broadcasting standards and professional conduct\nas expected and required under the CTVN Act and Rules and the News\nBroadcasters Standard Regulations and the applicable laws and\nregulations. This petition is only an attempt to gag and block the entire\nmedia from reporting true and relevant facts on the mysterious\ncircumstances surrounding the death of the actor only because of the\nmanner and mode in which certain news channels are covering the said\ncase disregarding the ethics of journalism, engaging into media trials. It\nis in fact the prime duty of the media to provide information at large and\nhighlight true and correct facts. Both the judiciary and the media are\nengaged in the similar task, i.e., to discover the truth, to uphold the\ndemocratic values and to deal with social, political and economic\nproblems. The media has been called the handmaiden of justice, the\nwatchdog of society and the judiciary, the dispenser of justice and the\ncatalyst for social reforms. Hence, it is the utmost responsibility of all\nthe media houses, news channels and press to report in a responsible\nmanner. It is contended that because of the chaotic reporting and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_114\">                                     81</span>\n                                                     Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\ndemeanor of certain news channels, the other media houses should not\nand cannot be put under any adverse blanket orders. <a href=\"/doc/1142233/\" id=\"a_154\">Article 19(1)</a> of the\nConstitution   guarantees    the   Right   to   Freedom   of   Speech      and\nExpression, i.e., right to hold opinions without any interference in all\nforms. The Freedom of Press in India, although like the United States of\nAmerica is not a separate guaranteed right, it is still covered and is given\nthe status of freedom under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_155\">Article 19</a> by the Supreme Court of India.\nThere is already a framework of law under the CTVN Act and the Rules,\nthe PCI Act and the Self-Regulations as adopted under the auspice of\nthe NBA to look into any complaints against the electronic media. It\nwould be the jurisdiction of the NBSA to adjudicate all issues as against\nmembers of the NBA and the NBSA should be given recognition as a\nstatutory body to bring adjudications against all media houses under\none umbrella. It is, accordingly, submitted that no adverse orders be\npassed against this respondent.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_139\">Counter affidavit on behalf of the India TV\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_140\">84.         The contention, at the threshold, is that the Writ Petition\ndoes not contain any specific allegation against the respondent no.15\nand it is for this reason that this respondent was not impleaded as a\nparty by the petitioner.    However, subsequently in view of the order\ndated September 10, 2020, this respondent has been arrayed as one of\nthe parties to the present proceedings and hence this respondent be\ndropped from the proceedings. It is contended that the public interest\nlies in the public being well informed and made aware of important news\nand events. This petition is not a bonafide petition but has been filed for\ngrabbing the public&#x27;s attention and somehow stop the reporting of the\nnews and events pertaining to the Bollywood links to the events\nmentioned in the petition thereby having a chilling effect on the media.\nThe media is the fourth pillar of the democracy and it is the duty of this\npillar of democracy to keep all other authorities within the constitutional\nbounds. It is for this reason that the Freedom of Press has been secured\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_115\">                                     82</span>\n                                                    Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\nand protected as a Fundamental Right under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_156\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the\nConstitution.   The rights guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_157\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> are only\nsubservient to <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_158\">Article 19(2)</a> of the Constitution. Hence under the\nconstitutional scheme, the right under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_159\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> can only be\nreasonably restricted by law made by the State for the reasons specified\nunder <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_160\">Article 19(2).</a> Thus, by virtue of this petition, the right guaranteed\nto the media channel cannot be throttled and would not be permissible\nin law and any such curtailment would strike at the heart of the\nConstitution thereby hitting the basic structure of the Constitution. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1475436\" id=\"span_116\">In\nthis context, a reference is made to the decision of the Supreme Court in\n<a href=\"/doc/1475436/\" id=\"a_161\">Virendra vs. The State of Punjab</a>, reported in AIR 1957 SC 896,\nwherein the Supreme Court has observed that :</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_42\">            &quot;It is certainly a serious encroachment on the\n            valuable and cherished right of freedom of\n            speech and expression if a newspaper is\n            prevented from publishing its own or the view of\n            its correspondents relating to or concerning\n            what may be the burning topic of the day.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_141\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1475436\" id=\"span_117\">85.         It is thus contended that the &quot;content regulation&quot; cannot be\ndone by any public authority; however, as a responsible news channel\nalong with other like-minded news channels, the respondent has itself\nsubmitted to the Regulations of the NBSA and the guidelines as <a href=\"/doc/1475436/\" id=\"a_162\">laid\ndown by</a> this body. NBSA has an appropriate mechanism to entertain\ncomplaints of any violation of the standard and code as prescribed by it\nand is also authorized to impose appropriate penalties as prescribed.\nNBSA also recommends to the MI&amp;B to cancel the licence of news\nbroadcasters in case of serious violation of any of the standards/code as\nprescribed. It is contended that the NBSA has already heard various\nnews broadcasters including this respondent on the issue of news\ncoverage of the death of the actor and has reserved its order. The\npetition, therefore, is required to be relegated to the NBSA being the\ncorrect forum.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"118389240\" id=\"span_118\">This respondent has also raised an objection to the\nmaintainability of this petition similar to the one as raised by the other\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_119\">                                        83</span>\n                                                      Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\nrespondents - TV channels on the ground that the petitioners are not\naggrieved persons as explained by the Supreme Court in the decision\n<a href=\"/doc/118389240/\" id=\"a_163\">Sahara India Real Estate Corporation Ltd.</a> (supra).</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_142\">Counter affidavit on behalf of respondent no. 16 - News Nation\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_143\">86.         At the outset, it is contended that there are no averments\nagainst this respondent in this petition and the respondent has been\nimpleaded only to cause harassment to this respondent. The affidavit is\non similar lines as in the case of the preceding two respondents in\nregard to the contentions on Freedom of Speech and Expression.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_144\">Counter    affidavit   on     behalf   of   respondent   no.    17    -   News\nBroadcasters Federation\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_145\">87.         It is contended that the public interest petitions seeking\nrelief of temporary postponement, inter alia, of news reporting in relation\nto the unfortunate death of the actor are not only in effect attempting to\nrestrain all media houses from making any publication but is in fact an\nattempt to deprive the public of information in relation to the said\nunfortunate incident. The relief, if granted, would curtail the freedom of\npress enshrined under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_164\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution of India. There\nis apprehension that the petition involves elements of private interest\nand is directly or indirectly connected with the film industry as seen\nfrom the petition. Also, the petition filed by the retired police officials is\nnot maintainable being motivated. The intention is to suppress the\nshortcomings in the investigation carried out by the police force in\nMaharashtra and muzzle the media from bringing forth these details\nbefore the public at large.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_146\">88.         It is contended that this respondent is a private association\nconsisting of various regional news channels and current affairs\nbroadcasters which is about 60 members and is a single representative\nbody which presents a unified and credible voice before the various\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_120\">                                      84</span>\n                                                     Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\nregulatory    authorities,   government   departments     and     other    key\nstakeholders for the purpose of ensuring effective growth of the industry\nfor all its members.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_147\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"456839\" id=\"span_121\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"223504\" id=\"span_122\">89.

The affidavit states that this respondent has formulated\n&quot;Broad Framework on Editorial Guidelines&quot; for its member-channels\nwhich explicitly states that members of this respondent shall refrain\nthemselves from certain actions which are set out in paragraph 22. It is\ncontended that there is a procedure for strict compliance of this\nguidelines. Also, a complaint redressal mechanism has been formulated.\nIn case of any violation, a complaint can be made to the designated\ngrievance cell and after hearing the alleged erring channel, if it is found\nthat there is violation of any of the norms, the panel issues\norder/warning directing the defaulting member- channel to run an\napology scroll specifying the date and time and such other action to be\ntaken. Repeated violation by the defaulting member-channel is also\npenalized with an order/warning to run an apology scroll for 2 days and\nremoval of the defaulting anchor for upto three months and/or a\nfinancial penalty up to Rs. 5 lakhs. Any repeat violations by such\ndefaulting members would also attract a financial penalty up to Rs.10\nlakhs.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_149\">91.

The affidavit justifies action taken by the TV channels in\nrespect of alleged complaint as made in the petition filed by the retired\npolice officials.

The affidavit also sets out the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_127\">                                      86</span>\n                                                       Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\nposition of the NBSA and the procedure which the NBSA would adopt to\nadjudicate such complaint.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_155\">95.          In the affidavit dated October 6, 2020 it is stated that the\nNBSA has passed orders on the complaints received by it in respect of\nmember-broadcasters on telecast relating to the death of the actor.\nOrders passed by the NBSA are placed on record, which would be\nbinding on its members. NBSA has stated that orders have been passed\nby it based on whether the member-broadcasters have violated the Code\nof Ethics, various guidelines and advisories issued from time to time.\nClarificatory observation is made at the end of each order that in the\nstatement by both the parties in proceedings before the NBSA, while\nresponding to the complaint and putting forth their view points, any\nfinding or observation by the NBSA in regard to the broadcasters in its\nproceedings or in such order, are only in the context of examination as\nto whether there are any violations of any broadcasting standards and\nguidelines; they are not intended to be &quot;admissions&quot; by the broadcaster\nnor intended to be &quot;findings&quot; by the NBSA in regard to any civil/\ncriminal liability.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_156\">96.          In the additional affidavit dated October 11, 2020, it is\nstated that the NBSA has always dealt with the complaint received by it\nas expeditiously as possible and has also decided several complaints in\nrespect of broadcasting and reportage on the unnatural death of the\nactor. In regard to concern of the petitioner on media trial on such\ndeath, it is submitted that the NBSA has issued additional advisories\nand guidelines which would clarify the doubt that even on the aspect of\nmedia trial, there are already such instructions issued by the NBSA. It is\nstated that there are well established fundamental principles of Code of\nEthics and Broadcasting Standards which the members of the NBA are\nbound to follow while telecasting its programmes. The Ethics includes\nthat   the   broadcasters   should   report   fairly    with    integrity    and\nindependence, adhere to the highest possible standards of public service\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_128\">                                     87</span>\n                                                     Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\nand recognize that they have a special responsibility since they have the\nmost potent influence on the public opinion. There are specific\nguidelines covering the reportage to deal with the fact that information\ngathered should be reported accurately and the facts should be clearly\ndistinguishable from and not be mixed up with opinion, analysis and\ncomment.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_157\">97.           It is contended that in furtherance of principles and\nregulations, the broadcasters are bound to follow rules <a href=\"/doc/362532/\" id=\"a_171\">laid down by</a> the\nguidelines for conducting &#x27;sting operations&#x27;. It is stated that the NBSA\nhas laid down specific guidelines that requires the broadcasters to\nstrictly vet and edit the reportage of sensitive matters and to ascertain\nits veracity and credibility. The broadcasters should not make any\ndefamatory, derogatory, derisive or judgmental statements. It is stated\nthat also specific guidelines are formulated for reporting the court\nproceedings. In view of all these guidelines, it can be inferred that the\nNBSA can adjudicate upon complaints received by it on several aspects\nthat impact the trial or investigation by the police and action can be\ntaken against any broadcaster who has violated the Code of Ethics and\nguidelines.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_158\">COUNTER AFFIDAVIT ON BEHALF OF T.V. TODAY NETWORK\nLIMITED (INDIA TODAY GROUP)\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_159\">98.           It is stated that the petition does not involve any public\ninterest and is clearly aimed at espousing the cause of certain\nindividuals presently occupying positions within Bombay police. The\npetitioners themselves were part and parcel of the Maharashtra Police.\nHence, it is necessary that claims and assertions in the petition are put\nto strict scrutiny when the petition seeks to place restraint upon media\non the basis of perceived fear of jeopardy to the reputation of police and\nabout loss of faith of public in the system and in police administration.\nIt is set out that even police administration is susceptible to aberrations,\nmal-functioning and corruption due to various internal and external\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_129\">                                      88</span>\n                                                     Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\nfactors. It is submitted that not only relating to the death of the actor\nbut in most of the so-called high-profile cases, this respondent has been\ndutifully performing the role of a watchdog against possibility of\ninjustice upon any individual, be it a victim or the accused. In a case\nthey may be unnoticed because common people are overawed by the\nglitz of the police machinery. The petitioners cannot expect that the\nmedia should turn a blind eye to the shortcomings of the police when on\none hand the media channels also shower praise on their achievements\nand successful investigation. It is submitted that the petitioners have\nthemselves interrogated with the media frequently with the intent of\ngaining publicity for their official acts while they were in service. Such\ninformation is available on Google Search. It is, however, unfair for them\nto expect that the media should refrain from showing the other side of\nthe police to the people of India. The petitioners&#x27; fear of the people losing\nfaith in media is completely imaginary and baseless. Expecting the\nmedia to be censored till completion of investigation and thereafter till\nthe Court&#x27;s verdict would mean that the petitioners are keen to postpone\na healthy and timely public debate and are concerned more about\npersonal and vested interest of policemen rather than any public\ninterest. If matters are left exclusively to &quot;official police machinery&quot; and\nif there is no public awareness and awakening about the ongoing\nprocess of investigation as also about ongoing trial proceedings in a\nCourt of Law, it may be too late when the follies are realized and in such\nsituations there would be irreparable harm and injury to justice itself.\nHence, prayers made by the petitioners factually seek to glorify and\njustify the static nature of system when the system needs constant\nscrutiny, constructive criticism and corrective measures are required to\nbe encouraged. Hence, omnibus prayers ought not to be granted. Rest\nof the contents of this affidavit are similar to the points of this\nrespondent&#x27;s counter affidavit filed in the case of Nilesh Navlakha and\nothers.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_130\">                                    89</span>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_160\">                                                   Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\nCounter affidavit on behalf of Zee Media\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_161\">99.

Also, the petition is not maintainable, as the petitioners\nhave alternate efficacious remedy of filing the complaint before the NBA.\nThe petitioners have no locus standi to maintain this petition, as the\npetitioners are neither the accused nor aggrieved persons, whose right to\nfair trial have been allegedly curtailed in any manner by the respondent.\nThe petitioners have also not been subjected to any breach or violation\nof the Programme Code as <a href=\"/doc/362532/\" id=\"a_172\">laid down in</a> the CTVN Act and Rules framed\nthereunder.

Nilesh Navalakha, petitioner no. 1 has filed a rejoinder\naffidavit dated October 10, 2020 dealing with the reply affidavit filed by\nrespondent no.1-UOI primarily contending that the affidavits as filed on\nbehalf of the MI&amp;B have not addressed the principal issue before this\nCourt, namely of media trial. The affidavits of the MI&amp;B are completely\nsilent as to what steps have been taken by the MI&amp;B in respect of media\ntrial qua the death of the actor and whether the electronic media has\ncomplied with their mandatory obligations under the Programme Code\nas mandated in Rule 6 of the CTVN Rules.           It is stated that the\nUOI/MI&amp;B has abdicated its primary role of calling for accountability or\nimplementing the role of law and obligations under the Uplinking and\nDownlinking guidelines, more particularly when in the reply affidavit of\nthe UOI it is recognized as a self-regulatory mechanism created by the\nelectronic media. It is submitted that self-regulation can only be in\naddition to the existing legal framework and cannot be in substitution of\nit. It is stated that when the complaint of the petitioner was referred to\nthe NBSA, it is clear that the UOI/MIB had abdicated its primary role of\ncalling for implementing the rule of law under the Uplinking and\nDownlinking guidelines. It is stated that the UOI has also established\nElectronic Media Monitoring Centre (EMMC) with the view to monitor\nand record the content of satellite TV channels with regard to violation\nof Programme and Advertisement Codes under the CTVN Act and Rules,\nwhich is supposed to be equipped to monitor and record around 900\nchannels. It is stated that if the EMMC is in existence and functional\nand content on the TV channels is claimed to be monitored, it is not\nknown as to how the repeated violations of the Programme Code\nenshrined under the CTVN Act and Rules escape the scrutiny of the\ncommittee.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_168\">103.         By this affidavit the Uplinking and Downlinking guidelines\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_132\">                                    91</span>\n                                                   Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\nof 2011 are placed on record under which permission for satellite TV\nchannels are granted under two categories, namely, &#x27;News and Current\nAffairs TV channels&#x27; and Non-News and Current Affairs TV channels&#x27;. A\ncondition is imposed under the General Terms and Conditions\n(Condition No. 5.2) which apply the Programme and Advertising Codes\nand the rules framed under the CTVN Act and Rules.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_169\">104.        It is stated that as regards the broadcasting media industry\nin India, it is divided into two different bodies to represent television\nnews channels - i) NBA; and (ii) NBF. It is stated that neither of these\ntwo bodies have any statutory recognition.      They are merely private\nbodies, which claim to be a part of the self-regulatory mechanism for the\nelectronic media. The bodies cannot be a total replacement for the\nstatutory and other obligations as mandated by the Rule of Law. It is\nsubmitted that restrictions under <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_174\">Article 19(2)</a> can be only imposed by\nthe State and not by any private body. Hence, the mechanism of self-\nregulation as a substitution for Government regulation is not only\ncontrary to the scheme of the &#x27;Constitution&#x27; but also arbitrary.        Self-\nregulatory mechanism can be in addition to the rule of law but not in\nsubstitution. Also, there is no mechanism for enforcement of the orders\nof the private self-regulatory bodies and non-compliance has no\nconsequences.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_170\">105.        It is stated that the UOI/MI&amp;B has been selective for the\nreasons best known to itself in imposing its own Programme Code and\nhas sought to depend upon a non-statutory organization to adjudicate\nupon the complaints made against its members. UOI has not made any\nattempts to even ensure that the orders passed by the NBSA are also\nenforced in letter and spirit. This inaction on the part of the UOI smacks\nof malafide and is arbitrary.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_133\">                                      92</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_171\">                                                     Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_172\">106.        A reference is made to an order passed by the Delhi High\nCourt in Writ Petition No. 6568 of 2020 emanating from the present\nissue wherein the High Court has reprimanded UOI and directed MI&amp;B\nto issue interim directions to the media houses. Pursuant thereto, the\nUOI after almost four months of miscarriage of justice has on October 9,\n2020 issued advisory to the media channels to adhere to the Programme\nCode. In these circumstances, it is contended that the petition is\nrequired to be allowed.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_173\">107.        There is a consolidated rejoinder to the counter/reply\naffidavits filed by the respondent nos.4, 12 and 13 by the petitioner\nno.1-Nilesh Navalakha dated October 10, 2020, whereby the petitioners\nhave placed on record several instances being extracts of the\nprogrammes of different channels which according to the petitioners was\nnot a media (sic) but vilification campaign severely affecting the rights of\nfree and fair trial and affect a fair investigation. It is contended that the\nbroadcasters have telecast highly sensitive/confidential information\nincluding Whatsapp chats, CDRs etc. which are in fact obtained from\nthe investigating agencies. Following paragraphs in the counter affidavit\naccording to the petitioners affect the conduct of the investigating\nagencies and news channels as may be noted:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_43\">            &quot;5.   I say that the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court and\n            several High Courts have time and again\n            deprecated    the    conduct/practice  of   the\n            investigating agencies selectively leaking the\n            sensitive and confidential information with\n            respect to the status of investigation or the\n            personal information of the accused or the\n            complainant to the media.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_44\">            6.    I say that various broadcaster have\n            telecasted      highly     sensitive/confidential\n            information in connection with ongoing criminal\n            investigations, where the news outlet have made\n            various statements based on purported\n            disclosure statements made by the accused and\n            other witnesses to the Investigating officers\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_134\">                        93</span>\n                                       Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\nattributing the source of information to be from\nthe investigating agencies. It is submitted that\nthe news channel have also on their shows\ndisplayed the questions/interrogations made by\nthe officer to the accused or witnesses. It is\nsubmitted that such information to which only\nthe officers or the person being question should\nbe privy to have reached the media channels.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_45\">7.     I say that further, private Whatsapp chats\nexchanged between the accused, the deceased\nlate actor, and other witness etc. were displayed\non the programmes.

It is submitted that a prominent anchor of\nTimes Now during the course of hearing of a\ncase on Media Trial before the NBSA on\n24.09.2020 orally admitted that the whatsapp\nchats, CDRs.

He states that the NBSA was\nformed as a separate offshoot of the NBA pitching itself as a completely\ndistinct and independent body.    It is stated that as one of the news\nchannel, Republic TV, was not inclined to tender an unconditional\napology as ordered by the NBSA, the said news channel withdrew its\nmembership of the NBA and instead of abiding by the directions of the\nNBSA, formed the NBF as an alternate self-regulatory body. It is\nsubmitted that NBF has no grievance resolution mechanism. UOI/MIB\nhas not even recognized or have even mentioned the presence of the NBF\nas a self-regulatory body. It is contended that there are several small\nand large news channels which are not members of either the NBA or\nthe NBF and thus, continue to air or broadcast anything in the garb of\nfree speech. NBA including the NBSA and the NBF have been rendered\nmerely as rubber-stamps and paper-tigers and are ineffective when it\ncomes to regulation of media channels or any substantial reasonable\nrestriction on the transgression, abuses and misuse of free speech\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_138\">                                      97</span>\n                                                      Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\nthereof. The adjudicatory authorities like the NBSA are bodies against\nthe fundamental and cardinal principle of natural justice that &#x27;no one\ncan be a Judge in its own cause&#x27; and all proceedings of such authorities\naccordingly stand vitiated and always coloured with prejudice and bias\nin favour of its constituent members. It is submitted that in view of the\nineffective grievance mechanism and failure of the self-regulating\norganization, several petitions across the country are filed seeking\neffective guidelines and mechanism, the details of which are set out in\nparagraph 15 of the rejoinder affidavit. It is contended that there is an\nongoing turf/war between the NBA and the NBF constituents, as if two\nbelligerent TRP thirsty factions or gangs fighting for supremacy and\ndominance over one another. It is a sorry state of the media today that\nin the dirty skirmish for TRPs, the truth is the first of the casualties.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_175\">109.        There is also a consolidated rejoinder affidavit to the\ncounter/reply affidavits filed on behalf of the respondent nos. 6, 7, 8,\n11, 14, 15 and 16 whereby the petitioners denied the factual and legal\nstand taken in the reply affidavits of these respondents.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_176\">110.        We need not discuss in detail the contents of these\naffidavits. Suffice it to note that the petitioners by this affidavit would\nurge that the entire media reporting of the actor&#x27;s death amounts to a\nmedia trial offending the Programme Code prescribed under the CTVN\nAct and Rules and action in this regard were required to be taken by the\nUOI.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_177\">Additional Affidavit in PIL of M.N. Singh &amp; Ors.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_178\">111.        There is an additional affidavit dated 8 September 2020 by\nSatish Chand Mathur on behalf of respondent No.7. By this affidavit,\nthe petitioner has brought on record certain videos and its transcripts\nhighlighting the conduct of the members of respondent Nos.3 and 4\nwhich according to them is material to decide the present petition. The\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_139\">                                    98</span>\n                                                   Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\npetitioners contend that they have prayed for a direction against\nrespondent Nos.2 to 4 to ensure that reporting of crimes and criminal\ninvestigations are carried out in a balanced, ethical, unbiased and\nobjective manner and not to turn such reporting into media trial and a\nvilification campaign against the police, investigators and others.        In\nsupporting this contention, the petitioner has annexed copies of certain\nscreen-shots of the broadcasts against Mumbai police in contending\nthat, such screen-shots would demonstrate a vicious campaign run by\nthe members of respondent Nos.3 and 4 and how unfair aspersions are\ncast on Mumbai Police by the media. Such material is placed on record\nto urge that irresponsible and maliciously false propaganda was made\nby the media houses against Mumbai police stated to be clear from the\nvideos of the broadcast. Such grievance as raised by the petitioner is\nagainst the Republic T.V., Times Now and Aaj Tak of their broadcasts on\nvarious dates as set out in paragraph 5 of the affidavit. It is contended\nthat although there was caution to the media to exercise restraint by an\norder dated 3 September 2020 passed by this Court, there was a total\ncontravention of the said order by the members of respondent Nos.3 and\n4 who continued the unabated barrage of allegations and running a\nvilification campaign against Mumbai police thereby transforming the\ncrime reporting into media trial, hampering the ongoing investigations.\nThe transcripts of the videos broadcasted by the Republic TV on 3\nSeptember 2020, and 4 September 2020, subsequent to the order dated\n3 September 2020 passed by this Court are placed on record along with\na Compact Disk.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_179\">112.        There is another additional affidavit dated 22 September\n2020 filed on behalf of the petitioners again to bring on record certain\nvideos and its transcripts highlighting the conduct of the members of\nrespondent nos. 3 and 4 stated to be in breach of the orders dated 3\nSeptember 2020 and 10 September, 2020 passed by this Court urging\nmembers of respondent nos. 3 and 4 to show restraint in the media\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_140\">                                    99</span>\n                                                   Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\nreporting pertaining to the death of actor. The primary grievance in this\naffidavit is again against Republic TV and the debates being held on this\nchannel between 9 p.m. to 10. p.m. on 11 September, 2020, 13\nSeptember, 2020, 14 September 2020, 15 September 2020, 18\nSeptember 2020 and 20 September 2020. The affidavit gives extracts of\nthe objectionable contents to contend that such telecast were in\nabsolute disregard to the spirit of the orders passed by this Court on 3\nSeptember, 2020 and 10 September, 2020.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_180\">Submission of Advocate Mr.Kamath on behalf of the PIL petitioners\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_181\">- Nilesh Navlakha and others:-\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_182\">113.        At the outset Mr.Kamath has submitted that the present PIL\nraises an issue as to whether a media trial of the kind unleashed by the\nrespondent-news broadcasters on the death of the actor can be said to\nbe legal and permissible expression of the right under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_175\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of\nthe Constitution.    The second issue raised is as to whether the\ncontract/licence entered into between the broadcaster and the UOI\nunder the Up-linking/Down-linking guidelines would be binding on the\nbroadcasters. The third issue which he raises is as to whether the MI&amp;B\nbeing the Nodal Ministry has abdicated its statutory functions under the\nCTVN Act and the Rules read with the policy guidelines of 2011 and the\nlicence executed with the broadcaster, to the private bodies like NBSA\nand NBF.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_183\">114.        It is submitted that the need to file the present PIL petition\nhad arisen in view of the spectre of media trials by the news\nbroadcasters (media channels) which have become the order of the day.\nSuch media trials, according to him, not only impede the right to a fair\ntrial guaranteed to accused persons but is also an overreach of the\nfreedom under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_176\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of fair and proportionate reporting. It is\ncontended by him that the case of the petitioners is that in the garb of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_141\">                                      100</span>\n                                                     Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\n&#x27;public interest&#x27;, the news broadcasters have exploited the unfortunate\ndeath of the actor for generation of TRP, by sensationalizing the\ninvestigation relating to his death and conducting a parallel media trial.\nSuch coverage, according to him, is not only in bad taste, but also\nantithetical to the rule of law. Hence strict action against news\nbroadcasters conducting a parallel media trial and for violating the\nProgramme Code needs to be taken.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_184\">115.         It is submitted that although the right of freedom of speech\nand expression as enshrined in <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_177\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution is the\nhallmark of a democracy, thereby protecting the right of the free press\nand the free media, however, like every fundamental right, the freedom\nof the press and media cannot be unlimited or unfettered. This even if it\nis accepted that necessity of a free media for the proper functioning of a\ndemocratic polity cannot be undermined. In this context, a reference is\nmade to the observations of Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., in\nSchenck vs. United States, reported in 249 US 47, when His Lordship\nobserved &quot;....... The most stringent protection of free speech would not\nprotect a man in falsely shouting fire in a theatre and causing a panic\n......&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_185\">116.         It is submitted that the guarantee of the right to freedom of\nspeech and expression in India, is different from the First Amendment to\nthe American Constitution, which proscribes the Houses of Congress\nfrom making any laws &quot;abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_61\">and provides for reasonable restrictions imposable by law as provided in\n<a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_178\">Article 19(2).</a> Hence under the Indian Constitution the freedom of speech\nand expression guaranteed to the citizenry is not unlimited. It is\nsubmitted that right of the press and the media cannot be higher than\nthe rights of the common citizenry, especially when the media claims to\nbe exercising the said right in &#x27;public interest&#x27;.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_186\">117.         He further contended that the right to freedom of speech\nand expression enjoyed by the press and the media is in actuality the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_142\">                                     101</span>\n                                                     Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\nright enjoyed by the private owner of the news broadcaster (media\nchannel). In this context a reference is made to the observations made\nby Mr.Laurence H. Tribe, constitutional scholar, who observes            &quot;......\nPeople have come increasingly to rely on television and radio for\ninformation.    Newspapers, still a viable means of communication, are\nincreasingly concentrated in the hands of a few large chains. In short,\nmore and more of the most important forums and means of communication\nare coming under the control of fewer and fewer private owners.&quot;\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_187\">118.           <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1475436\" id=\"span_143\">In the above context, a reference is also made to the\nobservations of the Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/1475436/\" id=\"a_179\">Virendra</a> (supra) wherein the\npress has been recognized as an institution with immense and\nenormous power on the minds of the readers. The Court observed that\nthe wide sweep of the reach of the newspapers and the modern facilities\nfor their swift circulation to territories, distant and near, must all enter\ninto the judicial verdict and the reasonableness of the restrictions\nimposed upon the press has to be tested against this background. It is\ncontended that the same would be true in the case of electronic media\nwhere the power would be much higher than those of the newspapers.</span>\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"341773\" id=\"span_144\">In this context, reliance is placed on the decision of the Supreme Court\nin <a href=\"/doc/341773/\" id=\"a_180\">S. Rangarajan vs. P. Jagjivan Ram</a>, reported in (1989) 2 SCC 574, in\nwhich the Court was dealing with a question of prior restraint on\ncinematographic films under the <a href=\"/doc/980182/\" id=\"a_181\">Cinematograph Act, 1952</a>.                  It is\nsubmitted that what would be the influence of such media on the mass\naudience who are generally not selective about what they watch,\nbecomes all the more relevant in the present context.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_188\">119.           It is hence submitted that dissemination of news being\navailable to the public at large in their homes, without any hindrance\nand restriction in real time, the news broadcasters have a powerful\ninfluence on the public opinion and public discourse. It is submitted\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_145\">                                    102</span>\n                                                    Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\nthat although prior restraint on the exercise of freedom of speech on the\nnews broadcaster is not desirable, it cannot be said that the power\nexercised by the broadcaster cannot be without accountability or\nresponsibility. In this context, Mr.Kamat has referred to the thoughts of\nJohn Stuart Mill, in his treatise - &#x27;On Liberty&#x27;, when he observed:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_62\">            &quot;........ The acts of an individual may be hurtful\n            to others, or wanting in due consideration for\n            their welfare, without going to the length of\n            violating any of their constituted rights. The\n            offender may then be justly punished by\n            opinion, though not by law. As soon as any part\n            of a person&#x27;s conduct affects prejudicially the\n            interests of others, society has jurisdiction over\n            it, and the question whether the general welfare\n            will or will not be promoted by interfering with\n            it, becomes open to discussion. ...........&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_189\">120.        It is submitted that media trial is an affront to the rule of\nlaw and interferes with administration of justice. To buttress this, the\npetitioners have presented in the pleadings several instances of a\nparallel media trial pertaining to the death of the actor, carried out by\nthe Respondents-news broadcasters. It is submitted that these news\nbroadcasters with impunity have attempted to influence public opinion\non the guilt or otherwise of suspects, discussed material evidence, cross\nexamined witnesses on live television, etc. According to the petitioners,\nsuch coverage is antithetical to the rule of law, and also in direct\ncontravention of the right to fair trial, right to reputation, etc. of\npersons. Such media trial is an affront to two foundational principles of\nour Constitution, namely, the Rule of law and the administration of\njustice by the Courts.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_190\">121.        By referring to the 200th Law Commission Report as to what\nconstitutes a &quot;Media Trial&quot;, it was urged that the Law Commission of\nIndia has categorized 10 types of publications in the media as\nprejudicial to a suspect or accused:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_63\">            (i)   publications concerning the character of accused or\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_146\">                                          103</span>\n                                                      Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\nprevious conclusions;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_64\">            (ii)    publication of confessions;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_65\">            (iii)   publications which comment or reflect upon the\nmerits of the case;\n</blockquote><pre id=\"pre_5\">            (iv)    photographs;\n            (v)     police activities;\n            (vi)    imputation of innocence;\n            (vii)   creating an atmosphere of prejudice;\n            (viii) criticism of witnesses;\n\n\n            (ix)    premature publication of evidence;\n            (x)     publication of interviews with witnesses.\n\n\n</pre><blockquote id=\"blockquote_66\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1515299\" id=\"span_147\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1511447\" id=\"span_148\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1454600\" id=\"span_149\">122.        It is submitted that the malice of media trials has been\nadversely commented upon by the Supreme Court in a plethora of\njudgments whereby it is held that a trial by press, electronic media or\npublic agitation is the very antithesis of the rule of law and it can well\nlead to miscarriage of justice. To buttress this submission, reliance is\nplaced on the decisions in <a href=\"/doc/1454600/\" id=\"a_182\">Rajendra Jawanmal Gandhi</a> (supra); <a href=\"/doc/1511447/\" id=\"a_183\">M.P.\nLohia</a> (supra), and <a href=\"/doc/1515299/\" id=\"a_184\">Sidhartha Vashisht @ Manu Sharma</a> (supra).</span></span></span>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_67\">123.        It is submitted by Mr.Kamat that the telecasts on the death\nof the actor contained details of the investigation, which were leaked by\nsources, and the media is speculating about the same on prime time. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"62107217\" id=\"span_150\">In\nthis regard, referring to the decision of Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/62107217/\" id=\"a_185\">Rajendran\nChingaravelu v. R.K. Mishra</a>, reported in (2010) 1 SCC 457 [Pg. 465],\nhe submitted that the Supreme Court has held that &quot;Premature\ndisclosures or &quot;leakage&quot; to the media in a pending investigation will not\nonly jeopardise and impede further investigation, but many a time, allow\nthe real culprit to escape from law.&quot;</span>          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"52834611\" id=\"span_151\">This principle has also been\nreiterated in a subsequent decision in <a href=\"/doc/52834611/\" id=\"a_186\">Romila Thapar v.

Next, it is submitted that the UOI being the repository of the\nresource of the &quot;airwaves&quot; is duty bound to ensure that the conditions\nfor grant of airwaves are strictly complied with. In this regard, he\nsubmitted that under Entry 31 of List 1 of the 7th Schedule to the\nConstitution, the UOI would have exclusive power to make laws in\nrespect of broadcasting. The exclusive privilege of granting licenses for\nthe use of air waves, lies with the Central Government, under <a href=\"/doc/1927191/\" id=\"a_187\">Section 4</a>\nof the Telegraph Act, 1882. The licenses are granted to broadcasters.\nThe broadcasters apply for grant of licenses to use this public property\n(air waves) for commercial exploitation, upon satisfaction of the\nconditions <a href=\"/doc/52834611/\" id=\"a_188\">laid down in</a> the Up-linking/Down-linking guidelines under\nwhich permission is granted by the MI&amp;B and subsequently, a license is\ngranted.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_193\">125.        It is urged that the broadcaster, while using airwaves (public\nproperty) for broadcast, cannot claim immunity from being regulated or\nbe accountable qua the public interest. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"539407\" id=\"span_153\">In supporting this submission,\nreliance is placed on the decision of the Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/539407/\" id=\"a_189\">Secretary,\nMinistry of Information and Broadcasting v. Cricket Association of\nBengal</a>, reported in (1995) 2 SCC 161 to contend that the Supreme\nCourt has held that airwaves constitute public property and must be\nutilized for advancing public good. The Court has also held that it is the\nduty of the State to see that airwaves are so utilized so as to advance the\nfree speech rights of the citizens which is served by ensuring plurality\nand diversity of views, opinions and ideas. It is submitted that the free\nspeech right guaranteed to every citizen of this country does not\nencompass the right to use these airwaves at his choosing, and\nconceding such a right would be detrimental to the free speech rights of\nthe body of citizens, in as much as only the privileged few, powerful\neconomic, commercial and political interests, would come to dominate\nthe media. It is thus submitted that it is incumbent upon the State to\nensure that there is a balancing of rights of various stake holders. In the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_154\">                                    105</span>\n                                                    Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\nevent of the failure of the State, it is submitted that this Court and the\nSupreme Court, in exercise of the wide powers of judicial review, must\ndirect the State to balance the rights. The petitioners, thus, seek a\ndirection to the State/UOI to implement the tenets of the Programme\nCode&#x27;, which the news broadcasters are bound to comply, in the case of\nthe on-going media trial on the death of the actor. It is submitted that\nunlike the PCI Act, there is no statutory regulator for the electronic news\nbroadcasters (media channels) in India, although there is a regulatory\nmechanism in terms of the contractual obligations under the permission\nto uplink/downlink.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_194\">126.        It is next submitted that the Up-linking/Down-linking\nguidelines bring about contractual obligations on the broadcasters,\nwhich include the news broadcasters. The broadcasters are governed by\nthe CTVN Act and the Rules framed thereunder, by virtue of the contract\nentered into by the broadcaster. In this context, a reference is made to\nsection 5 of the CTVN Act which provides for the Programme Code and it\nwas urged     that the broadcaster is also governed by the                Up-\nlinking/Down-linking guidelines under which two types of permissions\nare granted by the UOI, firstly, permission for news and current affairs\nand secondly permission for non-news and current affairs. The petition\nalthough concerns the first category, it is argued that the general terms\nand conditions as stipulated under the guidelines for Up-linking/Down-\nlinking are relevant in as much as any violation of the CTVN Act and the\nRules framed thereunder would entail penalties including prosecution.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_195\">127.        It is submitted that in an application as made by the\nbroadcasters and for grant of a licence when a broadcaster undertakes\nto comply with the tenets of the Programme Code and the Advertising\nCode as prescribed under the CTVN Act and the Rules framed\nthereunder that too by filing affidavit alongwith the application form, in\nrespect of the contents broadcast, the broadcasters in that event are\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_155\">                                   106</span>\n                                                     Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\nbound by all the terms and conditions of such rules and regulations\nrevolving around it. A reference is also made to the &quot;proforma affidavit&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_68\">under which the broadcasters applying for a permission undertake that\nthe permission/approval granted can be withdrawn if the broadcasters\ndo not adhere their broadcast as per the Programme/ Advertising Codes.\nThere being a binding contract between the Government of India and the\nbroadcasters, it is thus not open to the broadcasters to canvass a self-\nregulation contrary to the conditions of approval as imposed on them by\nthe Government. The regime of self-regulation can be recognized,\nprovided there is no such licence and the binding effect of these\nguidelines and the rules and regulations is withdrawn. Such is not the\ncase according to the petitioners. The kind of self-regulation, as being\ncanvassed by the respondents, is an extra-legal mechanism which is not\nrecognized, rather is completely alien to the CTVN Act and the Rules. It\nis submitted that in any case it is not the case of the broadcasters that\nwhat has been prescribed by the rules namely the Programme Code\nand/or the restrictions under the licence and as imposed by the Up-\nlinking and Down-linking guidelines are in any manner violative of their\nfundamental    rights   guaranteed   under    <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_190\">Article     19(1)(a)</a>    of    the\nConstitution. In fact, the broadcasters also recognize these rights as\nvalid restrictions imposed under <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_191\">Article 19(2)</a> of the Constitution. It is\nthus submitted that the Programme Code has been incorporated to\nregulate the content of the broadcasters within the permission for Up-\nlinking/Down-linking which is binding on the broadcasters not only\nunder the provisions of the CTVN Act and the Rules framed thereunder,\nbut also as per the Up-linking/Downlinking guidelines. In this context,\nas per the mechanism, any complaint for the violation of the Programme\nCode/Advertising Code as against a broadcaster (including news\nbroadcasters), is required to be made to an Inter-Ministerial Committee\nof the UOI, and a suitable penalty as per the contractual obligation\nunder the permission for Up-linking/Down-linking can be imposed. The\nInter-Ministerial Committee can also act suo motu.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_156\">                                      107</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_69\">                                                    Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_196\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1008845\" id=\"span_157\">128.         Mr.Kamat submitted that in the event there is contravention\nof   the   Programme   Code,   the    necessary   corollary   is   that    the\nconsequences specified under the Up-linking/Down-linking guidelines\nwill follow. He further submitted that conducting an unfettered media\ntrial will be in contravention of the tenets of the Programme Code, and\ntherefore, it is imperative for the UOI to check the content of the\nbroadcast in respect of the media trial in relation to the death of the\nactor, followed by consequences in the event of contravention. Next, he\nsubmitted that there are obligations on the UOI under the guidelines for\npermission to uplink/downlink of television channels which cannot be\nabdicated by the Government to private bodies. In this regard, he\nsubmitted that the UOI has a duty to ensure that the Programme Code\nis complied with by the broadcaster. It was also submitted that UOI has\na duty cast upon it, to ensure that the air waves (public property) are\nnot used in a manner which are contrary to the tenets of the Programme\nCode, since the Programme Code mirrors the restrictions enumerated in\n<a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_192\">Article 19(2)</a>, and also is an expression of general public interest in\nrespect of news broadcast. Hence, it is submitted that the UOI is duty\nbound to ensure that the larger public interest is not compromised by\nthe news broadcaster, more particularly when it is exploiting public\nproperty for a commercial purpose. To support this submission, reliance\nwas placed on the decision of the Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/1008845/\" id=\"a_193\">Commissioner of\nPolice, Bombay vs. Gordhandas Bhanji</a>, reported in 1952 SCR 135,\nwherein the Supreme Court held that it is the duty of the person in\nwhom power is conferred to exercise the power in a manner as\nprescribed when called upon to do so. As the Government has a\nmechanism in place to deal with the violations of the Programme Code,\nsuo motu or upon a complaint, it is not open to the holder of the\nresource, not to achieve compliance of the Programme Code. This is\nmore so when the statutory body for the print media, namely, the PCI,\nhas issued an advisory to the print media on August 28, 2020 reminding\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_158\">                                     108</span>\n                                                     Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\nthe media to follow the norms of journalistic conduct in reporting on\nissues relating to the death of the actor. Considering all this, the\ninaction of the UOI has led the petitioners to file this PIL petition, as the\ncomplaint regarding the insensitive media reportage of the death of the\nactor as well as insensitive remarks qua the Indian Army made on June\n20, 2020 remained unattended, much less decided. According to the\npetitioners, it is surprising that such complaint was forwarded by the\nUOI to the NBSA which is a private body.          This action of the UOI,\naccording to the petitioners, is nothing but an act of abdication of a core\nfunction, viz. ensuring compliance of the conditions of the permission to\nuse natural resources (air waves), which is impermissible. The news\nbroadcasters ought to have been brought to book, instead of forwarding\nthe complaints of violation of the Programme Code to the NBSA, and\naction should have been taken by the UOI for non-compliance and\nproportionate consequences ought to have been imposed on the news\nbroadcaster. The broadcasters are also bound by the Up-linking/Down-\nlinking guidelines and the terms and conditions thereof. The news\nbroadcasters, given the mandate of Rule 6 of the CTVN Rules had no\noption, but to follow the tenets of the Programme Code, even while\nreporting on an ongoing trial. It is submitted that the tenets of the\nProgramme Code cannot be sacrificed at the altar of what is perceived as\n&quot;public interest&quot; in the individual opinion of the news broadcaster.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"178717\" id=\"span_159\">To\nsupport this contention, reliance is placed on the decision in <a href=\"/doc/178717/\" id=\"a_194\">New Bihar\nBiri Leaves Co. v. State of Bihar</a>, reported in (1981) 1 SCC 537 when\nthe Supreme Court observed that when a person with his eyes open and\non his own accord accepts the conditions in a contract entered with the\nState, he is bound by such conditions as may be contained in the\ncontract. He cannot be allowed to adhere to and abide by some of the\nterms of the contract which proved advantageous to him and repudiate\nthe other terms of the same contract which might be disadvantageous to\nhim. It is submitted that the maxim qui approbat non reprobat (one who\napprobates cannot reprobate) squarely becomes applicable in the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_160\">                                     109</span>\n                                                    Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\npresent context.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1974738\" id=\"span_161\">A reference is also made to the decision of the Supreme\nCourt in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1974738/\" id=\"a_195\">Excise Commr. vs. Issac Peter</a>, reported in (1994)\n4 SCC 104 to submit that when a person enters into a contract freely\nwith the State, there is no room for invoking the doctrine of fairness and\nreasonableness against one party to the contract (State), for the purpose\nof altering or adding to the terms and conditions of the contract, merely\nbecause it happens to be the State.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_197\">129.         It is thus submitted that the petitioners seek that the\nconditions of permission to uplink/downlink be complied with by the\nnews broadcasters, in the coverage/telecast of the investigation/trial in\nrespect of the death of the actor, and in the event of non-compliance, the\nUOI be directed to impose consequences in accordance with the terms\nand conditions of the permission to uplink/downlink. It is submitted\nthat when the news broadcasters have themselves agreed to comply with\nthe Programme Code in terms of an affidavit of undertaking, the news\nbroadcasters are estopped from resisting implementation of the\nconditions and the consequences for non-compliance, on a plea of\n<a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_196\">Article 19(1)(a).</a>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_198\">130.         It is submitted that the regime of self-regulation by the news\nbroadcasters cannot be a substitute for the failure of the UOI to\ndischarge its obligations under the licence issued to the news\nbroadcasters. This, more particularly when the NBSA and the NBF are\nprivate bodies, comprised of the private corporate media-channels,\nformed by the channels in a bid to self-regulate. The jurisdiction of these\nbodies extend only to the private members who expressly submit to their\njurisdiction, so as to be bound in a &#x27;self-regulatory&#x27; mechanism. NBSA is\na private-body, headed by a former Hon&#x27;ble Judge of the Supreme Court,\nformed so as to internally adjudicate upon violations, transgressions\nand non-compliances of its own Code of Ethics &amp; Broadcasting\nStandards. This mechanism is available only in respect of the members\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_162\">                                       110</span>\n                                                     Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\nof the NBA, and only to those news broadcasters who agree to subject\nthemselves to the jurisdiction of the NBSA. Also, the NBF was formed as\nan offshoot of the NBA, pitching itself as a completely distinct and\nindependent body of broadcasters, parallel to the NBA. As per the\nreports available in public domain on November 09, 2019, the NBSA, the\nself-regulatory authority, had directed an English news channel,\nRepublic TV (Respondent No.8), to air an unconditional apology for\npreviously undermining the authority of the NBSA in a case of ethical\nviolations. Instead of complying with the directions of the NBSA,\nRespondent No. 8 withdrew itself from the membership of the NBA and\nformed an alternate &quot;self-regulatory&quot; body named NBF, which has no\ngrievance resolution mechanism. The submission is that it is possible to\nhave different self-regulatory mechanisms at the hands of TV channels,\nwhen in our country there are more than 700 channels and all of them\nare not part of the self-regulatory mechanism. It is an argument\nadvanced by the news channels that they would not permit the UOI to\nexercise its control. It is submitted that it is not the first time that the\nmembers of the NBA have withdrawn from its membership. The other\nbroadcasters which include India TV had withdrawn from their\nmembership only to avoid non-compliance of the norms of the NBA as\nimposed by the NBSA. It was thus submitted that the self-regulatory\nmechanism being championed by the Respondents is totally illusory,\nthere is no real check on violations of even the Ethical Code, let alone\nthe mandatory Programme Code as prescribed under section 5 of the\nCTVN Act. It is submitted that both the NBA (including the NBSA) and\nthe NBF (which remains unrecognized by the UOI) have not been able to\neffectively   regulate   the   news   broadcasters   and    implement       the\nProgramme Code, which is being continually violated. In any event, the\nState&#x27;s regulatory mechanism cannot be replaced by self-regulatory\nmechanism, especially when it is concerning the use of public property,\nnamely the air waves. The self-regulatory bodies also do not adjudicate\nupon the violations of the Programme Code and merely adjudicate the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_163\">                                     111</span>\n                                                    Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\nviolation of their own broadcasting guidelines. It is submitted that a\nbroadcaster has no option but to comply with the Uplinking-\nDownlinking guidelines as well as the Programme Code; therefore the\nNBA/NBSA and the NBF admittedly have no jurisdiction to implement\nthe violation of the Programme Code and it is only the UOI which has\njurisdiction. This is the reason that neither have the petitioners sought\nany relief against the NBSA nor can the NBSA replace the UOI for\nimplementation of the legal framework. It is next submitted that the\nadjudicatory structure of the NBSA and the NBF as adjudicatory\nauthorities, go against the very fundamental and cardinal principle of\nnatural justice, viz. that &#x27;No one can be a Judge in its own cause,&#x27;\nthough such body could be headed by a former Judge of the Supreme\nCourt or of the High Court. These are private bodies having no authority\nin law to adjudicate upon any violations of the Programme Code or to\nensure that errant news broadcasters are visited with consequences.\nThere is also absolutely no enforcement mechanism for the orders of the\nself-regulatory authority. While the self-regulation mechanism may be in\naddition to the existing regime, it is submitted that it cannot replace the\nmechanism for enforcing the terms and conditions of the permission to\nuplink/downlink given to a news broadcaster. This is more so, when the\nnews broadcasters themselves undertake to comply with the &#x27;Programme\nCode&#x27; and the &#x27;Advertising Code&#x27;, and accept that in the event of non-\ncompliance, consequences will ensue. It is submitted that the NBSA\nbeing a private body, its decisions are not subject to the jurisdiction of\nthe High Courts or the Supreme Court under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_197\">Article 226</a> or <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_198\">Article 32</a>,\nrespectively. The maximum punishment for an infraction of the Code of\nEthics of the NBSA is merely a fine of Rs.1 lakh, which is a paltry sum\nfor a news broadcaster, and disproportionate to the effect of the\ninfraction.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_199\">131.          The next contention of Mr.Kamat is that the possibility of\nabuse cannot be a ground to validate the failure of the UOI to discharge\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_164\">                                    112</span>\n                                                    Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\nits obligations under the regulatory regime. It is submitted that a\ndoomsday picture has been painted on behalf of the NBA/NBSA as also\nby the media channels when they contend that UOI ought not to be\npermitted to regulate the media space as it could lead to a situation akin\nto the &quot;1975 Emergency&quot; and the excesses meted out to the Press.\nAccording to him, such an argument is misconceived for several\nreasons. First, neither the UOI nor any of the broadcasters have sought\nto question the present regulatory regime consisting of the Uplinking-\nDownlinking guidelines read with the terms and conditions of the\nlicense. There is even no challenge by the broadcasters to the existing\nlegal regime. In this background, neither the UOI nor the broadcasters\ncan escape their obligations under a binding agreement resting on some\napprehensions of abuse of power by the UOI. In the absence of any\nchallenge to the validity of the existing legal regime, the Respondents\ncannot wish away the same and seek the imprimatur of this Court on\nthe admitted deviations from the binding contract between the UOI and\nthe news broadcasters. Secondly, it is a well settled legal position that\nthe mere possibility of abuse is not a ground to deny the existence of a\npower. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1193965\" id=\"span_165\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"156242701\" id=\"span_166\">In this context, reliance is placed on the decision of the Supreme\nCourt in <a href=\"/doc/156242701/\" id=\"a_199\">Mafatlal Industries Ltd. vs. Union of India</a>, reported in (1997)\n5 SCC 536, wherein the Court referring to the case of <a href=\"/doc/1193965/\" id=\"a_200\">Collector of\nCustoms vs. Nathella Sampathu Chetty</a>, reported in 1962 AIR 316,\nobserved that &quot;(T)he possibility of abuse of a statute otherwise valid does\nnot impart to it any element of invalidity.&quot;</span></span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"174974\" id=\"span_167\">The Court, also referring to\nthe decision in <a href=\"/doc/174974/\" id=\"a_201\">State of Rajasthan v. Union of India</a>, reported in (1977)\n3 SCC 592, observed that the wisdom of man has not yet been able to\nconceive of a Government with power sufficient to answer all its\nlegitimate needs and at the same time incapable of mischief and it must\nbe remembered that merely because power may sometimes be abused, it\nis not a ground for denying its existence. What emerges is that it is not\nthe question as to whether the mechanism is good or bad, adequate or\ninadequate, but the question is when there are mandatory conditions for\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_168\">                                    113</span>\n                                                   Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\nthe exploitation of public property for commercial purposes, whether the\nconsequences for the non-compliance of those conditions are imposed\nby the UOI or not. It is then submitted that all the news broadcasters\nhave admitted to the binding nature of the Programme Code in relation\nto the content of the news broadcast, in addition to the admission given\nat the time of applying for permission. Also, there is no challenge to\nthese guidelines or to the Programme Code. It is thus submitted that the\nregime under the Up--linking/Down-linking guidelines cannot be\ndisputed by the private bodies and the news broadcasters.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"803341\" id=\"span_169\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1367797\" id=\"span_170\">In this\ncontext, reference was made to the decision of the Supreme Court in\n<a href=\"/doc/1367797/\" id=\"a_202\">State of U.P. vs. Harish Chandra</a>, reported in (1996) 9 SCC 309 to\ncontend that no mandamus can be issued to direct the Government to\nrefrain from enforcing the provisions of law or to do something which is\ncontrary to law and that the same principles have been reiterated by the\nSupreme Court in a subsequent decision in <a href=\"/doc/803341/\" id=\"a_203\">Union of India vs. S.K.\nSaigal</a>, reported in (2007) 14 SCC 556. It is next submitted that the\njudicial review by constitutional courts is the best check on abuse;\nhence, any action under the prevailing mechanism is subject to\nchallenge by invoking judicial review jurisdiction of this Court when\nthere is abuse of power by the State. Such abuse is not immune from a\nchallenge and judicial scrutiny. It is submitted that this Court may\ndirect that procedural safeguards be complied with by the UOI while it\nexercises power under the prevailing mechanism, in terms of providing\nof an opportunity for hearing and general compliance of the time\nhonoured principles of natural justice. It is submitted that this Court\nmay direct that any adverse order as against a news broadcaster will\nremain in abeyance for a period of 15 days or so as to enable the news\nbroadcaster to approach the appropriate Court. It is submitted that the\nprocess of action under the prevailing mechanism may be time\nconsuming, as the prevailing mechanism is consequential in nature, and\nnot as a prior restraint. In this regard, it is submitted that for the\npurposes of prior restraint, it is always open to the aggrieved parties to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_171\">                                    114</span>\n                                                    Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\napproach the jurisdictional Courts for injunctive relief complaining of a\ncontent proposed to be broadcast by the news broadcaster. However,\nthat cannot be in substitution of the contractual obligations under the\npermission envisaged in the Up-linking/Down-linking guidelines, and\nmandate of the Programme Code, that a news broadcaster is duty bound\nto comply with, and face the consequences that follow for non-\ncompliance thereof.</span></span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_200\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"169453366\" id=\"span_172\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"184449972\" id=\"span_173\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"58440\" id=\"span_174\">132.

At the outset, Mr.Chinoy submitted that in this petition the\nCourt should clarify and direct that all television channels in the course\nof a news report, panel discussion or otherwise shall not make\nobservations, statements, suggestions, or otherwise create a perception\nthat any person is guilty of an offence, or that any such person should\nbe arrested, regarding an ongoing police investigation, or a pending\ncriminal proceedings. The reasons being that such a media trial/pre-\njudgment interferes with or obstructs the administration of justice and\nconstitutes contempt of court and is covered by the prohibition\ncontained in rule 6(f) of the CTVN Rules which provides that &#x27;No\nprogramme should be carried in the cable service which contains anything\namounting to contempt of court&#x27;.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_203\">134.          In relation to the self-regulatory framework, it is submitted\nthat the News Broadcasting Standards Regulations provide for a Code of\nConduct under which the authority (NBSA) would entertain complaints\nand take actions. The maximum fine to be imposed by the authority is\nRs. 1,00,000 and in addition to this power, for the reasons to be\nrecorded   in   writing,   it   may   warn,   admonish,   censure,    express\ndisapproval against and/or impose a fine upon the broadcaster and/or\nrecommend to the concerned authority for suspension/ revocation of\nlicense of such broadcaster. It is submitted that the &quot;Code of Ethics and\nBroadcasting Standards&quot; also makes no provision in regard to contempt\nof court or media trial or a pre-judgement. There are specific guidelines\ncovering reportage as issued by the NBA. In paragraph 3.3 it is provided\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_177\">                                         116</span>\n                                                         Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\nthat &quot;Reports on crime should not amount to pre-judging or pre-deciding\na matter that is, or is likely to be subjudice&quot;. In paragraph 3.4 of these\nguidelines, it is provided that &quot;No publicity should be given to the\naccused or witnesses that may interfere in the administration of justice\nor be prejudicial to a fair trial.&quot; It is submitted that despite the statutory\n&amp; self regulatory framework, in regard to the ongoing criminal\ninvestigation into the death of the actor, certain TV Channels for the\npast few months were conducting a persistent media trial and have been\nrunning programmes/hashtags calling for the arrest of the actress. It is\nsubmitted that the record establishes that no action whatsoever has\nbeen taken against such TV Channels/ broadcasts either by the UOI or\nby the news broadcasters. Such persistent inaction in the face of\nrepeated broadcasts over a number of months, must result in a\nconclusion    of   total   abdication    of   their   duty/obligation     by    the\nUOI/EMMC and by the NBA to stop such offending broadcasts. It is\nsubmitted that it is a mis-apprehension that such media trial or a\nprejudgment during the pendency of a criminal investigation, does not\naffect the administration of justice and does not constitute contempt of\ncourt. In either of these situations, it is felt just and necessary that this\nCourt clarifies and directs that such media trial/pre-judgement, during\na pending criminal investigation, or the pendency of a criminal\nproceeding, affects the administration of justice, constitutes contempt of\ncourt and is covered by the prohibition contained in section 5 of the\nCTVN Act read with rule 6(f) of the CTVN Rules. The Government be\naccordingly directed to take steps under section 20(3) of the CTVN Act to\nprohibit the transmission or retransmission of such programmes and/or\nbroadcasts.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_204\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"118389240\" id=\"span_178\">135.

It is submitted that the requirement of criminal contempt,\nas defined in section 2 of the CoC Act, comprises of two relevant\nelements in the present context : the first being that <a href=\"/doc/45075855/\" id=\"a_218\">section 2(c)(ii)</a>\ncontemplating a publication which interferes or tends to interfere with\nthe due course of any &quot;judicial proceeding&quot; and the second being that\n<a href=\"/doc/45075855/\" id=\"a_219\">section 2(c)(iii)</a> contemplates a publication which interferes or tends to\ninterfere or obstruct the administration of justice &quot;in any other manner&quot;.\nIt is submitted that section 3(2) of the CoC Act qualifies and explains\nand/or is an exception to publication when there is no pendency of any\njudicial proceeding. However, as far as <a href=\"/doc/45075855/\" id=\"a_220\">section 2(c)(iii)</a>, there is complete\nabsence of any qualification or explanation when it speaks of a contempt\ncovered by any publication of the nature as specified in the said\nprovision, as clear from the words &quot;in any other manner&quot; as used in the\nprovision.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_209\">139.         According to the petitioner, the first position relates to\ninvocation of the CoC Act in respect of publication even in the absence\nof pendency of a judicial proceeding as per the explanation to <a href=\"/doc/1840572/\" id=\"a_221\">section\n3(2)</a>, to include only those proceedings wherein a challan has been filed\nor any other cases where cognizance is taken. It is urged that judicial\nproceedings must be said to have commenced when an FIR is filed.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_185\">                                     119</span>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_210\">                                                         Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\nHence any obstruction during the course of the investigation by the\nconcerned police on account of irresponsible or misleading publication\nshould attract an action for criminal contempt. It is submitted that\ninvestigation eventually forms the basis of cognizance leading to framing\nof charges and the trial. It is submitted that publication which tends to\nobstruct or mislead the process of investigation would vitiate the trial on\naccount of coerced witnesses, misleading publication and broadcast\nconfessions, tampered medical and forensic evidence etc. All this would\nlead to violating due process as provided under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_222\">Article 21</a> of the\nConstitution of India mandating free and fair trial. It is submitted that\neven the term &quot;pendency of judicial proceeding&quot; be viewed in its strictest\nperspective. An FIR has to be reported to the area Magistrate under\nsection 157 of the Cr. P.C. Such dual object is to clothe the Magistrate\nwith the jurisdiction of monitoring the investigation. Thus, the pillar of\ndefence is that the pendency of judicial proceedings for the purpose of\nthe CcC Act commences from the stage of investigation. Any publication,\nwhich obstructs the investigation in any manner gives rise to invocation\nof the CoC Act.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_211\">140.          On the second proposition, namely, in regard to the\ninvocation of the CoC Act, in the absence of pendency of any judicial\nproceedings, it is submitted that <a href=\"/doc/45075855/\" id=\"a_223\">section 2(c)(iii)</a> gets attracted when any\npublication    is   criminally   contumacious     and       it   obstructs      the\nadministration of justice &quot;in any other manner&quot;. Such words as used in\nthe said provision are inclusive. Hence such publication which obstructs\nthe administration of justice when the publisher is aware that the\nproceedings are imminent would attract the CoC Act.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_212\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"203322\" id=\"span_186\">141.

It was held that proceedings in the context of the CoC Act\nwould be required to be considered pending from such date whereafter\nthe proceedings against the accused would become imminent. It is\nsubmitted that the Court propounded that contempt of court may be\ncommitted by a person when he knows or had good reason to believe\nthat criminal proceedings are imminent. The test is whether the\ncircumstances in which the alleged contemnor makes statements are\nsuch, that a person of ordinary prudence would be of opinion that\ncriminal proceedings would soon be launched.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1010328\" id=\"span_188\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"115501094\" id=\"span_189\">It is submitted that the\ndoctrine of imminent proceedings, as <a href=\"/doc/203322/\" id=\"a_226\">laid down in</a> this decision has been\naccepted in the subsequent decisions, namely, <a href=\"/doc/115501094/\" id=\"a_227\">Sahara Real Estate\nCorporation Ltd.</a> (supra), <a href=\"/doc/1010328/\" id=\"a_228\">State of Bihar vs. Shanker Lal Khirwal and\nAnr</a>, reported in 1960 SCC OnLine Pat 199, Sushil Sharma vs. the\nState (Delhi Admin.)</span></span> and Ors, reported in ILR (1997) 1 Delhi, Court on\nits own motion vs. the Publisher, Times of India Chandigarh and\nOrs., reported in 2013 SCC OnLine P&amp;H 6997, Swatanter Kumar vs.\nthe Indian Express Ltd. and Ors., (2014) SCC OnLine Del. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"72420655\" id=\"span_190\">210 and\n<a href=\"/doc/72420655/\" id=\"a_229\">Devangana Kalita vs. Delhi Police</a>, reported in 2020 SCC OnLine\nDel.867.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"203322\" id=\"span_191\">It is submitted that the doctrine of imminent proceedings\nenunciated in <a href=\"/doc/203322/\" id=\"a_230\">A.K.

The essence of\n<a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_236\">Article 19(1) (a)</a> will be lost. The existence of <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_237\">Article 19(2)</a> is a sufficient\nfetter on unrestricted use and abuse of <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_238\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the\nConstitution of India. It is submitted that there is a thin line between\nfree speech and unlawful activity which may lead to obstruction in the\nadministration of justice. Thus, the contours need to be defined.

It is submitted that there is sufficient regulatory framework\nin place for regulating electronic media which primarily consists of\n&quot;statutory regulation&quot; and &quot;self regulation&quot;. The statutory regulatory\nframework is contained, inter-alia, in the CTVN Act and the Rules\nframed   thereunder    read   with   the   Up-linking    and    Down-linking\nguidelines for the TV channels. It is submitted that compliance with the\nProgramme Code is mandatory. As regards self regulatory framework, it\nis submitted that such framework in respect of news channels which\nhas been recognized and accepted by several judicial pronouncements\ntakes place through the News Broadcasters Association and the News\nBroadcasting Federation. It is submitted that in addition to the above,\nan aggrieved person has a right to approach the Courts and seek relief\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_193\">                                    122</span>\n                                                    Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\nin terms of defamation or affecting the administration of justice in the\ncontempt jurisdiction. It is submitted that the UOI has considered the\nseveral authoritative pronouncements of the Supreme Court and has\nvoluntarily imposed a self restraint on itself in favour of the mechanism\nof self- regulation. This, however, does not and cannot mean that the\nUOI has abdicated its duty.    The UOI has the power to regulate and\npenalise violations of the Programme Code and has been exercising the\npower to penalise the TV channels. TV Channels have even been\nsuspended in the past and multiple actions have been taken; as also,\nadvisories have been regularly issued by the Ministry.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_218\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"115501094\" id=\"span_194\">145.        It is submitted that such regulatory mechanism seeks to\npenalise the actual broadcast and not a proposed broadcast, in\naccordance with the dictum of the decision of Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/115501094/\" id=\"a_239\">Sahara\nIndia Real Estate Corpn. Ltd.</a> (supra). This would also not mean that\nthe period during which a channel or programme is being telecast in\nviolation of the Programme Code is free to run the same subject only on\nfear of admonishment in future. As held by the Courts, action can be\ntaken by the Authorised Officer under the CTVN Act, namely, by the\nDistrict Magistrate or the Police in terms of <a href=\"/doc/128102/\" id=\"a_240\">section 19</a> or by the higher\njudiciary by way of contempt proceedings or proceedings seeking\ninjunction in case of defamation etc. It is submitted that to ensure that\nthe freedom of press is not fettered by the Government and media\ncontinues to act as a pillar of democracy, the present system as evolved.\nHence, it is not as if the field is unregulated. The argument that the\nfield is unregulated is said to have been waived by the petitioners who\nassert that there is an abdication of failure by the Government to\nexercise its powers. Hence, there is no need for framing of guidelines or\nregulations and the same has also been held by several judicial\npronouncements.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_219\">146.        It is next submitted that there is no failure to exercise power\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_195\">                                      123</span>\n                                                       Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\nor any abdication of duty, as the UOI is acting in accordance with the\nsaid mechanism identified and has not breached or abdicated any of its\nduty. If the UOI is of the opinion that there are violations, which have\nnot been addressed or even otherwise, it may exercise its power. The\nargument of abdication and failure fail to recognise two crucial and\nsignificant aspects, namely, the aggrieved persons or affected persons\nhave till date not complained or made any protest that the broadcasts\nhave   affected   their   rights   and   secondly,   pre-censorship      is   not\npermissible and hence, the Government acts on the basis of the actual\npublication. A delicate balancing of the right of the media and press as\nagainst the rights of the affected individuals is required to be brought\nabout. There cannot be a straight-jacket formula in such cases and each\ncase would be required to be tested on its own merits. A broad-brush\nmechanism would impinge upon the freedom of the press and affect a\npillar of democracy. Hence, Courts have always guarded against over\nregulation of the media but emphasized the need for a case to case\nanalysis. It is submitted that moreover the UOI although has dealt with\nthe issue as raised by the petitioners, however, the UOI has objection to\nthe maintainability of the petition on the ground that the petitioners are\nnot the aggrieved persons and hence they cannot approach the Court\nand on this ground itself the petitions are liable to be dismissed.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_220\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"115501094\" id=\"span_196\">147.        It is submitted that the case of abdication of duty by the\nMinistry is not a case pleaded in any Petition. In fact, all petitions\nproceeded on the basis that there is a lack of statutory and/or\nregulatory framework. This case of abdication has been urged in oral\narguments and the petitioners have sought to raise this ground in their\nadditional affidavits/rejoinder affidavits. Detailed submissions are made\non the statutory framework as contained in the CTVN Act and the Rules\nthereunder as also in the Policy guidelines for Up-linking and\nDownlinking TV channels in India. It is submitted that this statutory\nmechanism has been recognized on multiple occasions as being a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_197\">                                    124</span>\n                                                    Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\nsufficient statutory framework by the Courts including the Supreme\nCourt.

It is submitted that whilst any acts which would affect the\nadministration of justice can be prevented by the High Courts and the\nSupreme Court by exercising their inherent powers of contempt\njurisdiction, the argument of the PIL petitioner to the effect that section\n3(2) of the CoC Act must be declared to mean that it applies from the\nstage of registration of FIR ought to be rejected. The said contention\ncompletely negates and renders nugatory the &#x27;Explanation&#x27; to section\n3(2) of the CoC Act and hence, such an exercise would be impermissible.\nIt is thus contended that there is sufficient statutory legal framework in\nplace, which not only establishes the Programme Code and makes\nbroadcasts contrary thereto impermissible and illegal but several\nmechanisms of enforcement for such wrongful broadcasts are also\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_203\">                                     125</span>\n                                                     Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\nprovided for in addition to the self regulatory mechanism, the\nimportance of which has been upheld by the Supreme Court. To support\nthis submission, reliance is placed on the decision of Supreme Court in\n<a href=\"/doc/169453366/\" id=\"a_248\">Destruction of Public and Private Properties</a> (supra) and more\nparticularly to the observations as made in paragraph 30 to paragraph\n32 of the decision recognizing a self- regulatory mechanism, namely, the\nrecommendations of the Committee of Shri.

Thereafter there was haphazard mushrooming of\nnetworks in India. On 29 September 1994 the Cable Television Networks\n(Regulations) Ordinance was promulgated by the President of India as\nalso the Cable Television Networks (Regulations) Bill was introduced\nbefore the Parliament. On 25 March 1995, the CTVN Act, was passed\nand notified with a view to regulate the operation of cable television\nnetworks in the country and for matters connected therewith or\nincidental thereto. The CTVN Act was to regulate the operation of the\ncable television networks and not the broadcasters. It is submitted that\nin the year 1995, the Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/539407/\" id=\"a_255\">Cricket Association of Bengal</a>\n(supra), observed that the airwaves which are used for the purposes of\ntelecom and broadcasting services, constitute public property and must\nbe utilized for advancing public good. It was also held that the airwaves\ncan be used for the purpose of broadcasting only when allowed to do so\nby a statute or in accordance with the statute. In the year 1997,          in\npursuance of <a href=\"/doc/539407/\" id=\"a_256\">the said judgment</a> of the Supreme Court, the Government\nof India decided to create two authorities namely, the Telecom\nRegulatory Authority of India ( hereafter the &quot;TRAI&quot; for short) and the\nBroadcasting Regulatory Authority of India (BRAI). In the year 1997, the\n<a href=\"/doc/1171314/\" id=\"a_257\">Telecom Regulatory Authority of India Act</a> (&#x27;<a href=\"/doc/1171314/\" id=\"a_258\">TRAI Act</a>&#x27;) was passed with a\nview to regulate the telecommunication service which at the relevant\ntime was telecom service only.    <a href=\"/doc/148112816/\" id=\"a_259\">Section 2(1)(k)</a> as it existed in 1997,\nexcluded broadcasting services. At the time when <a href=\"/doc/1171314/\" id=\"a_260\">TRAI Act</a> was passed,\nthe broadcasting industry was developing in such a way that there\nseemed no immediate or urgent need for a legislation such as the <a href=\"/doc/1171314/\" id=\"a_261\">TRAI\nAct</a> and till date no significant step towards the same has been\nconsidered.</span>\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_212\">                                     128</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_228\">                                                       Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_229\">153.

In the definition of &quot;telecommunication service&quot;, the\namendment allowed the Central Government to notify other services to\nbe Telecommunication Service including Broadcasting Services.                The\nCTVN      Act was also amended with effect from 1 September 2000,\nthereby adding the definition of &quot;Authorized Officer&quot; and cognizance of\noffences to be taken upon a complaint by the Authorized Officer, and\nmost importantly amended <a href=\"/doc/1367921/\" id=\"a_264\">sections 19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1882460/\" id=\"a_265\">20</a> of the Act, allowing the\nAuthorized Officer/Central Government to prohibit transmission of\nprogrammes and operation of the CTVN Act, channels in public interest\nor in the event, the same was found to be not in conformity with the\nprogramme/ advertisement code. It is submitted that another set of\namendments was carried out in the CTVN Act and most importantly the\ncontravention of Section 4A was made a cognizable offence.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_230\">154.

In the year 2006, the\nBroadcasting Services Regulation Bill of 2006 was promulgated,\nhowever, the same was never passed by the Parliament. The Bill came to\nreplace both <a href=\"/doc/1171314/\" id=\"a_267\">TRAI Act</a> for the purposes of broadcasting and CTVN Act.\nAgain in the year 2006, the CTVN          Rules including Rule 6 of the\nProgramme Code and Rule 7 of the Advertising Code, were substantially\namended and the Code for self regulation in advertising as adopted by\nthe    Advertising   Standard   Council   of   India   was   given    statutory\nrecognition by incorporation of Rule 7(9) in the 1994 Rules. In the year\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_213\">                                         129</span>\n                                                       Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\n2007, the CTVN          Act was further amended and thereafter further\namended in the year 2011 to allow the transmission of programmes\nthrough Digital Addressable Systems (DAS), and the powers to seize and\nconfiscate equipment, power to make rules were also amended, keeping\nin view the changes in the technology from time to time. It is submitted\nthat keeping in view the aforesaid history and development of guidelines\nin respect of content available on television channels, the safeguards\nand powers available with various authorities and courts, can be divided\ninto   three    heads    namely   (1)    Safeguards   which    would     be    (a)\nConstitutional Safeguards, (b) Statutory Safeguards, and (c) Self\nRegulatory Mechanism; (2)         Pre Publication Injunction in case of\ninterference with the administration of justice; and (3) Pre Publication\nInjunction in case of defamation.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_231\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"82461587\" id=\"span_214\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"110813550\" id=\"span_215\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"243002\" id=\"span_216\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"456839\" id=\"span_217\">155.

It is observed that the norms to regulate the media and to raise\nits professional standard must come from inside, thereby in a way\naccepting the self regulation mechanism of the broadcasting industry.\nAlso power to the Court to injunct or postpone a publication was\navailable considering <a href=\"/doc/927019/\" id=\"a_276\">Article 129</a> and <a href=\"/doc/207538/\" id=\"a_277\">Article 215</a> of the Constitution of\nIndia which was held to be wider than the definition of criminal\ncontempt under <a href=\"/doc/231480/\" id=\"a_278\">Section 2(c)</a> of the Contempt of Courts Act. The\nSupreme Court was considering the width of the postponement orders\nand to balance the curtailment right under <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_279\">Article 19(2)</a> with the\nConstitutional protection under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_280\">Article 21</a> namely of fair trial and\nopenness of trial, the Supreme Court propounded a principle of real and\nsubstantial risk of prejudice to the proper administration of justice or\nfairness of trial.

In regard to the question as to how the reporting by media\naffects the investigation by the investigating authority, it is submitted\nthat like a law officer or a judge are unlikely to get affected by media\nreporting, the same equally applies to an investigating agency, more so\nas the investigating agency is fully bound by the procedures provided in\nthe <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_299\">Criminal Procedure Code</a>.

It would also be right to presume that the\nwitness is also made aware of the consequences/safeguards provided in\nlaw, in the event the witness refrains from the truth or turns hostile or\nhis/her credibility is questioned etc.     It is therefore, difficult to state\nwhether media reporting on an ongoing investigation is capable of\ninfluencing a witness or can influence his/her mind in the investigation\nprocess.

It is thus not necessary for this Court to issue additional\nsubstantive guidelines in relation to media coverage on criminal\ninvestigation. It is submitted that this Court may consider to clarify and\nlay down a law around the following issue:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_85\">       i.

On behalf of the NBA, detailed submissions are made in\nregard to existing legal framework as contained under the CTVN Act and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_233\">                                       137</span>\n                                                       Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\nthe CTVN Rules, to submit that a robust framework of statutory\nmechanism under the CTVN Act 1995 and CTVN Rules exist. Under this\nframework every channel should adhere to the Programme Code as\nreferred to in rule 6 and the relevant clauses being (a), (d), (f), (g), (i) and\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_250\">(k) may apply to scenarios where media coverage (or &#x27;trial by media&#x27;) may\nhave adverse consequences for ongoing criminal investigations. It is\nsubmitted that significantly none of these provisions are restricted in\ntheir application to any stage of the criminal justice process and they\nwill apply to cover coverage from the moment a FIR is registered on a\ncomplaint or arrest, till conviction or appeal, as well as the stages before\nand after this process. It is submitted that these prohibitions are not\nwithout teeth and sufficient provisions are made under the CTVN Act, to\nattract serious consequences for television channels. In this regard, a\nreference is made to <a href=\"/doc/12498/\" id=\"a_307\">section 11</a> which is a power to seize equipment\nused for operating cable television network. <a href=\"/doc/404706/\" id=\"a_308\">Section 16</a> provides for\npunishment for contravention of the provisions of the CTVN Act.\n<a href=\"/doc/1367921/\" id=\"a_309\">Section 19</a> provides for power to prohibit transmission of certain\nprogrammes in public interest. It is submitted that the MI&amp;B has\nregularly enforced these provisions by issuance of advisories, warnings,\nand orders. It is also submitted that there is no analogue in any other\nsector of media where a regulatory violation attracts a wholesale\nban/blackout. Where such an order is issued, a television channel is\nessentially asked to cease all operations and sever all sources of revenue\nfor a prescribed period. Hence, there is no regulatory or enforcement\nvacuum from the point of view of the statutory framework.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_251\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1896811\" id=\"span_234\">169.         It is next submitted that the regulatory framework is\nsupplemented by wide powers that courts possess to punish parties who\nact in their contempt. Referring to section 2(c) of the CoC Act, which\ndefines criminal contempt, it is urged that the &quot;Explanation&quot; to section 3\nof the CoC Act, clarifies that in relation to criminal matters, a judicial\nproceeding is said to be pending: (i) where it relates to the commission of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_235\">                                      138</span>\n                                                      Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\nan offence, when the charge-sheet or challan is filed, or when the court\nissues summons or warrant, as the case may be, against the accused,\nand (ii) in any other case, when the court takes cognizance of the matter\nto which the proceeding relates. Although it is argued that the powers of\nthe Court under the CoC Act do not apply in relation to criminal matter\nat a pre-chargesheet stage, however, such a view is erroneous, as it is\nmade clear by the text of the &#x27;Explanation&#x27;. This definition only applies\nin relation to conduct which may attract contempt under <a href=\"/doc/1257958/\" id=\"a_310\">section 2(c)(ii)</a>\nof the Act, which relates to judicial proceedings. As a whole, <a href=\"/doc/529114/\" id=\"a_311\">section 3</a>\n(and the Explanation thereto) has limited significance in relation to\ndefining the sweep of contempt under <a href=\"/doc/1257958/\" id=\"a_312\">section 2(c)</a>. To support such\ncontention, reliance is placed on the decision of the Supreme Court in\n<a href=\"/doc/1896811/\" id=\"a_313\">Rachapudi Subba Rao vs. Advocate General, Andhra Pradesh</a>,\nreported in (1981) 2 SCC 577, wherein the Supreme Court has observed\non the narrow scope of section 3 of the CoC Act to hold that the phrase\n&quot;the administration of justice in any other manner&quot; used in <a href=\"/doc/1257958/\" id=\"a_314\">section\n2(c)(iii)</a> has been substituted in <a href=\"/doc/597993/\" id=\"a_315\">section 3(1)</a> by the narrower phrase &quot;the\ncourse of justice in connection with any civil or criminal proceeding\npending at the time of publication.&quot; It is submitted that no case can be\nmade out that this Explanation in any way applies to restrict the scope\nof <a href=\"/doc/1257958/\" id=\"a_316\">section 2(c)(iii)</a> of the Act, which is significantly broader and relates to\nthe &quot;administration of justice&quot; as a whole, and that &quot;administration of\njustice&quot; is a broad term which not only relates to the pending judicial\nproceedings but to a wide spectrum of activities involved in the judicial\nsystem.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1896811\" id=\"span_236\">This has also been explained in paragraph 14 of the decision in\n<a href=\"/doc/1896811/\" id=\"a_317\">Rachapudi Subba Rao</a> (supra).</span>\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_252\">170.        It is next submitted that &quot;administration of justice&quot; in <a href=\"/doc/1257958/\" id=\"a_318\">section\n2(c)(iii)</a>, when interpreted purposively, must be understood to include\nany matter which can affect the administration of justice at any stage of\nthe criminal process. Excessive publicity, leakage of evidence, and\nvilifying coverage can affect public confidence in the judicial system even\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_237\">                                    139</span>\n                                                    Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\nat the earliest stages of the criminal process. Hence, it could not have\nbeen the intent of Parliament that the CoC Act would only address\nmischiefs arising subsequent to charge-sheet under this clause. This\nrule of interpretation has been well-entrenched through several\ndecisions of the Supreme Court. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"608874\" id=\"span_238\">In this context, reliance is placed on the\ndecision of the Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/608874/\" id=\"a_319\">Bengal Immunity Co. vs. State of\nBihar</a>, reported in AIR 1955 SC 661, to canvass the principle of\ninterpretation required to be followed would be as <a href=\"/doc/608874/\" id=\"a_320\">laid down in</a> Heydon&#x27;s\ncase. It is submitted that applying this approach, it must be concluded\nthat &quot;administration of justice&quot; must be understood to include all\npossible influences and threats which may pollute the stream of justice.\nIt would include conduct from the commission of the crime onwards. It\nis hence   submitted that even if pre-chargesheet stage matters would\nnot be pending judicial proceedings for the purposes of section 2(c)(ii) of\nthe CoC Act, they would be covered by the much broader and &#x27;residuary&#x27;\nclause, namely <a href=\"/doc/1257958/\" id=\"a_321\">section 2(c)(iii)</a>. As a result, the court would be\nsufficiently empowered in its discretion under the CoC Act to initiate\ncriminal contempt where any conduct may affect &quot;administration of\njustice&quot;. This would equally apply in cases of adverse consequences of\nexcessive media coverage of pre-chargesheet criminal investigations. It is\nsubmitted that as there is no direct authority on this point to the\nknowledge of the respondent, this Court may consider laying down the\nlaw in this regard.</span>\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_253\">171.        It is next submitted that there are remedies under inherent\nContempt Jurisdiction of the high courts and the Supreme Court. The\npowers of the high courts under <a href=\"/doc/207538/\" id=\"a_322\">Article 215</a> and under <a href=\"/doc/927019/\" id=\"a_323\">Articles 129</a> and\n<a href=\"/doc/500307/\" id=\"a_324\">142</a> of the Supreme Court to punish for contempt cannot be in any\nmanner restricted by statute. Such powers are plenary in nature and\nthey occupy a different plane. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1401520\" id=\"span_239\">In this context reliance is placed on the\ndecision of the Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/1401520/\" id=\"a_325\">Pritam Pal vs. High</a> Court of Madhya\nPradesh, reported in 1993 Supp (1) SCC 529, in which the Supreme\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_240\">                                     140</span>\n                                                      Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\nCourt taking a review of the several decisions, has held that power of the\nSupreme Court and the high courts being the Courts of Record as\nembodied under <a href=\"/doc/927019/\" id=\"a_326\">Articles 129</a> and <a href=\"/doc/207538/\" id=\"a_327\">215</a> of the Constitution, respectively\ncannot be restricted and trammelled by any ordinary legislation\nincluding the provisions of the CoC Act and their inherent power is\nelastic, unfettered and not subjected to any limit.</span>\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_254\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"115501094\" id=\"span_241\">172.

It is submitted that\nthese are cases where courts, comprehending that the conduct of the\npolice or media may compromise the pre-chargesheet criminal justice\nprocess, took action under their inherent powers to protect the\nadministration of justice. It is thus submitted that the high courts and\nthe Supreme Court possess wide powers to take preventive as well as\npunitive measures in exercise of contempt jurisdiction under the\nConstitution. This would be without prejudice to the extant powers\navailable under the CoC Act and such powers may be exercised where\ncourts apprehend any interference with the administration of justice.\nThere is nothing to prevent these powers being extended to pre-\nchargesheet matters in the context of criminal proceedings.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_256\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"115501094\" id=\"span_245\">174.        It is then submitted that adjunct to the breadth of the\ninherent powers of the high courts and the Supreme Court, is its\nsubsumption of the common law of contempt. It is submitted that the\ndevelopment of the common law of contempt demonstrates that this\nfacet is capable of being adapted effectively to prevent any threat or\npotential threat to the administration of justice. There is now little doubt\nthat the common law supplements the powers under the CoC Act and\nthe broad inherent powers of the constitutional courts. What was\nimplicit is now explicit by the decision of the Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/115501094/\" id=\"a_334\">Sahara\nIndia Real Estate Corp.

It is thus submitted that the common law of\ncontempt forms part of the jurisprudence, that the high courts or the\nSupreme Court may draw upon in addressing any matter which may\naffect the administration of justice. It is also clear from the examination\nof development of the common law that it clearly confers powers upon\ncourts to address any matter that may affect the administration of\njustice ~ including those at the preliminary stages of the criminal justice\nprocess.</span> In this context, a reference is made to the decision of the\nQueen&#x27;s Bench in Attorney General vs. News Group Newspapers Plc.,\nreported in (1989) Q.B. 110, where the Court was asked to consider if\ncontempt, at common law, could only extend to &quot;active proceedings&quot; or\nthose that were imminent. It was held that the common law is not a\nworn-out jurisprudence rendered incapable of further development by\nthe ever-increasing incursion of Parliamentary legislation. It is a lively\nbody of law capable of adaptation and expansion to meet fresh needs\ncalling for the exertion of the discipline of law. A reference is also made\nto the decision of the Court of Appeal in Jet 2 Holidays Ltd. vs.\nHughes and Anr., reported in (2019) EWCA Civ 1858, where the Court\nhas held that it is well established that an act may be a contempt of\ncourt even though carried out before proceedings have begun.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_257\">175.

It is asserted that the law of contempt is versatile and is\nmeant to be extended to cover even novel scenarios, and is not static.\nThus, the Court may clarify and lay down the law on this point in the\nIndian context. Also, there are remedies under <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_338\">the Code of Civil\nProcedure</a>,   1908.

A reference in this regard is made to the provisions of\n<a href=\"/doc/534484/\" id=\"a_341\">sections 182</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1905297/\" id=\"a_342\">192</a>, <a href=\"/doc/162723/\" id=\"a_343\">202</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1096902/\" id=\"a_344\">203</a> and <a href=\"/doc/172919/\" id=\"a_345\">211</a> of the IPC, which are provisions\nillustrative of punitive responses to scenarios where third parties tend to\npervert the course of criminal justice. These are the provisions which are\nequally applicable to account for excesses by the media, or other third\nparties, in relation to the coverage of criminal investigations or\nproceedings. None of these provisions are restricted to applying to any\nspecific stage of the criminal justice process.

In regard to the self regulatory remedies, it is submitted that\nthe news media is also subject to self-regulation under the authority of\nthe NBSA, the Chairperson of which is a retired judge of the Supreme\nCourt of India. The Chairperson is assisted by four eminent persons\nwith special knowledge in various fields, as well as four eminent editors\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_251\">                                     144</span>\n                                                     Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\nemployed with broadcasters. The NBSA considers complaints against\nMembers and Associate Members for violations of the &quot;Code of Ethics &amp;\nBroadcasting Standards&quot; of the NBA. This Code enumerates several\nfundamental principles to be followed by news channels including in\nrelation to impartiality and objectivity, neutrality, and safeguards to\nensure that violence and crime are not glorified. The Code is applicable\nin all situations. It is submitted that since its establishment in 2008, the\nNBSA has received total 3975 complaints, which includes complaints\nreceived at the first level of redressal and complaints received at the\nsecond level of redressal. NBSA has passed 106 orders/decisions. Fines\nwere issued in total 14 cases.

In regard to the question that fine of Rs. One Lakh which\nmay be levied by the NBSA may not be adequate, it is submitted that the\nfine is without prejudice to any other remedies that may lie against an\nerring news channel. It is submitted that news channels found in\nviolation of the Code are required to display prominent apologies, which\noccupy a large portion of the screen at prime time and would read aloud\nserving as a robust deterrent as well as punitive measure to check\nagainst media excesses. In actuality, the apologies not only hurt the\ncredibility of a channel but also have adverse commercial consequences\nin that they last for at least one minute or more depending on the text\nduring a prime time telecast.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_261\">179.

It is thus submitted that where the Supreme Court as well\nas the Central Government, has expressed a clear preference to the\nmodel of self-regulation, it may not be appropriate for this Court to\nrevisit or disturb this status quo. In regard to the petitioners&#x27; contention\nthat there is need for issuance of guidelines by this Court, it is\nsubmitted that the field of regulation vis-a-vis news channels is\noccupied by several robust and overlapping frameworks to check against\nand, if necessary, punish the abuse and hence, it is not appropriate for\nthis Court to provide additional substantive guidelines on this matter. It\nis necessary that there is an effective balance that preserves the\ncherished fundamental right to free speech and expression but prevents\nits abuse, and checks the violation of the right to privacy and damage to\nreputation of persons before and during any civil and criminal\nproceedings is maintained. Any guidelines laid down may apply\nregardless of whether the concerned news channel is a member of any\nself-regulatory mechanism, and that efforts shall be taken to bring more\nchannels within the self-regulatory fold.

At the outset, it is submitted that the case of the petitioners\nthat guidelines be issued on media reporting from the stage of\nregistration of FIR till the filing of the charge-sheet, needs to be rejected.\nAny such restriction on reporting by media, would tantamount to no\ncrime ever being reported and would amount to silencing of the press. It\nwould also infringe upon the pubic rights to be informed and would also\noverride and nullify rights of the victims and their families. This kind of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_256\">                                    147</span>\n                                                      Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\nmedia control ought not to emanate from the facts of one case and\nwould not bode well for democracy. Such restrictions on the right of the\npress are unprecedented and disproportionate in the facts of the present\ncase. It would be an anathema to the rule of law to state that there can\never be restrictions or an embargo on reporting the truth or the\nsuppressed facts in a matter of public importance. If such blanket\nprotection is granted to the Government and its instrumentalities, it\nwould give rise to brazen abuse of power. The police would have\nunbridled powers and stature would be protected from any legal\nconsequences. It may also lead to numerous crimes being brushed\nunder the carpet, tardy investigation and other chilling ramifications. It\nis submitted that such control of media can only exist in an ideal State.\nIllustratively incidences like custodial death, police brutality, misuse of\npower and corruption, are realities faced by a common citizen everyday\nwhich requires a vibrant and robust press.     It is hence submitted that\nthe entire media cannot be silenced for the protection of a few people. If\nat all, the line is crossed in reporting by any media organization, there\nare enough remedies in law for the protection of the aggrieved party.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_265\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"362532\" id=\"span_257\">182.        At the further outset in regard to the petitions filed by\nMahesh Narayan Singh &amp; others and Nilesh Navlakha &amp; others, it is\nsubmitted that the petitioners have no locus standi to file these petitions\nas they are neither accused persons nor aggrieved persons whose right\nto fair trial have been allegedly curtailed in any manner by any\npublications   made   by   the   media    channels.     To   support      these\nsubmissions, reliance is placed on the decision of the Supreme Court in\n<a href=\"/doc/362532/\" id=\"a_348\">R&amp;M Trust vs. Koramangla Residents Vigilance Group</a>, reported in\n(2005) 3 SCC 91).

Also, the Supreme Court has\nheld that preventive relief of postponement of publication can be availed\nonly by any accused or any aggrieved person who apprehends that a\nparticular publication has real and substantial risk of prejudicing the\nproper administration of justice or the fairness of his or her trial. This\nmore particularly when none of the petitioners are directly or indirectly\nrelated to the cause the petitioners canvassed in the petitions, namely,\nthe death of an actor.</span>    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"115501094\" id=\"span_259\">Hence, applying the test as <a href=\"/doc/362532/\" id=\"a_350\">laid down by</a> the\nSupreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/115501094/\" id=\"a_351\">Sahara India Real Estate Corporation Limited</a>\n(supra), the petitions ought not to be entertained.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_266\">183.

The petitioners have alleged disputed questions of fact and\nlack any exceptional circumstances warranting interference by this\nCourt.

Such efforts have brought to light matters of grave concern\nin the interest to the society at large. Even in the past, the Courts have\ntime and again recognized the legitimacy of instances wherein\ninvestigative journalism has been pivotal to reveal issues which pertain\nto a larger cause and serve public interest.

The debates, which are carried out\non the issue in question by the respondent No.8, are strictly in\nconformity with the provisions of the CTVN Act and the Rules and such\nbroadcasts and debates are also in consonance with Programme Code\nprescribed thereunder and do not violate any provisions of the CTVN Act\nand the Rules.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_267\">184.

In regard to the petitioners&#x27; allegation of violation of various\nprovisions of the CTVN Act and the Rules framed thereunder by the\nrespondent No.8, it is submitted that media reporting on the death of\nthe actor has been a long fight of more than 47 days for investigative\njournalism by the media and that has unearthed a pile of evidence in\nthe case and the media has played a key role to use its skill in\ninvestigative    journalism   to   bring     key     testimonies,       evidence,\ncorroborations    and   inconsistencies    into    the   public    domain.

A legislative bill drafted by this Committee\nunderwent many changes and ultimately, when the bill was introduced\nin the Rajya Sabha, a motion for reference to a Joint Committee of the\nHouses was adopted on 27th November 1968. The Lok Sabha adopted\nthe motion on 14th December 1968. Another Joint Committee (the\nBargava Committee) made a detailed inquiry and submitted its report on\n20th February 1970.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_277\">193.

As in\n            the case of pending proceedings, if a person is able to\n            prove that he has no reasonable grounds for believing\n            that the proceeding is imminent, it should completely\n            absolve him from any liability for contempt of court.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_278\">            Perhaps such a defence is already available to an alleged\n            contemner, but we would prefer to give it statutory\n            expression particularly as under English law, from which\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_268\">                                       153</span>\n                                                          Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\n            our law of contempt is derived, lack of knowledge would\n            not excuse a contempt though it may have a bearing on\n            the punishment to be inflicted. We would also like to go a\n            little   further   and     provide   for   certain       additional\n            safeguards. It has been observed in several cases that\n            once a person is arrested it would be legitimate to infer\n            that proceedings are imminent. But in actual fact that\n            result may not invariably follow. We have already said\n            that it should be a valid defence for an alleged contemner\n            to prove that he had no reasonable grounds for believing\n            that a proceeding was imminent. To this we would like to\n            add that where no arrest has been made a presumption\n            should be drawn in favour of an alleged contemner that\n            no proceedings are imminent.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_279\">            The Sanyal committee concluded as follows:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_95\">            &quot;Chapter XII-Conclusion:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_96\">             &quot;(8) The rule of contempt in relation to imminent\n             proceedings may be abolished so far as civil cases are\n             concerned.

It is submitted that the media&#x27;s interest in a case is whether\nthe same is being investigated or not. A pending case or any court\nproceedings cannot be equated with media trial.

It is next submitted\nthat &#x27;investigative journalism&#x27; would entitle the media to ascertain the\nfacts and report on them. It is part of the fundamental duty of a\njournalist to place facts in the public domain. The fact that the Supreme\nCourt and various High Courts, at times, refer cases to Special\nInvestigation Teams/Central Bureau of Investigation, etc. itself shows\nthat every investigation cannot be presumed to be fair and untainted.

It is submitted that the media&#x27;s right and duty to\nproject exchange of idea and opinions is not only necessary in a\ndemocracy, it would be entitled to the highest protection and freedom\nfrom State interference. The media is entitled not only to embark on\ninvestigative exercise as part of its duty to confer information to the\npublic but also to project its views as editorial decisions in respect of\nevents. The media has right to criticize and present their version of\nevents, even though the public or certain sections of it may not agree\nwith these views. It is seen that in the present case even otherwise,\nmany debates on the electronic media are live streamed, where views are\nexpressed by various panelists and many of these views may be\nunpalatable to the Government and exercise of coercive rights over the\nmedia would be highly detrimental. It is the duty of the media to report\nagainst Government action/inaction including the role of investigation\nagencies in various cases. In particular, instrumentalities of the State\nare always open to criticism and comments by the media, including\ninvestigation agencies. It is submitted that the CBI, which has been\nentrusted with the investigation, has not complained of any interference\nby the media.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_289\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"115501094\" id=\"span_280\">203.

The recommendation of the Sanyal\nCommittee that proceedings being &quot;imminent&quot; (i.e. before arrest) would\nbe the starting point for pendency was not accepted. It is only for\ninterference/obstruction in the course of justice for pending criminal\nproceedings (upon filing of chargesheet or challan) that the CoC Act can\nbe attracted.

Chandrima Das</a>, reported in (2000) 2\nSCC 465, the Supreme Court was considering a civil appeal wherein an\norder passed by the Calcutta High Court on a writ petition instituted by\nan advocate in public interest was under challenge. A foreign national\nwas gangraped in a &#x27;yatri niwas&#x27; at Howrah railway station and the\npetitioning    advocate   had    sought    for   diverse   relief   including\ncompensation for the victim. The High Court while making a slew of\ndirections, inter alia, granted Rs.10 lakh as compensation to be paid to\nthe victim by the Railway. The only question that the Supreme Court\nwas urged to consider was, whether the Railway could be made liable to\npay compensation to a victim and that too to a foreign national, without\nthe perpetrators of the crime being fastened with such liability. The\nCourt traced its earlier decisions on the distinction between &#x27;public law\nremedy&#x27; and &#x27;private law remedy&#x27; and cases where compensation was\ngranted to victims of medical negligence and to the next of kin of under-\ntrials/accused suffering custodial death even on a petition under Article\n32/226 of the Constitution. Ultimately, the objection that the petitioning\nadvocate had no locus standi to approach the High Court was overruled.\nCertain passages from the decision throw light on the development of\nlaw in India in relation to petitions instituted in public interest and we\nconsider it useful to reproduce the same for our guidance:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_111\">       &quot;15.

The Court further observed\n       that public-spirited citizens having faith in the rule of law are\n       rendering great social and legal service by espousing causes of\n       public nature.

A passage from the decision of the Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/304068/\" id=\"a_401\">LIC vs.\nManubhai D. Shah (Prof.</a>), reported in (1992) 3 SCC 637, brings out the\nflavour of the right to freedom of free speech and expression, so very\nrelevant in the present context. It reads:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_121\">       &quot;8. The words &#x27;freedom of speech and expression&#x27; must, therefore,\n       be broadly construed to include the freedom to circulate one&#x27;s\n       views by words of mouth or in writing or through audio-visual\n       instrumentalities. It, therefore, includes the right to propagate\n       one&#x27;s views through the print media or through any other\n       communication channel e.g. the radio and the television. Every\n       citizen of this free country, therefore, has the right to air his or her\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_304\">                                      169</span>\n                                                       Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\n       views through the printing and/or the electronic media subject of\n       course to permissible restrictions imposed under <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_402\">Article 19(2)</a> of\n       the Constitution. The print media, the radio and the tiny screen\n       play the role of public educators, so vital to the growth of a\n       healthy democracy. Freedom to air one&#x27;s views is the lifeline of any\n       democratic institution and any attempt to stifle, suffocate or gag\n       this right would sound a death-knell to democracy and would help\n       usher in autocracy or dictatorship. It cannot be gainsaid that\n       modern communication mediums advance public interest by\n       informing the public of the events and developments that have\n       taken place and thereby educating the voters, a role considered\n       significant for the vibrant functioning of a democracy. Therefore,\n       in any set-up, more so in a democratic set-up like ours,\n       dissemination of news and views for popular consumption is a\n       must and any attempt to deny the same must be frowned upon\n       unless it falls within the mischief of <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_403\">Article 19(2)</a> of the\n       Constitution. It follows that a citizen for propagation of his or her\n       ideas has a right to publish for circulation his views in periodicals,\n       magazines and journals or through the electronic media since it is\n       well known that these communication channels are great\n       purveyors of news and views and make considerable impact on\n       the minds of the readers and viewers and are known to mould\n       public opinion on vital issues of national importance. Once it is\n       conceded, and it cannot indeed be disputed, that freedom of\n       speech and expression includes freedom of circulation and\n       propagation of ideas, there can be no doubt that the right extends\n       to the citizen being permitted to use the media to answer the\n       criticism levelled against the view propagated by him. Every free\n       citizen has an undoubted right to lay what sentiments he pleases\n       before the public; to forbid this, except to the extent permitted by\n       <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_404\">Article 19(2)</a>, would be an inroad on his freedom. This freedom\n       must, however, be exercised with circumspection and care must\n       be taken not to trench on the rights of other citizens or to\n       jeopardise public interest. It is manifest from <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_405\">Article 19(2)</a> that the\n       right conferred by <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_406\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> is subject to imposition of\n       reasonable restrictions in the interest of, amongst others, public\n       order, decency or morality or in relation to defamation or\n       incitement to an offence. It is, therefore, obvious that subject to\n       reasonable restrictions placed under <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_407\">Article 19(2)</a> a citizen has a\n       right to publish, circulate and disseminate his views and any\n       attempt to thwart or deny the same would offend <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_408\">Article 19(1)(a).&quot;</a>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_326\">                                           (underlining for emphasis by us)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_327\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"304068\" id=\"span_305\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"223504\" id=\"span_306\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"110813550\" id=\"span_307\">220.

The Andhra Pradesh High Court in <a href=\"/doc/124038182/\" id=\"a_418\">Labour Liberation\nFront vs. State of Andhra Pradesh</a>, reported in 2005 (1) ALT 740, had\nthe occasion to lament as follows:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_122\">       &quot;In the recent past, the freedom of the prosecuting agency, and\n       that of the Courts, to deal with the cases before them freely and\n       objectively, is substantially eroded, on account of the overactive or\n       proactive stances taken in the presentations made by the print\n       and electronic media. Once an incident involving prominent\n       person or institution takes place, the media is swinging into action\n       and virtually leaving very little for the prosecution or the Courts to\n       examine the matter. Recently, it has assumed dangerous\n       proportions, to the extent of intruding into the very privacy of\n       individuals. Gross misuse of technological advancements, and the\n       unhealthy competition in the field of journalism resulted in\n       obliteration of norms or commitment to the noble profession. The\n       freedom of speech and expression which is the bedrock of\n       journalism, is subjected to gross misuse. It must not be forgotten\n       that only those who maintain restraint can exercise rights and\n       freedoms effectively.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_330\">                                          (underlining for emphasis by us)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_311\">                                      171</span>\n                                                      Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_331\">223.

The pleaded cases in the writ petitions seek to depict the\nsituation as distressing. The principal question which we have been\nurged to answer is relatable to corrective action needed for the rule of\nlaw ~ a foundational feature of our Constitution ~ to prevail, and\nwhether guidelines to that effect ought to be given by us to guide the\nmeans for achieving the ultimate end, i.e., justice to and for all.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_333\">225.         There can be no two opinions that in a society governed by\nthe rule of law, no price is too high to maintain the purity of\nadministration of justice; and, as a Constitutional court, we have the\npower, nay the duty, to protect not only the Fundamental Rights of the\ncitizens as well as the press/media in the judicious exercise of our\njurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_419\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution but also to secure that\nthe stream of administration of justice flows unsullied and unpolluted,\nuninfluenced by extraneous considerations. Our thought process while\nanswering the questions that have emerged would centre round the said\npremise.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_334\">226.         &#x27;Freedom of speech and expression&#x27; guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_420\">Article\n19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution is said to be the life blood of our democracy.\nThe Supreme Court in its several judgments has recognized the\nimportance of such right both from the points of view of liberty of the\nindividual and the democratic form of our Government. This right\nensures free flow of opinions and ideas essential to sustain the collective\nlife of the citizenry. It is equally well acknowledged that &#x27;Freedom of the\nPress&#x27; is basically the freedom of the individuals to express themselves\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_312\">                                     172</span>\n                                                     Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\nthrough the press/media. However, the expansive and sweeping ambit\nof such freedom notwithstanding, the right to freedom of speech and\nexpression like all other rights in the Constitution is also not absolute; it\nis subject to imposition of reasonable restrictions. The restrictions that\ncan be imposed by law, as <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_421\">Article 19(2)</a> ordains, ought to be reasonable\nin the sense that any law abridging such right, if it relates to any matter\nspecified in clause (2), viz., inter alia, relating to contempt of court and\ndefamation, must pass Constitutional muster.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_335\">227.        The Supreme Court in In Re: Harijai Singh &amp; Anr, reported\nin (1996) 6 SCC 466, sounded caution in the following words:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_124\">         &quot;10. But it has to be remembered that this freedom of press is\n         not absolute, unlimited and unfettered at all times and in all\n         circumstances as giving an unrestricted freedom of speech and\n         expression would amount to an uncontrolled licence. If it were\n         wholly free even from reasonable restraints it would lead to\n         disorder and anarchy. The freedom is not to be misunderstood\n         as to be a press free to disregard its duty to be responsible. In\n         fact, the element of responsibility must be present in the\n         conscience of the journalists. In an organised society, the rights\n         of the press have to be recognised with its duties and\n         responsibilities towards the society. Public order, decency,\n         morality and such other things must be safeguarded. The\n         protective cover of press freedom must not be thrown open for\n         wrong doings. If a newspaper publishes what is improper,\n         mischievously false or illegal and abuses its liberty it must be\n         punished by court of law. The editor of a newspaper or a\n         journal has a greater responsibility to guard against untruthful\n         news and publications for the simple reason that his\n         utterances have a far greater circulation and impact than the\n         utterances of an individual and by reason of their appearing in\n         print, they are likely to be believed by the ignorant. That being\n         so, certain restrictions are essential even for preservation of the\n         freedom of the press itself. To quote from the report of Mons\n         Lopez to the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations\n         &#x27;If it is true that human progress is impossible without freedom,\n         then it is no less true that ordinary human progress is\n         impossible without a measure of regulation and discipline&#x27;. It is\n         the duty of a true and responsible journalist to strive to inform\n         the people with accurate and impartial presentation of news\n         and their views after dispassionate evaluation of the facts and\n         information received by them and to be published as a news\n         item. The presentation of the news should be truthful, objective\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_313\">                                       173</span>\n                                                         Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\n           and comprehensive        without      any     false   and     distorted\n           expression.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_336\">                                                            (italics in original)\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_337\">228.         Notwithstanding that freedom of speech is the bulwark of a\ndemocratic government and the role of the press/media to discover the\ntruth and to ensure proper functioning of the democratic process is\nundoubtedly salutary, at the same time, the press/media must\nremember that its concern for discovery of truth and maintenance of\npurity in all streams of good governance by opening up channels of free\ndiscussion of issues should stop short of exceeding the permissible legal\nand Constitutional means. Since here we are majorly concerned with\n&quot;administration of justice&quot;, any report of the press/media, having the\npropensity    of   tilting   the   balance     against    fair   and    impartial\n&quot;administration of justice&quot;, could make a mockery of the justice delivery\nsystem rendering &#x27;truth&#x27; a casualty. The duty of the press/media to have\nnews items printed/telecast based on true and correct version relating\nto     incidents   worth     reporting      accurately    and     without      any\ndistortion/embellishment as well as without taking sides, cannot\ntherefore be overemphasized.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_338\">229.

The judgment of Lord\n             Hardwicke, L.C., in Re Read &amp; Huggonson [(1742) 2 Atk 469],\n             which has always been regarded as the locus classicus on the\n             subject, declared &#x27;Nothing is more incumbent upon courts of\n             justice, than to preserve their proceedings from being\n             misrepresented; nor is there anything of more pernicious\n             consequence, than to prejudice the minds of the public\n             against persons concerned as parties in causes before the\n             cause is finally heard&#x27;. The learned Lord Chancellor\n             characterized contempt as of three kinds, namely,\n             scandalizing the court, abusing parties in court, prejudicing\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_317\">                         175</span>\n                                         Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\nmankind against parties and the court before the cause is\nheard. Adverting to the third category, which is germane to\nthe present case, the Lord Chancellor proceeded to state at p.\n471 thus:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_127\">     &#x27;There may also be a contempt of this court, in\n     prejudicing mankind against persons before the\n     cause is heard. There cannot be anything of greater\n     consequence, than to keep the streams of justice\n     clear and pure, that parties may proceed with safety\n     both to themselves and their characters.&#x27;\nBut to constitute contempt of court, in the words of Lord\nRussel, C.J., &#x27;the applicant must show that something has\nbeen published which either is clearly intended, or at least is\ncalculated, to prejudice a trial which is pending&#x27;. (See The\nQueen v. Payne, 1896 1 Q.B. 577). In The Queen v. Gray,\n1900 2 Q.B. 36, the phrase &#x27;contempt of court&#x27; is defined&#x27; as,\ninter alia, &#x27;something done calculated to obstruct or interfere\nwith the due course of justice or the lawful process of the\ncourts&#x27;. Lord Goddard, C.J., in R. v. Odham&#x27;s Press Ltd., 1956\n3 All E R 494, after considering the relevant authority on the\nsubject, laid down the following test to ascertain whether\nthere is contempt of court in a given case, at p. 497:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_128\">&#x27;The test is whether the matter complained of is calculated to\ninterfere with the course of justice....&#x27;\nWords much to the same effect were used by Parker, C.J., in\na recent decision in R. v. Duffy, 1960 2 All E R 891, when he\nstated at p. 894 that,\n&#x27;....the question in every case is whether...the article was\nintended or calculated to prejudice the fair hearing of the\nproceedings.&#x27;\nIn Halsbury&#x27;s Laws of England, 3rd Edn. Vol. 8, it is stated at\np. 8, &#x27;It is sufficient if it is clear that the comment tends to\nprejudice the trial of the action&#x27;. Adverting to the third\ncategory of contempt described by Lord Hardwicke, L.C., the\nlearned author says at p. 8 thus:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_129\">      &#x27;The effect of such misrepresentations may be not\n      only to deter persons from coming forward to give\n      evidence on one side, but to induce witnesses to give\n      evidence on the other side alone, to prejudice the\n      minds of jurors, or to cause the parties to\n      discontinue or compromise, or to deter other\n      persons with good causes of action from coming to\n      the court.&#x27;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_130\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1548900\" id=\"span_318\">27.

In P.C. Sen, In re, reported in AIR 1970 SC 1821, the\nSupreme Court was seized of an appeal carried from an order of the\nCalcutta High Court by none other than the Chief Minister of West\nBengal, whereby he was held guilty of contempt and his conduct was\ndisapproved. On the law of contempt, this is what the Court held:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_132\">          &quot;8. The law relating to contempt of Court is well settled. Any\n          act done or writing published which is calculated to bring a\n          court or a Judge into contempt, or to lower his authority, or\n          to interfere with the due course of justice or the lawful\n          process of the Court, is a contempt of Court; R.V. Gray [1900\n          2 Q.B. 36]. Contempt by speech or writing may be by\n          scandalising the Court itself, or by abusing parties to actions,\n          or by prejudicing mankind in favour of or against a party\n          before the cause is heard. It is incumbent upon Courts of\n          justice     to  preserve    their    proceedings   from    being\n          misrepresented, for prejudicing the minds of the public\n          against persons concerned as parties in causes before the\n          cause is finally heard has pernicious consequences. Speeches\n          or writings misrepresenting the proceedings of the Court or\n          prejudicing the public for or against a party or involving\n          reflections on parties to a proceeding amount to contempt. To\n          make a speech tending to influence the result of a pending\n          trial, whether civil or criminal is a grave contempt. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1533350\" id=\"span_320\">Comments\n          on pending proceedings, if emanating from the parties or their\n          lawyers, are generally a more serious contempt than those\n          coming from independent sources. The question in all cases\n          of comment on pending proceedings is not whether the\n          publication does interfere, but whether it tends to interfere,\n          with the due course of justice. The question is not so much of\n          the intention of the contemner as whether it is calculated to\n          interfere with the administration of justice. As observed by\n          the Judicial Committee in <a href=\"/doc/1533350/\" id=\"a_426\">Devi Prasad Sharma v.

The argument of counsel that intention is the\ndecisive test was overruled by holding that the sentence referred to by\nHis Lordship in the judgment of the majority did not imply that if there\nwere no intention to interfere with the course of justice no punishment\ncould be ordered.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_352\">238.        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"203322\" id=\"span_323\">In <a href=\"/doc/203322/\" id=\"a_428\">A.K.

Gopalan was not guilty of\ncontempt since no proceedings were imminent and allowed his appeal.\nHowever, the appeal of the other appellant, P. Govinda Pillai, was\ndismissed on the ground that the offending statements came to be\npublished after the arrest of an accused. It would be profitable to extract\na passage from <a href=\"/doc/203322/\" id=\"a_429\">the said decision</a>, reading thus:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_135\">           &quot;7.

In some cases no doubt, especially in cases of\n           public scandal regarding companies, it is the duty of a free\n           press to comment on such topics so as to bring them to the\n           attention of the public.

This is plainly evident from a sentence\nappearing in the minority view to the effect that &quot;the consensus of\nauthorities both in England and in India is that contempt of court may be\ncommitted by any one making a comment or publication of the\nexceptionable type if he knows or has reason to believe that proceedings\nin court though not actually begun are imminent&quot;.

Sub-clause (iii) by\nusing the expression &quot;in any other manner&quot; intends to encompass cases\nnot covered in express terms by its immediately preceding sub-clauses,\ni.e., (i) and (ii). It is, therefore, of a residuary character taking within its\ncoverage acts of contempt not attracting clauses (i) and (ii).

When we consider &quot;administration of justice&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_148\">in sub-clause (iii) bearing in mind &quot;authority of any court&quot; and &quot;due\ncourse of any judicial proceeding&quot; in sub-clauses (i) and (ii) respectively,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_328\">                                     181</span>\n                                                       Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\nthere is indeed a degree of overlap but such expression unmistakably\nappears to be much wider in its sweep than &quot;authority of any court&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_365\">and/or &quot;due course of any judicial proceeding&quot;. Although there is no\nprecise definition of &quot;administration of justice&quot;, it could be defined as the\nmeans to secure, according to law, what is just. It is obvious that\n&quot;administration of justice&quot;, in the context of criminal contempt as defined\nin the CoC Act, has a much wider overtone than either &quot;authority of any\ncourt&quot; or &quot;due course of any judicial proceeding&quot;. The legislature in its\nwisdom did not refer to &quot;due course of any judicial proceeding&quot; in sub-\nclause (iii) but designedly used &quot;administration of justice&quot;, which may\ninclude as its facet &quot;due course of any judicial proceeding&quot;, to distinguish\nsub-clause (ii) from sub-clause (iii) and to give a wider scope to the latter\nwith the result that any publication or act interfering with or tending to\ninterfere with/obstructing or tending to obstruct &quot;administration of\njustice&quot; in a manner other than what is referred to in sub-clauses (i) and\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_366\">(ii) could amount to contempt, i.e., criminal contempt, within the\nmeaning of <a href=\"/doc/491407/\" id=\"a_438\">section 2(c)(iii)</a>.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_367\">241.         Further, the expression &quot;administration of justice&quot; in section\n2(c)(iii) of the CoC Act is sufficiently broad to include civil as well as\ncriminal justice. The stage from which &quot;administration of justice&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_149\">commences may be prior to institution/initiation of judicial proceedings.\nSuch administration admits of infinite variety and can take myriad\nforms. By its very nature, &quot;administration of justice&quot; is also to be\nregarded as a continuing process since the threat to it does not end with\ntermination of proceedings. An order made to protect an identifiable\ninterest   may   require   continuance    of   protection   even    when      the\nproceedings are no longer pending. If not so construed, &quot;justice&quot; may\nlose its meaning.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_368\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1010328\" id=\"span_329\">242.

Having said so, we are also of the opinion that since the CoC\nAct does not provide a guideline on what constitutes interference\nwith/obstructing &quot;administration of justice&quot;, it is not advisable to spell\nout any strait-jacket formula which can be applied universally to all\ncases without variation. Having regard to the peculiar fact situation of\nevery case coming before it, the Court may in its discretion apply the\ncommon law doctrine of justice, equity and good conscience without,\nhowever, losing sight that the jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/231480/\" id=\"a_440\">section 2(c)</a> is one of\ndiscretion calling for exercise of authority with due care and caution and\nsparingly, only in appropriate cases.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_369\">243.

When courts find a\n       rule to be defective or violative of the constitutional or statutory\n       provision, they tend to save the rule, wherever possible and\n       practical, by reading it down by a benevolent interpretation, rather\n       than declare it as unconstitutional or invalid. But such an\n       occasion did not arise in this case as there was no challenge to the\n       validity of Rule 5 and the parties were not at issue on the validity\n       of the said Rule.

The haphazard mushrooming of the cable television network\nas a result of availability of signals of foreign television networks via\nsatellite communication, necessitated the Parliament to promulgate &quot;the\nCable Television Networks (Regulation) Ordinance&quot; on September 29,\n1994 which was later on replaced as an Act of the Parliament being the\nCTVN Act. The preamble of the CTVN Act records that it is &quot;an Act to\nregulate the operation of cable television networks in the country and for\nmatters connected therewith or incidental thereto&quot;. The statement of\nobjects and reasons of the CTVN Act is required to be noted, which\nreads thus:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_155\">            &quot;STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS\n                  There has been haphazard mushrooming\n            of cable television networks all over the country\n            during the last few years as a result of the\n            availability of signals of foreign television\n            networks via satellites. This has been perceived\n            as a &quot;cultural invasion&quot; in many quarters since\n            the programmes available on these satellite\n            channels are predominantly western and totally\n            alien to our culture and way of life. Since there\n            is no regulation of these cable television\n            networks, lot of undesirable programmes and\n            advertisements are becoming available to the\n            viewers without any kind if censorship.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_156\">            2.    It is also felt that the subscribers of these\n            cable television networks, the programmers and\n            the cable operators themselves are not aware of\n            their rights, responsibilities and obligations in\n            respect of the quality of service, technical as well\n            as content-wise, use of material protected by\n            copyright, exhibition of uncertified films,\n            protection of subscribers from anti-national\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_353\">                                      190</span>\n                                                      Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\n           broadcasts from sources inimical to our national\n           interest,   responsiveness  to    the   genuine\n           grievances of the subscribers and perceived\n           willingness to operate within the broad\n           framework of the laws of the land.e.g. the\n           <a href=\"/doc/980182/\" id=\"a_486\">Cinematograph Act, 1952</a>, the <a href=\"/doc/1136195/\" id=\"a_487\">Copyright Act,\n           1957</a>, Indecent Representation of Women\n           (Prohibition)Act, 1986.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_157\">           3.

It will, thus,\n           enable the optimal exploitation of this\n           technology which has the potential of making\n           available to the subscribers a vast pool of\n           information and entertainment.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_158\">           4.

Considering the provisions of the CTVN Act and the CTVN\nRules, and the Programme Code as stipulated under rule 6 of the CTVN\nRules, it certainly imposes conditions on the television channels which\nare in the form of restrictions to be mandatorily adhered to by the TV\nchannels. As noted above, rule 6 starts with negative words. It is well\nsettled that when the legislature uses negative words, such words make\nthe statute imperative. They are required to be construed as mandatory,\nmeaning thereby that the channels shall undertake actions in a manner\nas ordained by section 5 of the CTVN Act read with rule 6 of the CTVN\nRules. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"781949\" id=\"span_365\">In <a href=\"/doc/781949/\" id=\"a_524\">Nasiruddin &amp; Ors. vs. Sita Ram Agarwal</a>, reported in AIR\n2003 SC 1543, the Court held that it is well settled that when negative\nwords are used, the Court would presume that intention of the\nlegislature was that the provisions are mandatory in character.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_430\">275.        In the context of the issue before us, as rightly urged on\nbehalf of the petitioners at the Bar sub-rules (a), (d), (f), (g), (I) and (k)\nwould apply to the telecast which are in the nature of a media trial\nhaving adverse consequences on an ongoing criminal investigation.\nThese sub-rules would have omnibus application and would apply to\nsituations of a media trial at all the stages including when the process of\ncriminal law is set into motion on registration of an FIR resulting into\narrest and till the trial is complete and to further judicial proceedings\nbefore the Court.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_431\">276.        Having held that the provisions of section 5 of the CTVN Act\nproviding for the Programme Code read with rule 6 of the CTVN Rules\nbeing of mandatory application, it would be necessary to examine as to\nhow these provisions can be implemented. The provisions which are\ndirectly relevant and contemplate action to be taken on contravention of\nthe provisions of <a href=\"/doc/419856/\" id=\"a_525\">section 5</a> is section 11 of the CTVN Act, empowering\nthe authorised officer to seize equipment being used by the cable\noperator for operating the cable television network. The proviso to this\nsection postulates that the seizure of equipment in case of contravention\nof <a href=\"/doc/419856/\" id=\"a_526\">sections 5</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1915023/\" id=\"a_527\">6</a> shall be limited to the programming service provided\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_366\">                                      202</span>\n                                                    Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\non the channel generated at the level of the cable operator. Section 12 of\nthe CTVN Act provides for confiscation of the equipment seized under\nsub-section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/974692/\" id=\"a_528\">section 11</a>. Further, <a href=\"/doc/1478730/\" id=\"a_529\">section 13</a> provides that the\nseizure or confiscation of equipment could not interfere with other\npunishment to which the person affected thereby is liable under the\nprovisions of the CTVN Act. <a href=\"/doc/1923500/\" id=\"a_530\">Section 15</a> provides for an appeal against\nthe order of confiscation of equipment being passed.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_432\">277.        <a href=\"/doc/1677916/\" id=\"a_531\">Section 16</a> provides for punishment for contravention of\nprovisions of the CTVN Act and is a substantive provision. Thus a\npunishment is attracted when a person contravenes the provisions of\nthe CTVN Act. The punishment for the first offence is imprisonment for a\nterm which may extend to two years or with fine which may extend to\none thousand rupees or with both, and for every subsequent offence,\nwith imprisonment for a term which may extend to five years and with\nfine which may extend to five thousand rupees. Sub-section (2) states\nthat   notwithstanding    anything    contained   in   the    <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_532\">Cr.P.C</a>.,     the\ncontravention of section 4A (transmission of programmes through digital\naddressable systems) is a cognizable offence under this section. <a href=\"/doc/382459/\" id=\"a_533\">Section\n17</a> provides for offences by companies. <a href=\"/doc/1761055/\" id=\"a_534\">Section 18</a> provides that no\nCourt shall take cognizance of any offence punishable under the CTVN\nAct except otherwise on a complaint made in writing by any authorised\nofficer. <a href=\"/doc/1686702/\" id=\"a_535\">Section 19</a>, falling under Chapter V, is another substantive\npower to prohibit transmission of certain programmes in public interest,\nwhen the programme is not in conformity with the provisions prescribed\nin the Programme Code referred to in <a href=\"/doc/419856/\" id=\"a_536\">section 5</a> and Advertisement Code\nreferred to in <a href=\"/doc/1915023/\" id=\"a_537\">section 6</a>. Any programme or channel failing to conform to\nthe Programme Code and which is likely to disturb public tranquility, is\nsufficient to attract <a href=\"/doc/1686702/\" id=\"a_538\">section 19</a> and for the Authorised Officer to prohibit\ntransmission of certain programme in public interest. <a href=\"/doc/1436/\" id=\"a_539\">Section 20</a> is\nanother power to prohibit operation of cable television network in public\ninterest. This power is conferred on the Central Government to exercise\nin public interest to prohibit operation of any cable television network in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_367\">                                       203</span>\n                                                          Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\nsuch areas for the reasons as set out in sub-section (2), namely when\nthe Central Government thinks it necessary or expedient so to do in the\ninterest of the sovereignty or integrity of India; or security of India; or\nfriendly relations of India with foreign State; or public order, decency or\nmorality, being relevant factors in the context in hand. Sub-section (3)\ncategorically provides that where the Central Government considers that\nany programme of any channel is not in conformity with the prescribed\nProgramme     Code   referred   to    in    <a href=\"/doc/419856/\" id=\"a_540\">section   5</a>    or    the    prescribed\nAdvertisement Code referred to in <a href=\"/doc/1915023/\" id=\"a_541\">section 6</a>, it may by order, regulate or\nprohibit the transmission or re-transmission of such programme.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_433\">278.        It can, therefore, be seen that the CTVN Act is the repository\nof power to take measures for violation of the Programme Code which,\ninter alia, in clear and unambiguous terms prohibits carrying of any\nprogramme on the cable network amounting to contempt of court.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_434\">279.           For the reasons so discussed, we answer the question by\nrecording our firm opinion that the matters which are pending\ninvestigation on a criminal complaint clearly fall within the restriction as\ncontained in the Programme Code as stipulated under section 5 of the\nCTVN Act and Rule 6 of the CTVN Rules.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_435\">Question No.4\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_436\">280.        It is seen that the regime of self regulation has been brought\nabout by the medial channels by forming the NBA and the NBF.\nAdmittedly, these are private bodies formed by the news channels\nthemselves. It is submitted that 26 broadcasters representing 77 media\nchannels are members of the NBA and about sixty channels are\nmembers of the NBF. It is also not in dispute that there are large\nnumber of channels, stated to be about 1500, which operate in the\ncountry. All channels are not the members of the NBA/the NBF and\nhence, are not bound by any rules and regulations or Code of Conduct\nprescribed by these private bodies.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_368\">                                     204</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_437\">                                                    Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_438\">281.         As noted above, the members of the NBA would seem to be\nbound by the NBSA, which is headed by a retired Judge of the Supreme\nCourt being the Chairperson. The NBSA considers a complaint against\nthe members and associate members of any violation of Code of Ethics &amp;\nBroadcasting Standards as formulated by it and binding on its\nmembers. The member channel, if is found to have violated the Code of\nEthics, is imposed with a penalty of a nature to publish apology being\nscrolled during the course of its telecast, as also there is power to\nimpose maximum fine of Rs.1 lakh. As per the NBA, these are sufficient\npenalties which would keep its members within the four corners of the\nCode of Ethics and Regulations and practising standards. As far as the\nNBF is concerned, a body - NBFPNBSO is said to be constituted and the\nappointment of its Chairman is in process. So far there are no instances\nto show that the complaint mechanism has been activated by the NBF\nand any actions taken. Similar to the NBA, the NBFPNBSO proposes to\nimpose penalties in the nature of apology to be scrolled by an erring TV\nchannel and also a substantive fine of Rs.5 lakh and 10 lakh in case of a\nsecond and a third violation, respectively.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_439\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"169453366\" id=\"span_369\">282.         The case of these self-regulatory bodies is to the effect that\nthey provide sufficient check on their members so that they adhere to\nthe norms.    This, according to them, balances the larger interests as\nalso protect the right of free speech and expression and preserve\nindependence of the media. By referring to the decision in <a href=\"/doc/169453366/\" id=\"a_542\">Destruction\nof Public and Private Properties</a> (supra), it is urged that the Supreme\nCourt has approved the recommendations of the Nariman Committee\nwhich recommended an approach of self-regulation. It is their case that\nin the process, the Court also approved the model of media self-\nregulation and rejected State intervention. To examine this contention,\nparagraphs 32 and 33 of <a href=\"/doc/169453366/\" id=\"a_543\">the said decision</a> of the Supreme Court are\nrequired to be noted which read thus:-</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_199\">             &quot;32.

There are\ndiffering views as to whether the media\n(particularly the electronic media) has exercised\nits right and privilege responsibly. But\ngeneralisations    should    be   avoided.

The Supreme Court in the above case had taken a serious\nnote of various instances of large scale destruction of public and private\nproperties in the name of agitations, bandhs, hartals and the like.

A   perusal   of   the   recommendations   of   the    Nariman\nCommittee, as reflected in paragraph 32 of the said decision, would go\nto show that the Committee was of the opinion that given the exigencies\nof competition, there is a degree of sensationalism, which in itself was\nnot harmful so long as it preserved the essential role of the media\nnamely to report news as it occurs - and eschew comment or criticism. It\nwas observed that there are differing views as to whether the media and\nmore particularly the electronic media exercises its right and privilege\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_373\">                                     208</span>\n                                                       Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\nresponsibly and that the electronic media should act responsibly. In\nparagraph (viii), the Committee endorsed the need for formation of\nprinciples of responsible broadcasting, and institutional arrangements of\nself regulation. It is in this context the Committee approved the NBA\nmodel as a process that can be built upon both as the broadcasting\nservice provider level as well as at the industry level and recommend\nthat the same be incorporated as guidelines issued by this Court under\n<a href=\"/doc/500307/\" id=\"a_548\">Article 142</a> of the Constitution of India. The Supreme Court observed\nthat these suggestions were extremely important and they constitute\nsufficient guidelines which need to be adopted, however, leaving it to the\nappropriate authorities to take effective steps for their implementation.\nThe Supreme Court did not give any positive directions in that regard.\nIn view of these clear observations, we do not agree with the NBA or the\nNBF that a self regulatory mechanism can be held to be conclusive. We\nalso hold that such self-regulatory mechanism would not take the\ncharacter of a statutory mechanism. It needs to be stated that despite\nclear directions of the Supreme Court, we are not shown any directives\nissued by the Central Government accepting the self-regulatory\nmechanism     to   be   a   conclusive    mechanism.     The    self-regulatory\nmechanism does not have any statutory recognition, in the absence of\nwhich, it is not possible for us to hold that the self-regulatory\nmechanism would have any sanctity in law. These are the bodies formed\nby private channels. There is no control whatsoever on the functioning\nof these bodies by the Central Government or any other statutory\nagencies. The regime of penalties prescribed also, in our opinion, is not a\ndeterrent of such measure which in a given case could be said to be in\nthe proportion of the damage, an objectional broadcast may cause, by\nmedia excesses or irresponsible reporting of the nature complained of by\nthe petitioners. In any event, considering the observations of the\nSupreme Court in paragraph 33, the NBA and the NBSA cannot argue\nthat the Court conferred any legal sanctity on their self-regulatory\nmechanism.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_374\">                                       209</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_456\">                                                       Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_457\">286.         In this context there is yet another significant facet is\nrequired to be noted, namely that such self-regulatory mechanism is\napplicable only to the members of the NBA or the NBF and not to those\nTV channels who have not subscribed to the membership of these self\nregulatory bodies. Further the TV channels, which may have reasons to\nrepudiate the membership of such self regulatory bodies for some\nunpalatable reasons, can easily evade and escape the regulatory\nmeasures being imposed on it. There is no mechanism to remedy such\nsituation. Such option being available to a member is as good as a farce\nand/or a mockery of the self-regulatory mechanism. It was strenuously\ncontended that one TV channel went out of the NBA and formed another\nself-regulatory   mechanism.     In   our   opinion,   such     self-regulatory\nmechanism would hardly meet the constitutional expectations of the\ncitizens of a fair and responsible broadcasting, which would not be of a\nnature of an unwarranted sensitization, excessive publicity, leakage of\nevidence, and vilifying coverage, affecting public confidence in the\njudicial system and in the administration of criminal justice. The\nGovernment being the owner of air-waves, which the electronic media\nuses, it would not amount to any breach of the freedom the media\nenjoys under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_549\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution if such erring channels\nare hauled up and/or paralyzed by the relevant authority for violation of\nthe Programme Code.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_458\">287.         We, accordingly, answer question no.(iv) observing that\nalthough the objects of the NBA and the NBF could be laudable, the\ncourse and the regime of self- regulation as adopted by its bodies cannot\nhave any sanctity within the statutory framework.          It is, accordingly,\nanswered in the negative.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_459\">QUESTION NO.5\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_460\">288.         The discussion leading to the answer to this question must\nbegin with what a &#x27;fair trial&#x27; is and what is a &#x27;trial by media&#x27;.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_375\">                                      210</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_461\">                                                      Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_462\">289.         The criminal justice system in India has, at its heart, the\nright of an accused to a fair trial. A &#x27;fair trial&#x27; takes within its embrace\nvarious rights that are well acknowledged, viz. the fundamental of the\ncriminal justice system that an accused is presumed to be innocent\nunless proved guilty, and the rights of an accused: to maintain silence,\nto have an open trial, to have the facility of legal representation, to\nspeedy trial, to hear witnesses and to cross-examine them. Apart from\nbenefiting the accused in his right of defence, what is of paramount\nimportance is that these rights are in-built in the system to enhance the\nconfidence of the public insofar as efficiency and integrity of the justice\ndelivery system is concerned.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_463\">290.         While the right of a fair trial has to be zealously guarded,\nequally important is the right of the press/media to keep the public\ninformed of matters of public interest. These could include reporting of\ncourt proceedings involving people belonging to the top echelons of\nsociety, legislators, judges, bureaucrats, celebrities, etc.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_464\">291.         What would be the position if these two rights are in\nconflict? One would find an interesting observation in Solicitor General\nv. Wellington Newspapers Ltd., reported in (1995) 1 NZLR 45, to the\nfollowing effect:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_207\">       &quot;In the event of conflict between the concept of freedom of speech\n       and the requirements of a fair trial, all other things being equal,\n       the latter should prevail ... In pre-trial publicity situations, the\n       loss of freedom involved is not absolute. It is merely a delay. The\n       loss is an immediacy; that is precious to any journalist, but is as\n       nothing compared to the need for fair trial...&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_465\">292.         There are precedents in the matter of trial by media and the\neffect it may have on pending trials. The same are instructive and would\nprovide suitable guidance to us to decide the question issue arising for\ndecision.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_466\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"58440\" id=\"span_376\">293.         <a href=\"/doc/58440/\" id=\"a_550\">R.K.

Facts of two cases are seldom alike. However, one decision\nof the Supreme Court which could be of some assistance to us in view of\nthe facts thereof bearing close resemblance to the stage of proceedings\n(read: police investigation into a crime was/is in progress) is the one in\n<a href=\"/doc/1511447/\" id=\"a_557\">M.P. Lohia</a> (supra). The Supreme Court was dealing with an application\nfor anticipatory bail of an applicant husband, accused of abetting the\nsuicide of his wife. The applicant&#x27;s claim was that his wife committed\nsuicide due to depression. At the stage of investigation, the case received\nwide publicity. An article was published in a magazine, based on the\nversion of the deceased, as regards complicity of the applicant and his\nfamily members. The Court deprecated such irresponsible publication\nduring pending investigation and ruled as follows:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_216\">             &quot;10. Having gone through the records, we find one\n             disturbing factor which we feel is necessary to comment\n             upon in the interest of justice. The death of Chandni took\n             place on 28-10-2003 and the complaint in this regard was\n             registered and the investigation was in progress. The\n             application for grant of anticipatory bail was disposed of by\n             the High Court of Calcutta on 13-2-2004 and special leave\n             petition was pending before this Court. Even then an article\n             has appeared in a magazine called &#x27;Saga&#x27; titled &#x27;Doomed by\n             Dowry&#x27; written by one Kakoli Poddar based on her interview\n             of the family of the deceased, giving version of the tragedy\n             and extensively quoting the father of the deceased as to his\n             version of the case. The facts narrated therein are all\n             materials that may be used in the forthcoming trial in this\n             case and we have no hesitation that these type of articles\n             appearing in the media would certainly interfere with the\n             administration of justice. We deprecate this practice and\n             caution the publisher, editor and the journalist who were\n             responsible for the said article against indulging in such\n             trial by media when the issue is sub judice.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_482\">                                         (underlining for emphasis by us)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_483\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"62107217\" id=\"span_387\">298.

Such crude attempts to claim credit for\n            imaginary investigational breakthroughs should be curbed.\n            Even where a suspect surrenders or a person required for\n            questioning voluntarily appears, it is not uncommon for the\n            investigating officers to represent to the media that the\n            person was arrested with much effort after considerable\n            investigation or a chase. Similarly, when someone\n            voluntarily declares the money he is carrying, media is\n            informed that huge cash which was not declared was\n            discovered by their vigilant investigations and thorough\n            checking. Premature disclosures or &#x27;leakage&#x27; to the media in\n            a pending investigation will not only jeopardise and impede\n            further investigation, but many a time, allow the real culprit\n            to escape from law.

The legal position clearly emerging on a bare reading of the\nscheme of the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_575\">Cr.P.C</a>. relatable to investigation under Chapter XII\nthereof as well perusal of the dicta of the Supreme Court noted above is\nthat a fair trial ought to be preceded by an investigation that is fair to\nthe accused as well as the victim. To ensure that an investigation is fair\nis not the duty of the courts alone, it is as much an obligation of the\ninvestigator and his superiors to have an investigation into a crime\nconducted in such manner that it serves the purpose for which it is\nintended. Although investigation is an arena reserved for the police and\nthe executive and the courts would be loath to interfere with\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_399\">                                       219</span>\n                                                       Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\ninvestigation, it does not detract from the character of activity\nundertaken by an investigator that a free, fair, impartial, effective and\nmeaningful investigation of a cognizable offence is a necessary\nconcomitant of &quot;administration of justice&quot;, undoubtedly covering a wider\narea than &quot;adjudication of cases and dispensation of justice&quot;, which\ntruly belongs to the judiciary, and any speech/publication in exercise of\na citizen&#x27;s freedom of speech while conforming to restrictions imposed by\nlaw in general under clause (2) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_576\">Article 19</a> must also yield to larger\nconsiderations of maintaining the purity of administration of justice. The\nPunjab High Court in <a href=\"/doc/1546234/\" id=\"a_577\">Rao Harnarain v. Gumori Ram</a>, reported in AIR\n1958 Pun 273, rightly pointed out:</span>\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_221\">         &quot;Liberty of the press is subordinate to the administration of\n         justice. The plain duty of a journalist is the reporting and not the\n         adjudication of cases.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_500\">310.           In course of hearing, we had illustrated as to how\nunregulated media reporting could adversely affect investigations that\nare in progress and requested learned counsel appearing for the\nrespondents to respond. Quite naturally, we were greeted with meek\nresponses. All the learned counsel opposing the writ petitions could not\nhave disputed and did not in fact dispute the consequences that could\nensue upon constant media coverage in respect of an on-going\ninvestigation.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_501\">311.           What was illustrated, in concise form, is as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_222\">   (i)     Impact, qua the accused, is that, he could be put on guard. If\n            an accused is not being trailed by the police, it does not mean\n            that the investigator is turning a blind eye towards him. The\n            essence of a police investigation is skillful inquiry and\n            collection of material and evidence in a manner by which the\n            potential culpable individuals are not forewarned. Because of\n            unnecessary meddling by the media, the accused can destroy\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_400\">                                    220</span>\n                                                    Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\n        evidence and avoid arrest by absconding, making the task of\n        the investigator difficult in searching for the truth.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_223\">(ii)    Impact, qua an innocent person, if he were projected as an\n        accused along with the principal accused and hounded by the\n        investigator based on media reporting, is that he stands the\n        risk of his reputation, built up on years of sincere efforts and\n        good work, being damaged beyond imagination and may, in\n        rare cases, lead to suicide or attempts in relation thereto. It\n        does not take much time for the viewers of the media report to\n        forget the past good deeds of such person and to accept as\n        gospel truth what has been reported by the media, but insofar\n        as the targeted individual is concerned, the loss, injury and\n        prejudice could be irreparable. This would be against a just\n        social order.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_224\">(iii)   Impact, qua a vital witness, is that he could be won over,\n        threatened or even physically harmed to ensure that he does\n        not tender evidence. Nothing can be more damaging in the\n        pursuit of truth if a vital witness does not turn up for tendering\n        evidence or even if he turns up, is declared hostile by the\n        prosecution for reasons too obvious. The prosecution theory\n        would fall into pieces, unless of course there is other credible\n        evidence to nail the accused.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_225\">(iv)    Impact, qua the investigator, could be equally pernicious and\n        cause miscarriage of justice. On account of human failing, the\n        investigator could be influenced by the media reports; although\n        he may be following a particular track, which in fact is the\n        right track, he could abandon the right track and follow a\n        different track leading him to nowhere. On the contrary, if the\n        investigator instead of changing tracks as suggested by the\n        media follows the track chosen by him, he could be maligned\n        by the media and accused of improper investigation creating an\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_401\">                                       221</span>\n                                                     Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\n         adverse opinion in the minds of the viewers which, in any\n         circumstance, is undesirable and unwarranted.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_226\">   (v)   Impact, qua the investigation, is that publicity in respect of\n         certain aspects of a case by media reporting that the\n         investigator is indulging in secrecy can hamper the course of\n         due investigation. Although trials in court are open proceedings\n         to which each member of the public can have access unless\n         proceedings are held in-camera, there is no law requiring the\n         investigator to conduct investigation openly and to lay before\n         the public, at different stages of investigation, evidence that he\n         has collected in course thereof.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_502\">Thus noticed, without much debate, an area can be carved out for\ncorrective action.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_503\">312.        Given the circumstance that the press/media has the ability\nto mould the opinion of the society by publicity of certain facets of an\ninvestigative process, which could give rise to strong public emotions\nand prejudice the case of one party or the other, it ought to refrain from\ntaking stances in its presentations which are biased and show a\npredilection for a particular point of view having enormous potential of\ndeflecting the course of justice.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_504\">313.        Learned counsel for Republic TV contended with vehemence\nthat &quot;investigative journalism&quot; has brought to light matters of grave\nconcern and interest to the society at large. As a sequel to such activity\nundertaken by its reporters, Republic TV gathered incriminating\nmaterials that could connect the accused with the offence of murder and\nhas honestly endeavoured to place facts for the information of its\nviewers, which Mumbai Police had been suppressing.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_505\">314.        To   our   mind,    the    contention   proceeds   on    a    clear\nmisunderstanding of the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_578\">Cr.P.C</a>. If indeed the channel\nis in possession of information that could assist the investigator, it\nought not to be part of a news coverage but it would be the duty of such\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_402\">                                      222</span>\n                                                      Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\nchannel to provide the information that it has to the police under\n<a href=\"/doc/923007/\" id=\"a_579\">sections 37</a> to <a href=\"/doc/1445515/\" id=\"a_580\">39</a> of the Cr.P.C. to facilitate a proper investigation.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_506\">315.        That apart, the campaign against Mumbai Police of having\nsuppressed facts appears to be ill-founded in view of the order of the\nSupreme Court dated August 19, 2020. It recorded a prima facie\nsatisfaction of the Court, on perusal of the records, that the same do not\nsuggest any wrong doing by Mumbai Police although obstruction to the\nBihar Police team could have been avoided so as not to give rise to any\nsuspicion on the bonafide of the enquiry.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_507\">316.        Giving due recognition to the press/media as the fourth\npillar of democracy and that it plays a vital role in not only\ndisseminating information to the public but at times in urging the\njustice delivery system to set right a wrong, there have been several\ndecisions of the Supreme Court expressing hope and trust that the\nmedia would cover and report events and incidents accurately and by\nexercising a degree of restraint so as not to impinge on others&#x27; rights\nand even if it does cross the line, the self-regulatory mechanism would\nspring in to keep the media under check. The sole intention was to\nensure that nothing would be done which could be destructive of orderly\nadministration of justice, challenge the supremacy of the rule of law and\nshake the confidence of the people in the judicial process. Drawing from\nexperience, there is good enough reason to conclude that the hope and\ntrust are belied and the self-regulatory mechanism has failed to deliver\nin adequate measure in keeping erring media houses under check. It is\nnow time that some corrective action is taken, lest judicial independence\nremains only on paper and right-thinking people start losing faith in the\njustice delivery system and doubt the capacity of the Courts to correct\nwhat needs to be corrected.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_508\">317.        The position in law qua the right of the Press in the light of\nthe guarantee of freedom of speech and expression enumerated in\n<a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_581\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution conditioned with the rider that no\nFundamental Right is absolute and is subject to reasonable restrictions\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_403\">                                     223</span>\n                                                    Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\nbeing imposed by law is so well settled by the Supreme Court, on\nnumerous occasions, that nothing more is required to be expressed\nexcept that <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_582\">Article 21</a>, despite having the fewest count of words among\nall the Fundamental Rights, is the most fundamental of all Fundamental\nRights that the Constitution of India guarantees to all persons, and the\nrights guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_583\">Article 19</a> to the citizens have to settle for a\nbackseat in case of an apparent conflict between the two. The procedure\nfor depriving a person of his right to life has to be eminently just, fair\nand reasonable but deprivation sought to be effected by &#x27;media trial&#x27; or\n&#x27;parallel investigation&#x27; by the media is not a procedure that has any legal\nsanctity. In such a situation, the Court has to step in to protect those\nthe rights of whom are found to be in jeopardy by reason of apathy\nand/or indifference of the State to check programmes of media houses\nwhich tend to offend <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_584\">Article 21</a> rights.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_509\">318.        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"505842\" id=\"span_404\">In <a href=\"/doc/505842/\" id=\"a_585\">Union of India vs. Raghubir Singh</a>, reported in AIR 1989\nSC 1933, a Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court had the occasion\nto observe that today, it is no longer in doubt that a substantial volume\nof the law governing the lives of citizens and regulating the functions of\nthe State flows from decisions of the superior courts. It is not expected\nthat a high court, despite observing violation of rights, would remain a\nmute spectator by adopting a passive or negative role.

The PCI, which has issued the aforesaid Press Release, is a\ncreature of the PCI Act. It is a statutory authority which functions as a\nwatch guard of the Press, for the Press and by the Press. It has\nadjudicatory power in the sense that it adjudicates the complaints\nagainst and by the Press for violation of ethics and for violation of\n&#x27;Freedom of the Press&#x27;, respectively. The power to punish, in exercise of\npowers conferred by the PCI Act, includes imposition of punishment\nsuch as, warning, admonition and censuring the newspapers, news\nagencies, the editors or journalists or to disapprove the conduct of the\npersons associated with the Press. The guidelines contained in the Press\nRelease dated September 13, 2019 is prompted by the object of the PCI\nto maintain the standard of reporting by the newspapers and news\nagencies in India. One of the functions that the PCI is obliged to perform\nis to build up a Code of Conduct for the newspapers, news agencies and\njournalists in accordance with high professional standards as well as to\nensure on the part of the newspapers, news agencies and journalists,\nthe maintenance of high standard of public taste and foster a new sense\nof the rights and responsibilities of citizenship. Bearing in mind such\nfunctions that the PCI is obligated to discharge in terms of the PCI Act,\nsection 13 of the PCI Act appears to be the repository of power to frame\nguidelines. The guidelines issued by the PCI, though binding on the\nprint media, do not bind the electronic media.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_517\">323.

It is, therefore, clear from the above that the need to guide\nand give advice to the media to report on cases of suicide has been given\nmuch importance, although a breach of such advice/guidelines may not\ninstill a sense of fear of being penalized having regard to the soft stances\nthat are taken either by the statutory authorities or by the self-\nregulatory mechanism of the broadcasters&#x27; associations.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_242\">325.        However, keeping in view the holistic purpose that is sought\nto be achieved by implementation of the guidelines contained in the\nPress Release dated September 13, 2019, we see no reason as to why\napart from the print media, the electronic media may not be guided\nthereby while reporting on death cases by suicide. We hold that in the\nabsence of guidelines of a statutory authority formulating similar such\nstandards and putting in place in relation to reporting of deaths by\nsuicide for the electronic media, the norms of journalistic conduct\nframed by the PCI for the print media ought to be extended to cover the\nelectronic media till such time appropriate guidelines are framed for the\nelectronic media by the appropriate authority. Though the electronic\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_409\">                                    228</span>\n                                                   Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\nmedia is not bound by the PCI Act, we are prompted to hold that the\nelectronic media should also be guided by the contents of the guidelines\nof the PCI on reporting of death cases by suicide for two reasons: first,\nthe said guidelines have a statutory flavour and similar such binding\nguidelines on reporting cases of death by suicide are non-existent for the\nelectronic media; and secondly, the absence of such guidelines could,\nand as we have been shown in the present case, lead to the dignity of\nthe dead being breached with impunity. The death of the actor was\nfollowed by such crude, indecent and distasteful news reporting by a few\nof the TV channels that we do not consider it worthy of being referred to\nhere and be a part of this judgment. Nonetheless, instead of the Court\nlegislating and laying down guidelines on reporting of death cases by\nsuicide, it would be wise and prudent on our part to give direction for\nadherence to the guidelines of the PCI in this behalf by the electronic\nmedia while it reports cases of death by suicide, which would secure the\nends of justice.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_243\">326.        Since none can possibly dispute that the dead should also\nbe treated with dignity, particularly those who die by suicide for varying\nreasons which are personal to the deceased, we wish to observe and\nhold that the guidelines issued by the PCI are comprehensive and\nreasonable enough commending itself to be followed in letter and spirit\nby the print media as well as the electronic media appropriate guidelines\nare framed, observed above. We hope and trust that the PCI guidelines\non reporting of death cases by suicide would be adhered to with the\nattention and care the relevant situation deserves and any breach of\nsuch guidelines in future might, in appropriate cases, expose the erring\nmedia house to be dealt with appropriately in accordance with law. It is\nordered accordingly.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_244\">327.        In addition to the above, we also hope and trust that the\nnews channels which are members of the NBA shall follow the advisory\ndated August 13, 2020 and breach, if any, in future, may also be\nappropriately dealt with by the NBSA.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_410\">                                      229</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_245\">                                                     Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_246\">328.         Having regard to the above, we see no reason to give any\nadditional guideline for compliance.       Question no. A, thus, stands\nanswered.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_247\">Question B:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_248\">329.         The exhibits to the writ petitions, mainly clippings and\nscreen shots, bear ample testimony to two TV channels&#x27; reportage upon\nthe death of the actor and the materials that they claimed to have\ngathered, supposedly through &quot;investigative journalism&quot;, before and\nafter the CBI took up investigation in terms of the order of the Supreme\nCourt. Republic TV while propagating the theory that the actor was\n&quot;killed&quot; and expressing apprehension as to whether the probe by\nMumbai Police could be trusted in view of serious lapses that it had\ncommitted, also sought for public opinion as to whether the actress\nshould be arrested. In course of one such scathing attack against\nMumbai Police, the channel by referring to an autopsy report of the ex-\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_530\">manager of the actor (who too died in mysterious circumstances)\nhighlighted that her body was found unclothed. Apart from anything\nelse, a clear lack of courtesy to a woman who has left this world is\ndemonstrated thereby. On its part, Times Now displayed close-up\npictures of the cadaver of the actor, one alleged to have been given by\nthe actor&#x27;s family, and raised suspicion in respect of a ligature mark by\nremarking that another image was morphed. While expressing views\nthat Mumbai Police had not done its job properly necessitating the\nmedia to pursue the case of securing justice to the actor, the channel\nwent to the extent of commenting that the activists&#x27; plea to restrain the\nmedia was a move to suppress coverage on the death of the actor.\nSerious concerns were raised by both the TV channels as to why an FIR\nwas not registered or as to why no arrest was effected. Speakers invited\nby such channels ranging from ministers, members of the Parliament,\nlawyers,    political   analysts,   forensic   experts,   social     activists,\nspokespersons of political parties, etc., expressed views appearing on\nscreen as to how Mumbai Police had bungled the inquiry/investigation\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_411\">                                     230</span>\n                                                     Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\ninto the unnatural death of the actor by failing to follow standard\noperating procedure, ignoring key evidence, hiding relevant forensic\ndetails, letting off conspirators and shielding the culprits. In fine, these\nTV channels continued their endeavor of informing the masses that\nMumbai Police was suppressing the truth with a view to cover-up the\nentire incident. In the process, in an attempt to out-smart each other\n(for reasons which we need not discuss here), these two TV channels\nstarted a vicious campaign of masquerading as the crusaders of truth\nand justice and the saviours of the situation thereby exposing, what in\ntheir perception, Mumbai Police had suppressed, caring less for the\nrights of other stakeholders and throwing the commands of the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_588\">Cr.P.C</a>.\nand all sense of propriety to the winds. It amuses us not a little that\nRepublic TV doffed its own hat, in appreciation of what its team had\nachieved, without realizing that it could be irking and invite adverse\ncomments.     While   inquiry/investigation    by   Mumbai       Police    was\nstrenuously asserted by these TV channels to be shoddy and\nquestionable, the Supreme Court in its order dated August 19, 2020\nrecorded prima facie satisfaction of Mumbai Police not having indulged\nin any wrong doing. Despite such order, reports/ discussions/\ndebates/interviews on the death of the actor flowed thick and fast from\nthese TV channels in brazen disregard of the rule of law, the edifice on\nwhich the country&#x27;s Constitution rests. These TV channels took upon\nthemselves the role of the investigator, the prosecutor as well as the\nJudge and delivered the verdict as if, during the pandemic, except they\nall organs of the State were in slumber. While we need not repeat here\nwhat Mumbai Police was accused of by these TV channels, judicial\nnotice may be taken that the actress, although entitled to her rights to\nlife and equal protection of the laws, protected by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_589\">Articles 21</a> and <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_590\">14</a> of\nthe Constitution, and the right guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_591\">Article 20(3)</a> thereof to\nmaintain silence, was painted as the villain of the piece, had the rug\nbelow the presumption of innocence removed, and received the media&#x27;s\nverdict that she is guilty of orchestrating the actor&#x27;s murder, much\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_412\">                                     231</span>\n                                                    Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\nbefore filing of a police report under <a href=\"/doc/461024/\" id=\"a_592\">section 173(2)</a>, Cr.P.C.; and that in\nthe situation as depicted, omission or neglect to arrest the actress\namounted to a glaring act of impropriety by Mumbai Police. We have no\nhesitation to record that this sort of reporting by the media is immensely\nprejudicial to the interests of the accused and could dent the process of\na future fair trial and derail due administration of criminal justice, once\nthe matter reaches the appropriate court having jurisdiction. We also\naccept Mr.Chinoy&#x27;s contention that such reporting could be seen as\nviolation of the Programme Code. Even if the contents of the\nreports/discussions/debates are considered to be mere insinuations\nand aspersions against Mumbai Police and the actress, they lack bona\nfides, are aimed at interfering with and/or obstructing administration of\njustice and have the propensity to shake the public confidence in the\ncapability of the police machinery and the efficacy of the judiciary. In\nour    considered    opinion,    telecast    of   reports/      discussions\n/debates/interviews by these TV channels on the death of the actor and\nevents subsequent thereto, brought on record by the petitioners is,\nprima facie, contemptuous having ingredients of criminal contempt of\nthe nature specified in section 2(c)(iii) of the CoC Act and could attract\npenalty under <a href=\"/doc/269047/\" id=\"a_593\">section 12</a> thereof.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_531\">330.        However, having regard to the subject matter of these\nproceedings and the questions that we have been tasked to decide, we\ndo not consider it appropriate to initiate action for criminal contempt\nagainst these TV channels. Of course, while refraining from so doing, we\nhope and trust that they shall act more responsibly in future and not\ncreate a situation for the Court to take recourse to the provisions of\n<a href=\"/doc/207538/\" id=\"a_594\">Article 215</a> of the Constitution and the CoC Act to invoke its jurisdiction\nto punish for contempt.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_532\">331.          Insofar as the other part of Question B is concerned, we\ncould have left it unanswered having regard to the limited relief claimed\nby Mr.Chinoy on behalf of the petitioners (Mahesh Narayan Singh and\nthe others). Nonetheless, we need to express our views on such part\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_413\">                                    232</span>\n                                                    Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\nquestion too lest confusion prevails. We place on record that in the light\nof the order of the Supreme Court dated August 19, 2020, Mumbai\nPolice cannot be accused of any wrong doing by the electronic media\nand, prima facie, the criticism made seems to be not fair. The petitioners\n(Mahesh Narayan Singh and the others) could be justified in their\nconcern that persistent criticism could bring down the morale of the\npolice force and prove counter-productive and, therefore, utmost care\nshould be taken to present reports that are tested and found to be true\nand correct. Any biased information or incorrect reporting may damage\nnot only the good and clean reputation of a police officer, built over the\nyears, but also the institution to which he belongs. We need to remind\nthat every journalist/reporter has an overriding duty to the society of\neducating the masses with fair, accurate, trustworthy and responsible\nreports relating to reportable events/incidents and above all to the\nstandards of his/her profession. Thus, the temptation to sensationalize\nshould be resisted. However, this is neither the stage to give Mumbai\nPolice a certificate that it has conducted the necessary inquiry following\nthe actor&#x27;s death in accordance with law nor to validate the adverse\nreporting by the electronic media. Any final opinion in this regard must\nawait the verdict of the criminal courts at the several stages, right up to\nthe remedy last available to an aggrieved party.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_533\">332.         The above discussion, we are inclined to believe, adequately\nanswers Question B.\n\nQuestion\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_534\">333.         From a cumulative reading of the statutory provisions\nengrafted in the CTVN Act and the CTVN Rules, it is clearly seen that a\nrobust statutory framework has been laid down thereunder read with\nthe Up-linking and Down-linking guidelines. However, considering the\nfacts on record, it is quite clear to us that the implementation of these\nprovisions is far from satisfactory. We say so primarily for two\nfundamental reasons. First, we have not been shown any material that\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_414\">                                    233</span>\n                                                    Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\neither the authorized officer or any other appropriate machinery, has\nverified telecast made by several news channels in relation to the\nunnatural death of the actor which allegedly amounts to a media trial.\nThe nature of surveillance required to scrutinize the contents being\nbroadcast to ascertain as to whether they are in violation of the\nProgramme Code, appears to have remained dormant and/or in deep\nslumber. No decisions were taken in regard to the complaints which\nwere received. The second reason being the strange perception of the\nUOI as depicted in its reply affidavit in regard to the actions which\nwould be taken by the Central Government in regard to the violation of\nthe Programme Code, when it is stated that such complaints of violation\nwere received and were referred to a private body, namely the NBA. The\nfollowing paragraphs in the counter affidavit of Shri. Prem Chand, Under\nSecretary in the MI&amp;B, Government of India, are required to be noted in\nthe context that the very authority under the CTVN Act did not take any\naction or, as contended by the petitioners, abdicated its powers to take\nsuch actions. Paragraphs 5 to 9 of the affidavit read thus:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_249\">            &quot;5.    That with regard to electronic media, it is\n            stated that as per existing regulatory framework,\n            programmes telecast on private satellite TV\n            channels are regulated in terms of the <a href=\"/doc/1776076/\" id=\"a_595\">Cable\n            Television Networks (Regulation) Act,1995</a> and\n            Cable Television Network Rules, 1994 framed\n            thereunder. All programmes telecast on such\n            GTV channels are required to adhere to the\n            Programme Codes prescribed under the Rules.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_250\">            6.     That as part of self-regulatory, News\n            Broadcasters Association (NBA), a representative\n            body of news and current affairs channels has\n            formulated Code of Ethics and Broadcasting\n            Standards covering a wide range of principles to\n            self-regulate news broadcasting and News\n            Broadcasting Standards Regulations. Code of\n            Ethics and Broadcasting Standards has made\n            provisions that channels should strive not to\n            broadcast anything defamatory or libelous and\n            must strive to ensure that allegations are not\n            portrayed as fact and changes are not conveyed\n            as an act of guilt.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_415\">                                   234</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_251\">                                                  Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_252\">           7.

Recently,\n           NBSA has issued advisory dated 13.08.2020\n           (Annexure -II) wherein attention of News\n           Channels is drawn to specific guidelines\n           covering reportage dated 10.02.2020 which\n           deals with the manner in which media should\n           report on case of suicide.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_253\">           8.     That     some     complaints      including\n           petitioner&#x27;s complaint dated 20.06.2020 have\n           been received in the Ministry against the\n           telecast of news report relating to unfortunate\n           demise of Actor Sushant Singh Rajput by\n           various TV news channels. Some of these TV\n           channels are members of the self-regulatory\n           body i.e. News Broadcasters Association (NBA),\n           these complaints were forwarded to NBA for\n           further necessary action in the matter on\n           10.08.2020. NBA has informed that the matter\n           is being enquired into.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_254\">           9.     That the Ministry of Information and\n           Broadcasting      also   has   an    institutional\n           mechanism to deal with violation of Programme\n           Codes towards this end, an inter-Ministerial\n           Committee (IMC) has been constituted under the\n           Chairmanship of Additional Secretary (I&amp;B) and\n           comprising officers drawn from Ministries of\n           Home Affairs, Defence, External Affairs, Law,\n           Women &amp; Child Development, Health &amp; Family\n           Welfare, Consumer Affairs, Information and\n           Broadcasting and a representative from the\n           Industry in Advertising Standards Council of\n           India      (ASCI)      which      may       review\n           decision/recommendation of NBA.

The\n           final decision regarding penalty and its quantum\n           is taken by the Ministry.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_535\">334.       Hence, there is much substance in the contentions as urged\non behalf of the petitioners. We do not approve such abdication of\nsubstantive power conferred by the CTVN Act and the CTVN Rules by\nsuch authorities in favour of a voluntary organization (private body),\nwhich is formed by the channels themselves, namely, the NBA and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_416\">                                        235</span>\n                                                       Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\nwhich has constituted the &#x27;NBSA&#x27;. In view of our conclusion that matters\nwhich are pending investigation on a criminal complaint clearly fall\nwithin   the     restriction   as   contained   in   the   Programme       Code,\ncontemplated under section 5 of the CTVN Act and rule 6 of the CTVN\nRules, it would be a mandatory obligation of such authorities to\nimmediately act upon the complaints received against the TV channels\nwho are alleged to be violating the Programme Code or any other\nprovisions of the CTVN Act and the CTVN Rules and take necessary\naction as provided for thereunder. Such regime is also recognized by the\nUp-linking and Down-linking guidelines. A clear statutory regime so\nprescribed cannot be permitted to be rendered nugatory and/or totally\nineffective by an approach to refer the complaint to the self- regulatory\nauthority. Most significantly, the CTVN Act and the CTVN Rules do not\nrecognize such mechanism as adopted by the UOI and placed on record\nby Shri. Prem Chand, Under Secretary, MI&amp;B. It would be in the teeth\nof the provisions of the CTVN Act and the CTVN Rules and would\namount to total non-implementation of the powers as otherwise\nconferred by such statutory provisions. The substantive statutory\nprovisions, thus, cannot be rendered otiose by evolving a mechanism\nalien to the CTVN Act and the CTVN Rules. We, accordingly, direct that\nevery complaint which would be made on the contents of any\nprogramme on any television channel, either to the authorized officer or\nthe Central Government in regard to violation of the Programme Code,\nshall be dealt with in a manner as provided under the CTVN Act and\nimmediate action be taken thereon, without involvement of any private\nbodies like NBSA or NBF.

However, such\n            orders of postponement should be ordered for a limited\n            duration and without disturbing the content of the\n            publication. They should be passed only when necessary to\n            prevent real and substantial risk to the fairness of the trial\n            (court proceedings), if reasonable alternative methods or\n            measures such as change of venue or postponement of trial\n            will not prevent the said risk and when the salutary effects of\n            such orders outweigh the deleterious effects to the free\n            expression of those affected by the prior restraint. The order\n            of postponement will only be appropriate in cases where the\n            balancing test otherwise favours non-publication for a\n            limited period. It is not possible for this Court to enumerate\n            categories of publications amounting to contempt. It would\n            require the courts in each case to see the content and the\n            context of the offending publication. There cannot be any\n            straitjacket formula enumerating such categories. In our\n            view, keeping the above parameters, if the High\n            Court/Supreme Court (being courts of record) pass\n            postponement orders under their inherent jurisdictions,\n            such orders would fall within &#x27;reasonable restrictions&#x27; under\n            Article 19(2) and which would be in conformity with societal\n            interests, as held in Cricket Assn. of Bengal, (1995) 2 SCC\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_256\">            161. ...

Further, we must also keep in mind the words of <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_604\">Article\n            19(2)</a> &#x27;in relation to contempt of court&#x27;. At the outset, it may\n            be stated that like other freedoms, clause (1)(a) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_605\">Article 19</a>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_419\">                         237</span>\n                                        Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\nrefers to the common law right of freedom of expression and\ndoes not apply to any right created by the statute (see p. 275\nof Constitution of India by D.D. Basu, 14th Edn.). The above\nwords &#x27;in relation to&#x27; in <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_606\">Article 19(2)</a> are words of widest\namplitude. When the said words are read in relation to\ncontempt of court, it follows that the law of contempt is\ntreated as reasonable restriction as it seeks to prevent\nadministration of justice from getting perverted or prejudiced\nor interfered with. Secondly, these words show that the\nexpression &#x27;contempt of court&#x27; in <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_607\">Article 19(2)</a> indicates that\nthe object behind putting these words in <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_608\">Article 19(2)</a> is to\nregulate and control administration of justice. Thirdly, if one\nreads <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_609\">Article 19(2)</a> with the second part of <a href=\"/doc/927019/\" id=\"a_610\">Article 129</a> or\n<a href=\"/doc/207538/\" id=\"a_611\">Article 215</a>, it is clear that the contempt action does not\nexhaust the powers of the court of record. The reason being\nthat contempt is an offence sui generis. Common law defines\nwhat is the scope of contempt or limits of contempt. <a href=\"/doc/614338/\" id=\"a_612\">Article\n142(2)</a> operates only in a limited field. It permits a law to be\nmade restricted to investigations and punishment and does\nnot touch the inherent powers of the court of record.\nFourthly, in case of criminal contempt, the offending act\nmust constitute interference with administration of justice.\nContempt jurisdiction of courts of record forms part of their\ninherent jurisdiction under Article 129/Article 215. Superior\ncourts of record have inter alia inherent superintendent\njurisdiction to punish contempt committed in connection\nwith proceedings before inferior courts. The test is that the\npublication (actual and not planned publication) must create\na real and substantial risk of prejudice to the proper\nadministration of justice or to the fairness of trial. It is\nimportant to bear in mind that sometimes even fair and\naccurate reporting of the trial (say murder trial) could\nnonetheless give rise to the &#x27;real and substantial risk of\nserious prejudice&#x27; to the connected trials. In such cases,\nthough rare, there is no other practical means short of\npostponement orders that is capable of avoiding the real and\nsubstantial risk of prejudice to the connected trials. Thus,\npostponement orders safeguard fairness of the connected\ntrials. The principle underlying postponement orders is that it\nprevents possible contempt. Of course, before passing\npostponement orders, the courts should look at the content\nof the offending publication (as alleged) and its effect. Such\npostponement orders operate on actual publication. Such\norders direct postponement of the publication for a limited\nperiod. Thus, if one reads <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_613\">Article 19(2)</a>, Article 129/Article\n215 and <a href=\"/doc/614338/\" id=\"a_614\">Article 142(2)</a>, it is clear that courts of record &#x27;have\nall the powers including power to punish&#x27; which means that\ncourts of record have the power to postpone publicity in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_420\">                         238</span>\n                                         Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\nappropriate cases as a preventive measure without\ndisturbing its content. Such measures protect the media\nfrom getting prosecuted or punished for committing\ncontempt and at the same time such neutralising devices or\ntechniques evolved by the courts effectuate a balance\nbetween competing interests.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_258\">46. One aspect needs to be highlighted. The shadow of the\nlaw of contempt hangs over our jurisprudence. The media, in\nseveral cases in India, is the only representative of the public\nto bring to the notice of the court issues of public importance\nincluding governance deficit, corruption, drawbacks in the\nsystem. Keeping in mind the important role of the media,\ncourts have evolved several neutralising techniques including\npostponement orders subject to the twin tests of necessity\nand proportionality to be applied in cases where there is real\nand substantial risk of prejudice to the proper administration\nof justice or to the fairness of trial. Such orders would also\nput the media to notice about possible contempt. However, it\nwould be open to media to challenge such orders in\nappropriate proceedings. Contempt is an offence sui generis.\nPurpose of contempt law is not only to punish. Its object is to\npreserve the sanctity of administration of justice and the\nintegrity of the pending proceeding. Thus, the postponement\norder is not a punitive measure, but a preventive measure as\nexplained hereinabove. Therefore, in our view, such orders of\npostponement, in the absence of any other alternative\nmeasures such as change of venue or postponement of trial,\nsatisfy the requirement of justification under <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_615\">Article 19(2)</a>\nand they also help the courts to balance conflicting societal\ninterests of right to know vis-à-vis another societal interest\nin fair administration of justice.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_259\">47. One more aspect needs to be mentioned. Excessive\nprejudicial publicity leading to usurpation of functions of the\ncourt not only interferes with administration of justice which\nis sought to be protected under <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_616\">Article 19(2)</a>, it also\nprejudices or interferes with a particular legal proceedings.\nIn such case, courts are duty-bound under inherent\njurisdiction, subject to above parameters, to protect the\npresumption of innocence which is now recognised by this\nCourt as a human right under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_617\">Article 21</a>, subject to the\napplicant proving displacement of such a presumption in\nappropriate proceedings.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_260\">48. Lastly, postponement orders must be integrally\nconnected to the outcome of the proceedings including guilt\nor innocence of the accused, which would depend on the\nfacts of each case.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_261\">49. For the aforestated reasons, we hold that subject to the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_421\">                                      239</span>\n                                                     Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\n           above parameters, postponement orders fall under <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_618\">Article\n           19(2)</a> and they satisfy the test of reasonableness.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_538\">                      (italics in original, underlined by us for emphasis)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_539\">336.

What\n           constitutes an offending publication would depend on the\n           decision of the court on case-to-case basis. Hence, guidelines\n           on reporting cannot be framed across the Board. The shadow\n           of &#x27;law of contempt&#x27; hangs over our jurisprudence. This Court\n           is duty-bound to clear that shadow under <a href=\"/doc/882644/\" id=\"a_632\">Article 141.</a> The\n           phrase &#x27;in relation to contempt of court&#x27; under <a href=\"/doc/493243/\" id=\"a_633\">Article 19(2)</a>\n           does not in the least describe the true nature of the offence\n           which consists in interfering with administration of justice;\n           in impending and perverting the course of justice.

Ltd.</a> (supra), although not concerned with a criminal trial, had\nthe occasion to observe that at times even fair and accurate reporting of\na trial could give rise to a &#x27;real and substantial risk of serious prejudice&#x27;\nto connected trials and in such cases, which would be rare, there is no\nother practical means short of postponement orders that is capable of\navoiding the real and substantial risk of prejudice to the connected\ntrials. We are inclined to the view that the importance, necessity and\ndesirability   of   passing   postponement   orders   to   avoid     real   and\nsubstantial risk of serious prejudice in cases where the media out of\nover zealousness fails to make a fair and accurate reporting of a trial\nand to maintain the sanctity of administration of justice and fairness in\ntrial cannot, therefore, be over emphasized. More so, when the society as\na whole, as it ought to be, is vitally interested in the prevention of\nimproper convictions as also unmerited acquittals. Having regard to the\nfindings that we have returned, it may not have been absolutely\ninappropriate for us to make postponement orders. However, we propose\nnot to pass such order taking judicial notice that the hysteria caused by\nthe offending reports/discussions/debates/interviews pertaining to the\nuntimely unnatural demise of the actor appears to have calmed down\nalbeit the prejudice it has caused at the relevant time, as noted above.\nDuring the time the judgment on these petitions stood reserved, no\nfurther complaint of violation of rights of others by the media has been\nbrought to our notice.

While not proposing to issue directions for postponement of\nnews reporting for the reasons noted above, yet, bearing in mind the\nadverse impact that a trial by media could have on pending\ninvestigations (which was not the subject matter of consideration before\nthe Supreme Court in the aforesaid decisions), that an accused is\nentitled to Constitutional protections and invasion of his rights is to be\nzealously guarded, that there is an emerging need to foster a degree of\nresponsibility as well as promote accountability and the reason in the\nparagraph that follows, we do not consider it to be either impermissible\nor imprudent in the present context to maintain a fine balance between\ncompeting rights as well as having regard to the ever-changing societal\nneeds to suggest measures for exercise of restraint by the media in\nrespect of certain specified matters, with a view to secure proper\nadministration of justice, while it proceeds to exercise its right to report.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_553\">348.

Besides, the other rights that\nvarious individuals have under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_648\">Article 21</a> also call for protection.

Having given our anxious consideration to all aspects of the\nmatter, we are inclined to the opinion that the press/media ought to\navoid/regulate       certain    reports/discussions/debates/interviews        in\nrespect of and/or touching upon any on-going inquiry/investigation into\na criminal offence and that only those items are presented for\nreading/viewing and otherwise perceiving through the senses which are\nmerely informative but in public interest instead of what, according to\nthe media, the public is interested in. No report/discussion/debate/\ninterview should be presented by the press/media which could harm the\ninterests of the accused being investigated or a witness in the case or\nany such person who may be relevant for any investigation, with a view\nto satiate the thirst of stealing a march over competitors in the field of\nreporting. Accordingly, we direct the press/media to exercise restraint\nand refrain from printing/displaying any news item and/or initiating\nany discussion/debate/interview of the nature, as indicated hereunder:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_266\">   a.

These are not intended to be exhaustive but indicative, and\nany report carried by the print media or a programme telecast by a TV\nchannel, live or recorded, ought to be such so as to conform to the\nProgramme Code, the norms of journalistic standards and the Code of\nEthics and Broadcasting Regulations; in default thereof, apart from\naction that could be taken under the prevailing regulatory mechanism,\nthe erring media house could make itself liable to face an action in\ncontempt, i.e., criminal contempt within the meaning of section 2(c) of\nthe CoC Act which, as and when initiated, would obviously have to be\ndecided by the competent court on its own merits and in accordance\nwith law.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_436\">                                    247</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_564\">                                                    Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_565\">351.        It has been urged on behalf of the media houses that on\ndiverse occasions, the guests are invited to speak and address the\naudience on a particular topic during programmes which are telecast\nlive and, in such cases, it is difficult for the media houses to censor the\nstatements of such guests. What the media houses say could be true,\nbut that would not grant any speaker the license to either abuse or\ndefame any particular individual, who could be the target of the speech,\nto tarnish his reputation in the eyes of the viewers or to indulge in\ninterference with and/or obstruction to administration of justice by such\npublic speaking. In case of the former, the targeted individual could sue\nthe media as well as the speaker for defamation, which must ordinarily\nsound in damages but in case of the latter, both the media house and\nthe speaker may be proceeded against for criminal contempt. It would\nnot be enough for the media house to put up a disclaimer at the end of\nthe programme that it does not associate itself with the views of the\nspeaker and thereby evade liability. To obviate such situation, the media\nhouses would be well advised to inform, guide and advise the guest\nspeakers to refrain from making public utterances which are likely to\ninterfere with and/or obstruct administration of justice and thereby\nattract contempt. The role of the anchor, in such cases, is also\nimportant. It is for him/her to apply his/her mind and avoid the\nprogramme from drifting beyond the permissible limits. Muting the\nspeaker if he flies off or shows tendency of flying off at a tangent could\nbe one of several ways to avoid embarrassment as well as contempt.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_566\">352.        At the same time, while emphasizing on the need for a free,\nfair, effective and meaningful investigation of an FIR disclosing\ncommission of cognizable offence by an accused ~ be it a celebrity or an\nordinary person ~ to be conducted by the investigative agency, we also\nconsider it appropriate to remind the investigative agencies that they are\nentitled to maintain secrecy in course of investigation and are under no\nobligation to divulge materials thus collected. If indeed there is leakage\nor disclosure of materials, which has the potential of stifling a proper\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_437\">                                     248</span>\n                                                      Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\ninvestigation, it could pave the way for such information being laid\nbefore the competent court having powers to punish for cri6minal\ncontempt under section 2(c) of the CoC Act and in an appropriate case,\nfor being dealt with in accordance with law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_567\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"62107217\" id=\"span_438\">353.        That apart, one of the suggestions of Mr.Datar seems to us\nto be worthful and hence, we observe that Mumbai Police as well as the\nother investigating agencies may consider the desirability of appointing\nan officer who could be the link between the investigator and the media\nhouses for holding periodic briefings in sensitive cases or incidents that\nare likely to affect the public at large and to provide credible information\nto the extent such officer considers fit and proper to disclose and answer\nqueries as received from the journalists/reporters but he must, at all\ntimes,   take    care   to    ensure      that   secret   and     confidential\ninformation/material collected during investigation, the disclosure\nwhereof could affect administration of justice, is not divulged. Such\nofficer, if at all appointed, would nonetheless be instructed to bear in\nmind the decision of the Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/62107217/\" id=\"a_650\">Rajendran Chingaravelu</a>\n(supra). There, the Court warned of the growing tendency among\ninvestigating officers (either police or other departments) to inform the\nmedia, even before completion of investigation, that they have caught a\ncriminal or an offender and that such crude attempts to claim credit for\nimaginary   investigational   breakthroughs      should   be    curbed.     The\ninvestigating agency should refrain from such acts that would prejudice\nnot only the investigation but also the trial before the Court. We say no\nmore on this topic.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_568\">354.        Finally, what remains for our consideration is Mr.Kamath&#x27;s\nsuggestion that if any adverse order is passed by the UOI against an\nerring news broadcaster for violation of the Programme Code and such\norder has the effect of abridging the right guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_651\">Article\n19(1)(a)</a>, this Court may direct that the same as against the broadcaster\nwill remain in abeyance for a period of 15 days or so as to enable the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_439\">                                     249</span>\n                                                     Judgment-PILST.92252.2020+4\n\n\n\nnews broadcaster to approach the appropriate Court for relief. We do not\nconsider such suggestion worthy of acceptance. It is not open to the\nHigh Courts to further legislate when a legislation is in place. The duty\nof the High Court would be to interpret the law, if the occasion therefor\narises. It is only in exceptional cases where there is no legislation\ncovering a particular topic/subject but right of a subject is infringed or\nthreatened to be infringed that the court may consider attempting to\nissue guidelines/directions to be followed till such time legislation in\nthat behalf is made. While we have ourselves suggested measures that\nneed to be followed so as to enforce the right to life of individuals\naccused of criminal offences under investigation as well as laid down\nguidelines for media reporting on criminal investigation at the pre-\nchargesheet stage, the latter is with the obvious intent of marking the\n&#x27;lakhsman rekha&#x27; within which the media must operate to avoid\ncontempt of court. However, in view of the provisions of the CTVN Act\nand the CTVN Rules, it is considered unnecessary to make any direction\nof the nature suggested by Mr.Kamath.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_569\">355.
