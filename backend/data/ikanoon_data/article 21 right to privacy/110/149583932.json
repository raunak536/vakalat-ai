Muralidhar, J.:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">Introduction\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">1. Important questions of law arise for determination in this petition under\n<a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_1\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India filed by a teacher of classical music,\nand his wife (Petitioners 2 and 1 respectively), seeking a writ of habeas\ncorpus. These questions involve interpretation of the relevant provisions of\nthe <a href=\"/doc/185191195/\" id=\"a_2\">Mental Health Act, 1987</a> (‗MHA&#x27;) in light of the right to life, liberty,\ndignity and in light of the right to privacy and autonomy of an adult female,\nas guaranteed in the Constitution of India.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">2. The chief protagonist in this petition is a 23 year old woman, Z (name\nwithheld for reasons of privacy). Around 5 pm on 11th June 2017, Z was\nforcibly taken away from the residence of her music teacher in Khirki\nExtension, Delhi with whom she had been residing since she turned 18. This\nwas done at the behest of Z&#x27;s parents and brother, with the help of the local\npolice of Police Station (PS) Malviya Nagar, and an ambulance service. She\nwas taken away to a privately run mental hospital and kept there without her\nconsent till the morning of 13th June 2017. Pursuant to the orders passed on\n12th June 2017 in this petition, Z was produced before this Court on 13th\nJune 2017. Z returned to the Petitioners&#x27; residence that day on the orders of\nthis Court. But that obviously was not the end of the matter.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">3. In the hearings that ensued over the next few months, this Court heard the\nsubmissions of the Petitioners and Z, her parents and brother, the police, the\nprivate mental hospital and the ambulance service. The records of the police,\nthe private mental hospital and the ambulance service and the documents\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">W.P. (Crl) 1804 of 2017                                           Page 2 of 73</span>\n produced by the parents and brother of Z were examined. The Court was\nassisted by Mr. Raj Shekhar Rao, Advocate, appointed as Amicus Curiae.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">4. In the judgment that follows the Court has concluded that the forcible\ntaking away of Z from the residence of the Petitioners on 11 th June 2017 and\nher consequent detention at the private mental hospital till the morning hours\nof 13th June 2017 was illegal and unconstitutional and violative of her\nfundamental rights to life, liberty, dignity and privacy under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_3\">Article 21</a> of\nthe Constitution of India and <a href=\"/doc/10131995/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 19</a> of the MHA. The Court has passed\nconsequential orders fastening liability on each of the actors responsible for\nthe above illegal acts and awarded Z token compensation even while leaving\nit open to her to seek other appropriate legal remedies for further reliefs.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">The Respondents\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">5. The State of the National Capital Territory of the Delhi represented by the\nStation House Officer (SHO) of PS Malviya Nagar is Respondent No.1. Z&#x27;s\nmother, father and brother are Respondents 2 to 4 respectively. The Cosmos\nInstitute of Mental Health and Behavioural Sciences (‗CIMBS&#x27;), Delhi\nPsychiatry Centre, the private mental health facility at 35, Defence Enclave\nin Preet Vihar, Delhi, its Director Dr. Sunil Mittal, and the other mental\nhealth professionals associated with CIMBS - Dr. Sameer Kalani and Dr.\nRaj Mishra - participated in the hearings by filing their respective affidavits\nand producing the relevant record. The Almas Ambulance Service (‗Almas&#x27;)\nthrough its Director Dr. Israul Haque Shaikh, and its employees viz., Mr.\nAbdul Gaffar, Mr. Virender Kumar Mishra, and Ms. Anamika Tiwari have\nalso participated in the hearings by filing their respective affidavits and\nproducing the record. These parties have been represented by counsel. They\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">W.P. (Crl) 1804 of 2017                                             Page 3 of 73</span>\n have also filed their respective written submissions.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">6. The Court, therefore, considers it appropriate to formally implead\nCIMBS, Dr. Mittal, Dr. Mishra, and Dr. Kalani as Respondents 5 to 8\nrespectively. Almas, Dr. Shaikh, Mr. Gaffar, Mr. Mishra and Ms. Tiwari are\nimpleaded as Respondents 9 to 13 respectively.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">The background\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">7. During the summer vacation of this Court in 2017, this petition was first\nmentioned for listing on 12th June 2017. The Petitioners rushed to this Court\nconcerned about the safety and security of Z. The Petitioners stated that Z\nhad been residing with them since she was 18 years and had been learning\nHindustani classical music from both of them since she was 11 years old. Z\nis stated to be deeply interested in pursuing a career in classical music. The\nPetitioners stated that Z was unable to get along with her parents and her\nbrother. Once she turned 18, Z voluntarily moved in with the Petitioners at\ntheir residence. Since then, the Petitioners had been taking care of her.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">The first round before the MM\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">8. Unhappy that Z had left them, her parents instituted Criminal Complaint\nNo.255/1A/2014 under <a href=\"/doc/75880442/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 25</a> of the MHA in the Court of the learned\nMetropolitan Magistrate 10 (‗MM&#x27;) (South-East), Saket Courts, Delhi in\n2014. In the said complaint Z&#x27;s parents averred that there was a history of\nmental illness running in the family and that their daughter&#x27;s behaviour had\nundergone a drastic change since 2011. They alleged that their daughter had\nbeen enticed away by the Petitioners who had undue influence over Z from\nthe time when she was a minor. They alleged that their daughter was\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">W.P. (Crl) 1804 of 2017                                            Page 4 of 73</span>\n suffering from a serious mental disorder which required medical care and\ntreatment. They prayed for a direction that Z should remain under the care\nand control of her parents.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">9. The said complaint came to be dismissed by the MM on 29th April 2015.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_2\">In the said order, the learned MM noted that a chamber hearing was held\nwith the parties. One Dr. Sidharth Chellani, a psychiatrist who claimed to\nhave treated Z, appeared before the MM and explained his report dated 25th\nMay 2014. The learned MM noted that Z spoke about being harassed by her\nparents previously and how she had approached National Commission for\nWomen (‗NCW&#x27;) for redress. Z informed the MM that she was a major; had\nnever suffered from any mental ailment; had no intention of joining her\nparents and wanted to live separately.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_3\">10. In para 4 of her order dated 29th April 2015, the learned MM noted as\nunder:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">         ―I have heard the arguments advanced by both the parties, and\n         have gone through the material available on record and after\n         considering the medical records furnished by the complainant\n         regarding mental ailment suffered by the family members and\n         also the medical record of the alleged victim (Z) and after\n         giving a chamber hearing to both the parties, I am of the\n         considered view that victim (Z) is not suffering from any\n         mental ailment which can incapacitate her to take decision or\n         function to a normal day to day life. Further all the medical\n         records furnished by the complainant pertained to the period\n         when (Z) has allegedly left the house of the\n         complainant/applicant after attaining majority. Further the\n         report furnished by Dr. Sidharth Chellani does not disclose any\n         severe mental illness of the victim, therefore, the application is\n         not maintainable and the same is dismissed.\n</blockquote>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">W.P. (Crl) 1804 of 2017                                             Page 5 of 73</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">           Application is consigned to record room.‖\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_4\">11. Z&#x27;s parents allowed the above order of the learned MM to attain finality\nas they did not challenge it further. However, the above failed attempt at\nbringing Z back under their control did not deter them from initiating a\nsecond round of litigation. In 2016, they approached this Court with W.P.\n(Crl.) 1293 of 2016. In that writ petition, Z&#x27;s parents asked that they should\nbe appointed as guardians of Z.\n\nSecond round before this Court\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">12. The writ petition was heard by a learned Single Judge of this Court on\nfour occasions. It transpires that during the pendency of the writ petition, Z,\non the orders of the Court, underwent an evaluation at the All India Institute\nof Medical Sciences (‗AIIMS&#x27;). She interacted with about 3-4 different\ndoctors over the course of 6-7 sessions which involved history taking,\npsychological tests, and conversations. Among the tests administered were\nthe Draw a Person Test (‗DAPT&#x27;), Sack&#x27;s Sentence Completion Test\n(‗SCT&#x27;), and the Rorschach Inkblot Test (RIBT). The final report dated\n5th July 2016 of AIIMS stated that there was ―no indication towards\npsychosis (schizophrenia) or any other psychopathology‖. Overall test\nfindings indicated that the patient suffered from a great deal of stress as well\nas anxiety owing to the ―family conflict she is having‖. In the light of this\nreport, the said writ petition was dismissed as withdrawn. Therefore, the\nsecond attempt by Z&#x27;s parents to get her declared to be mentally unsound\nfailed.\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">W.P. (Crl) 1804 of 2017                                            Page 6 of 73</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\"> Z gets &#x27;picked up&#x27; by her parents\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_7\">13. Less than a year thereafter, on 11th June 2017, a letter was addressed by\nZ&#x27;s parents to the SHO of PS Malviya Nagar, the relevant portions of which\nread as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">        ―Our daughter is suffering from probable Psychological\n        disorder case and has left her residence from ...New Delhi and\n        is staying with her musical teacher ...at Khirki Extn, Malviya\n        Nagar. Our daughter is not in a position to take her own\n        decision and is totally under the control of guru couple. Doctor\n        has advised for immediate medical attention and psychiatric\n        treatment of our daughter. We, therefore, picking up our\n        daughter physically from your locality by Ambulance for her\n        appropriate medical treatment so that she can live her life freely\n        with the mainstream. This is for your kind information and for\n        submission to the Ambulance authority as the area is under\n        your jurisdiction.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">        2. It is also intimated that it is our presumption that our\n        daughter is being exploited by the guru couple....under the\n        pretext of teaching classical music. It is, therefore, requested\n        that the matter may be enquired properly and necessary inputs\n        in this matter will be provided to you by us.‖\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_8\">14. The above intimation did not mention that Z was above 18 years of age.\nIt also suppressed the fact that two earlier attempts by Z&#x27;s parents to have\nher returned to their control, by using the MHA, once before the learned\nMM in 2015 and another before this Court in 2016, had failed. A bald\nassertion was made to the effect that: ―Doctor has advised for immediate\nmedical attention and psychiatric treatment of our daughter‖. There was no\nmedical certificate issued by any doctor at this stage giving such advice.\nClearly Z&#x27;s parents had already by this time arranged for an ambulance for\nthe purpose of ―picking up‖ their daughter physically from the residence of\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">W.P. (Crl) 1804 of 2017                                            Page 7 of 73</span>\n the Petitioners for ―appropriate medical treatment so that she can live her\nlife freely with mainstream society‖. The letter revealed that Z&#x27;s parents\nwere only presuming that Z was being exploited by the Petitioners.\nTherefore, they asked that the ―matter may be enquired properly‖ with the\nassurance that they would provide inputs to the police.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_9\">15. Z&#x27;s parents state that they consulted Dr. Sunil Mittal, the Director of\nCIMBS on 22nd May 2017 at around 1 pm in his chamber and discussed\nwith him, in detail, the past medical condition of Z and the ongoing legal\ndisputes. They claim to have shown Dr. Mittal the Court orders, doctors&#x27;\ncertificates, and assessment reports and that the meeting went on for more\nthan an hour. Z&#x27;s parents claim that they decided on the aforementioned\ncourse of action on 11th June 2017 on the advice of Dr. Mittal. In an affidavit\ndated 23rd August 2017, Z&#x27;s father asserts:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">        ―I say that it was Dr. Mittal who had suggested to me that in\n        case I inform the Police that I will pick up my daughter for\n        medical examination from the Petitioner&#x27;s place, the hospital\n        authorities will be able to arrange an ambulance and supporting\n        medical staff for bringing (Z) to their Hospital for necessary\n        medical assessment and medical treatment. Accordingly, I was\n        provided with the contract details of ‗Almas Ambulance\n        Services&#x27; and subsequently I had acted as per the advice of the\n        doctor.‖\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_10\">16. Z&#x27;s father goes on to state in his affidavit that CIMBS maintains an\noperational connection with an ambulance service provider, i.e. Almas\nwhose contact details were provided to him by CIMBS authorities.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_11\">17. It transpires, from the affidavit dated 6th July 2017 filed by Dr. Israul\nHaque Shaikh, the Director of Almas, that they were approached by Z&#x27;s\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">W.P.

Dr.\nShaikh led the Almas team which comprised Mr. Abdul Gaffar\n(coordinator), Mr. Virender Kumar Mishra (male nurse), and Ms. Anamika\n(attendant). In the affidavits filed by Dr. Shaikh and the others of the Almas\nteam, it is claimed that at around 4.40 pm, Mr. Abdul Gaffar got a call from\nZ&#x27;s father stating that a police officer had also arrived and asked the\nambulance to reach the address of the Petitioners. According to Dr. Shaikh,\nthereafter the consent form was got filled by Z&#x27;s father. A copy of the\nintimation given by Z&#x27;s parents to the SHO, Malviya Nagar was also given\nto Dr. Shaikh. He found this to be stamped with the seal of PS Malviya\nNagar as DD No.19B at 10.05 am on 11th June 2017.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_12\">18. Among the documents given to the ambulance was ―an old prescription‖\nwhich was the handwritten observation dated 26 th May 2014 of Dr. Sidharth\nChellani. This was the same document that had been produced before the\nlearned MM and which was referred to in the order dated 29th April 2015\ndismissing the complaint of Z&#x27;s parents under <a href=\"/doc/75880442/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 25</a> MHA. In other\nwords, despite the above opinion being more than three years old, and not\nfound acceptable by the MM, Z&#x27;s parents persisted in using the same\nopinion to forcibly take Z away against her wishes.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">19. According to the State, on 11th June 2017, Z&#x27;s father called Head\nConstable (‗HC&#x27;) Praveen attached to PS Malviya Nagar, from his mobile\nnumber on the latter&#x27;s mobile number at 5.33 pm. It is claimed that HC\nPraveen was at PS Malviya Nagar at that point in time. This call was\nreturned at 5.45 pm by HC Praveen. The CDRs of the mobile phones of Z&#x27;s\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">W.P.

Petitioner No.1 gave a complaint (DD No.54A) to the SHO of PS\nMalviya Nagar, on 11th June 2017 stating that at around 5 pm Respondent\nNos. 2 to 4, along with 15 others, forcibly barged into the Petitioners&#x27; house.\nIt was stated that Petitioner No.2 who was 69 years old was beaten and\nbound. It was also stated in the said complaint that Z was forced onto a bed\nby 2-3 men (unidentified) and forcibly injected with a substance that caused\nher to faint. The Petitioners&#x27; home was ransacked and Z&#x27;s possessions and\ndocuments were taken by her parents and brother. It was also stated in the\ncomplaint that the Petitioners were forced to sign a document. Petitioner\nNo.1 states that she approached the plain-clothes policeman who was\npresent during the incident and informed him about the dismissal of previous\nlitigation by this Court. However, he took no notice of this information.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_16\">21. Petitioner No.1 called the police at No. 100 and when they failed to take\naction, she approached PS Malviya Nagar. In the status report first filed by\nthe SHO of PS Malviya Nagar on 13th June 2017, it was acknowledged that\nafter Z was taken away in the Almas Ambulance, a PCR call was received at\nPS Malviya Nagar (DD No.42A) at 6.15 pm. It was noted that the caller had\nstated that a girl was being forcefully taken away in an ambulance from a\nhouse at Khirki Extension towards C.R. Park. This was marked to Assistant\nSub-Inspector (ASI) Samsul Waris.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">W.P. (Crl) 1804 of 2017                                           Page 10 of 73</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_17\"> 22. DD No.45A of the same date recorded at 6.40 pm wherein the caller\nstated that the girl&#x27;s parents had beaten her up and given her an injection and\ntaken her away. The caller also gave a mobile number. It is not in dispute\nthat the earlier call at 6.15 pm was by an impartial bystander and the\nsubsequent call at 6.40 pm was made by Petitioner No.1.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_18\">The response of the police\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_19\">23. The affidavit filed by the DCP (South District), acknowledges the\npresence of HC Praveen at the spot when Z was taken away. It is, however,\nsought to be explained that HC Praveen could not determine whether Z was\nbeing taken away forcibly by her parents. The report of enquiry states that\nby the time HC Praveen realized the gravity of the situation, Z had already\nbeen taken away by her parents. Strangely, HC Praveen did not inform the\nsenior officials of PS Malviya Nagar of the incident. He filed a report only\non the following day.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_20\">24. Meanwhile, the Petitioners, along with their lawyers, went to PS\nMalviya Nagar and spoke to the SHO. According to the Petitioners, HC\nPraveen was present at that time. However, the SHO did not question him\nabout his involvement. The SHO purportedly refused to admit that a police\nofficer was present during the incident. The Petitioners point out that though\nHC Praveen was present in his official capacity, he was dressed in plain\nclothes. Such behaviour, it is contended, is not consistent with the claim\nmade by the Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) (South District) in his\naffidavit that HC Praveen and the SHO acted in a bona fide manner.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">W.P.

The complaint given by the Petitioners at PS Malviya Nagar was kept\npending. The reason given is that Z was unavailable to make a statement.\nShe was declared by the treating doctor at CIMBS to be unfit to make a\nstatement. The Petitioners point out that this is inexplicable given that it is\nhighly unreasonable to expect an abducted individual to be made available\nfor statement.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_22\">26. The affidavits of the Almas staff reveal that HC Praveen was informed at\naround 7 pm that Z was shifted to CIMBS. Why HC Praveen did not pass on\nthis information immediately to his senior police officers is not clear. The\nCDRs show that at 4.45 pm, the ambulance had left the premises of the\nPetitioners at Khirki Extension.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_23\">Events at CIMBS\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_24\">27. The Indoor File of CIMBS indicates the time of admission of Z as\n7.55 pm on 11th June 2017. Z&#x27;s age is noted as 23 years. Her date of birth is\nmentioned as 21st January 1994. The name of her father and mother are\ngiven. Under ‗Admission Diagnosis&#x27;, it is stated: ―Deferred (to assess for\npsychiatric illness, substance use disorder)‖. The signature of the\nattendant/patient at the bottom of the page is that of Z&#x27;s father. The Indoor\nFile itself appears to be a bunch of thirteen documents and on each page, Z&#x27;s\nfather appears to have signed. The consent is not given by Z. On page two of\nthe Indoor File, also, the signature is of Z&#x27;s father with Z&#x27;s mother signing\nas a witness. Even pages which are not applicable like ‗Admission of\nVoluntary Patient&#x27; and ‗Admission of Minor&#x27; have been signed by Z&#x27;s\nfather.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">W.P.

There are two medical certificates dated 11th June 2017 on pages seven\nand eight of the Indoor File. The first is signed by Dr. Sameer Kalani. The\ntime of examination is shown as 7.45 pm. The form reads as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">        ―This is to certify that I have examined Ms. Z d/o (Z&#x27;s father)\n        R/o [New Delhi]\n\n        and find that she is suffering from Deferred (to assess for\n        psychotic disorder, substance use disorder)\n\n        with features of\n\n        suspected substance use, harassment (sexual), staying with her\n        guru, suspected to be suffering from psychotic disorder,\n        suspicious against family members, refusing to go back home,\n        family has brought her today after allegedly fighting with her\n        guru and brought her to hospital for detailed evaluation and\n        treatment of psychiatric illness\n\n        due to which she is unmanageable at home, is dangerous to self\n        and others and it is my considered opinion that she should be\n        hospitalized in a specialized psychiatry unit for further\n        observation/evaluation and appropriate treatment.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">        He/she may be admitted at CIMBSs-Delhi Psychiatry Centre,\n        35 Defence Enclave, Vikas Marg, Delhi - 110 092.

In the above form the portion in italics is written by hand and the rest of\nthe form is pre-printed.

In other words, the diagnosis is in a standard template which\nis the same for each patient, seemingly to satisfy the requirement of <a href=\"/doc/50783427/\" id=\"a_8\">Section\n19 (2)</a> MHA.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_27\">30. Another identical form appears at page eight of the Indoor File which\nhas been signed by Dr. Raj Mishra, where what has been mentioned in the\nearlier certificate is reproduced verbatim with the time of examination\nshown as 10.10 pm. There is a third medical certificate, in the same form, on\nthe following date at 7 pm signed by Dr. Shobana Mittal. In other words,\nthree doctors, two on 11th June 2017 and the third on 12th June 2017 used the\nsame pre-printed form to give identical certificates for the purposes of\n<a href=\"/doc/50783427/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 19 (2)</a> MHA.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_28\">31. The conclusions in the pre-printed part of the above certificates viz., that\nZ was dangerous to herself and others and, therefore, should be hospitalized\ncould not have possibly been arrived at in the short time that the two doctors\nhad to assess her after she brought to CIMBS. The notes on the file\nmaintained by CIMBS in fact point to the contrary.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_29\">32. Under Section 19 (1) of the MHA, where a person is bought in as\nmentally ill person and sought to be admitted under special circumstances,\nan application would have to be made in that behalf by a relative or friend of\nsuch person if the medical officer in charge is satisfied that it is in the\ninterest of such person to do so.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_30\">33. In the present case admittedly, there was no application made by a\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">W.P. (Crl) 1804 of 2017                                            Page 14 of 73</span>\n relative or friend as required under <a href=\"/doc/45884421/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 19 (1)</a> of the MHA. The medical\nofficer in charge of CIMBS was Dr. Sunil Mittal. He was first required to\nsatisfy himself that Z was not capable of giving consent to observation and\ntreatment. Secondly, he had to be satisfied that it would be proper for Z to be\nexamined by two medical practitioners working in the hospital. As it\ntranspired, Dr. Sunil Mittal was unavailable at the time owing to the fact that\n11th June 2017 was a Sunday. According to Dr. Kalani, Dr. Mittal&#x27;s\npermission for admitting Z was taken over the phone.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_31\">34. Under <a href=\"/doc/50783427/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 19 (2)</a> of the MHA, the application under <a href=\"/doc/45884421/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 19 (1)</a>\nhas to be accompanied by medical certificates from two medical\npractitioners. One of these has to be a medical practitioner in government\nservice. The certificate is to the effect that the condition of a mentally ill\nperson is such that he should be kept under observation and treatment as an\nin-patient in a psychiatric hospital. The proviso to <a href=\"/doc/50783427/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 19 (2)</a> of the\nMHA states that if the medical officer in charge is satisfied that it is proper\nto do so, he can cause a mentally ill person to be examined by two medical\npractitioners working in the hospital itself instead of requiring any\ncertificate.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_32\">35. The time of admission as per the Indoor File was 7.55 pm. By this time,\nonly one medical certificate had been issued by Dr. Kalani. Therefore, the\nprocedure under <a href=\"/doc/10131995/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 19</a> of the MHA was clearly not followed. With Dr.\nSunil Mittal not being present at the time, the question of his being satisfied\nabout the need for Z&#x27;s hospitalisation in terms of the proviso to <a href=\"/doc/50783427/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 19\n(2)</a> of the MHA did not arise.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">W.P. (Crl) 1804 of 2017                                           Page 15 of 73</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_33\"> 36. The two medical certificates issued on 11th June 2017 were in a pre-\nprinted proforma. This cannot be accepted as a valid compliance with the\nrequirement of <a href=\"/doc/50783427/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 19 (2)</a> MHA given the serious nature of the\nconsequences that would ensue taking away the liberty of the person\nforcibly hospitalised in a mental health institution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_34\">37. A patient cannot be admitted merely for observation under <a href=\"/doc/50783427/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 19\n(2)</a> of the MHA. A patient has to be admitted for both observation and\ntreatment. In fact, the admission diagnosis had purportedly been deferred as\nrecorded on the first page of the Indoor File. It appears that she was\nexamined by Dr. Kalani at 7.45 pm and then by Dr. Raj Mishra at 10.10 pm.\nFrom the notes maintained at CIMBS, which have been produced before this\nCourt, it appears that at 9.30 pm on 12th June 2017, Dr. Kalani wrote in the\nIndoor File that ―(Z) has been met and informed that she would be leaving\ntomorrow and she is quite relaxed and comfortable. Discharge process to be\ninitiated‖. This is after stating that ―assessments need to be completed for\nconclusive diagnosis‖ and ―considering the absence of current active\npsychotic psychopathology, continued admission under <a href=\"/doc/10131995/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 19</a> of\nMental Health Act 1987 does not seem to be necessary‖.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_35\">38. If this was the situation on 12th June 2017 at 9.30 pm, there was no\noccasion for Dr. Kalani to inform Sub-Inspector (SI) Yogesh of PS Malviya\nNagar that Z was not fit for making a statement. Dr. Kalani&#x27;s note on the file\nat 10 pm on 12th June 2017 reads as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">        ―Patient&#x27;s IO Mr. Yogesh called now and has sent a police\n        officer from Malviya Nagar PS. He has directed that this police\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">W.P. (Crl) 1804 of 2017                                          Page 16 of 73</span>\n         officer will stay tonight in hospital campus to ensure that\n        patient&#x27;s family does not take her away tonight. Further, IO Mr.\n        Yogesh has conveyed that he will personally come tomorrow\n        morning around 10-10.30 am to take patient with him, which\n        should be conveyed to patient only. He has been told that (Z)\n        has been already informed about her leaving tomorrow.‖\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_36\">39. The Court viewed the CCTV footage which shows SI Yogesh\naccompanied by another police man walking into CIMBS and then entering\na separate room. However, it was maintained in the inquiry conducted by the\nDCP, pursuant to the orders of the Court, that SI Yogesh was not permitted\nto speak to Z and, therefore, could not record her statement that night. The\naffidavit of the Petitioners and Z reveal that she was, by this time, under a\ngreat deal of stress and was repeatedly asking to be released.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_37\">40. What is strange is a handwritten letter was given to SI Yogesh Kumar by\nDr. Sameer Kalani on 12th June 2017 where he states as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">        ―(Z), D/o (Respondent No.3) is currently admitted in our\n        hospital Delhi Psychiatry Centre-CIMBS, for purpose of\n        detailed evaluation and assessment (Psychological tests) to\n        elicit any psychiatric illness.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">        Currently as evaluation is ongoing, kindly she be taken\n        statement once assessments are completed. She will be fit to\n        give statement once her assessments are completed\n        (approximately within 3 days).‖\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_38\">41. On one hand, Dr. Kalani had made a noting at 10 pm that SI Yogesh had\nbeen told that Z had already been informed about her leaving the following\nday whereas, on the other hand, in the handwritten letter to the SI, he was\nseeking 3 days&#x27; time.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">W.P. (Crl) 1804 of 2017                                           Page 17 of 73</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_39\"> Order dated 12th June 2017\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_40\">42. All this was happening on the same day when this Court had passed an\norder, in the forenoon, directing the police to meet Z. The said order reads as\nunder:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">         ― 1.   The matter is taken on board.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">           2.   Issue notice.

The SHO of the concerned Police Station will\n                immediately visit the residence of Respondents No.2 and\n                3 to meet the daughter of Respondents No.2 and 3, i.e., Z.\n                The SHO will be accompanied by a lady police officer. It\n                will be responsibility of the SHO to ensure the presence\n                of Z in Court tomorrow, i.e., 13th June, 2017.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">         4. Dasti under the signature of the Court Master.‖\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_41\">43. The Court is informed by the counsel for the State that the above order\nwas collected before 2 pm and handed over to the SHO of PS Malviya\nNagar. However, it appears that this order was not in fact shown to the\ndoctors at CIMBS by SI Yogesh on the same day. This was a serious lapse.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_42\">44. The case of the police is that SI Yogesh reached CIMBS at 5.30 pm on\n12th June 2017 itself and submitted a request to Dr. Kalani for recording the\nstatement of Z and also apprised him of the writ petition filed in this regard.\nThe aforementioned handwritten letter of Dr. Kalani is claimed to have been\ngiven to SI Yogesh at 6 pm. However, all of this does not fit with the other\nevidence that has come on record.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_43\">Order dated 13th June 2017\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_44\">45. On 13th June 2017, Z was produced before this Court and a detailed\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">W.P.

Inter alia, the Court observed that the SHO of\nPS Malviya Nagar made no preliminary inquiry with regard to the intimation\ngiven by the parents of Z but had merely made an endorsement on the\ncomplaint assigning the task to HC Praveen for inquiry and necessary\naction.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_45\">46. The Court observed as under in para 21 and 22 of the order passed on\n13th June 2017:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">        ―21. The status report strangely on the one hand acknowledges\n        that the police facilitated the forcible taking away of Z at the\n        insistence of respondents 2 and 3 and on the other hand they\n        were also taking action on a complaint by the Petitioners about\n        Z having been forcibly taken away in an ambulance.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">        22. It is incomprehensible that the police acted to facilitate the\n        illegal taking away of an adult person against her wishes from\n        where she was staying without even making a basic inquiry.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_46\">        What is even more strange is that a team of a doctor, a\n        coordinator and two nurses also accompanied Respondents 2 to\n        4 and facilitated the forcible taking away of Z. If what Z states\n        is right that they have forcibly injected some substance before\n        her forcibly taking away, it is a very serious matter.‖\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_47\">47. This Court in the above order also commented on the conduct of the\ndoctors of CIMBS and the prima facie violations of the MHA. The Court\nmet Z, and also separately met her parents in the chambers. Since Z had\nexpressed her desire to go back to the Petitioners, the Court directed that she\nshould be allowed to do so right away without any hindrance from any\nquarter whatsoever. She was also afforded police protection. The Court\nfurther directed that Z&#x27;s medical examination regarding external injuries\nsuffered by her would be conducted on that day itself by the SHO\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">W.P. (Crl) 1804 of 2017                                            Page 19 of 73</span>\n accompanied by a lady Constable from any Government Hospital.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_48\">48. The Court ordered an exhaustive inquiry to be conducted under the\ndirect supervision of the Commissioner of Police. Notices were directed to\nbe issued to the staff of Almas as well as Dr. Raj Mishra and Dr. Sameer\nKalani of CIMBS. The parents of Z were asked to file their individual\naffidavits stating that they would not in any manner interfere with the\npeaceful life of Z and subject her to any sort of harassment. The case was\nthen directed to be listed for further hearing on 7th July 2017.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_49\">Orders thereafter\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_50\">49. On 7th July 2017, the Court noted that affidavits had been filed by the\nfather and brother of Z, in compliance with the earlier directions. Affidavits\nwere also filed by Dr. Raj Mishra and Dr. Sameer Kalani of CIMBS and\nDr. Israul Haque Shaikh, Abdul Gaffar, Virender Kumar Mishra, and\nAnamika Tiwari of Almas. Mr. Raj Shekhar Rao, Advocate was appointed\nas amicus curiae to assist the Court on the legal issues that arose in the\nmatter.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_51\">50. On 25th August 2017, the Court directed that the report of the DCP on\nthe enquiry that was ordered to be held by the Court be provided to learned\ncounsel for the parties. Mr. Mukul Talwar, learned Senior Counsel\nappearing for CIMBS, undertook to provide to the DCP all the relevant\nrecords available with them.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_52\">51. On the next date of hearing, i.e. 13th October 2017, on an application by\nthe Petitioners, the Court directed that the investigation of FIR No.231/2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">W.P.

The\nCourt clarified that this was not meant to delay the completion of\ninvestigation but to ensure that it proceeds in an impartial manner in\naccordance with law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_53\">52. On 15th December 2017, the Court was informed that a charge-sheet had\nbeen filed by the DIU in FIR No.231/2017. Copies thereof were made\navailable to all the counsel. The Court noted that an affidavit dated\n7th December 2017 had been filed by Dr. Sunil Mittal. The Court fixed the\nschedule of arguments.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_54\">53. On 19th January 2018, Dr. Sunil Mittal was directed to produce on an\naffidavit the original record of treatment of Z at CIMBS and all connected\ndocuments, both paper and electronic (including CCTV footage), within the\nnext three days and when deposited, it was asked to be kept in a sealed\ncover.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_55\">Final arguments\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_56\">54. On 17th February 2018, the arguments were finally heard. On that date,\nthe Petitioners tendered their affidavits in rejoinder to the affidavit of the\nRespondent No. 3 and an additional affidavit of Z enclosing a copy of the\nOutpatient Treatment note dated 5th July 2016 issued at the time of her\nexamination at AIIMS pursuant to the order of this Court in W.P.

The Court has heard the oral submissions of counsel for the various\nparties: Mr. Trideep Pais learned counsel for the Petitioners, Mr. Rahul\nMehra, Standing counsel for the State, Mr. Mukul Talwar, Senior counsel\nfor CIMBS and its doctors, Mr. Joydeep Mazumdar, learned counsel for Z&#x27;s\nparents and brother, Mr. Kamlesh Kumar Mishra, learned counsel for Almas\nand its staff and Mr. Rajshekhar Rao, Amicus Curiae. Their elaborate\nwritten submissions have also been considered.

At the outset, it stands clarified that this judgment pertains to the\nviolation of the provisions of the MHA and the Constitution of India and the\nresultant directions that are required to be passed by the Court. The Court is\nconscious that a charge-sheet has been filed in the criminal case arising from\nFIR No. 231/2017 registered at PS Malviya Nagar against the parents,\nbrother and other relatives of Z, CIMBS and its doctors and Almas and its\nteam. It is clarified that the said criminal case will be decided and orders\npassed by the concerned Courts in accordance with law uninfluenced by\nanything that might be said in this order.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_61\">58. Another caveat is that the Court is not discussing the provisions of the\n<a href=\"/doc/14507371/\" id=\"a_19\">Mental Healthcare Act</a> 2017 which has been enacted by Parliament. This is\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">W.P.

The 2017 legislation has been notified by the central government\nto come into operation only with effect from 8 th July 2018.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_62\">59.

The constitutional right to\n        the freedom of religion under <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_31\">Article 25</a> has implicit within it\n        the ability to choose a faith and the freedom to express or not\n        express those choices to the world. These are some illustrations\n        of the manner in which privacy facilitates freedom and is\n        intrinsic to the exercise of liberty. The Constitution does not\n        contain a separate article telling us that privacy has been\n        declared to be a fundamental right. Nor have we tagged the\n        provisions of Part III with an alpha suffixed right of privacy:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">        this is not an act of judicial redrafting. Dignity cannot exist\n        without privacy. Both reside within the inalienable values of\n        life, liberty and freedom which the Constitution has recognised.\n        Privacy is the ultimate expression of the sanctity of the\n        individual.

Among the nine primary types of privacy that were elucidated, one\nconcerned ‗decisional privacy&#x27; reflected by an ability to make ―decisions in\nrespect of intimate relations‖.

Bobde, J. explained as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_38\">        ―To exercise one&#x27;s right to privacy is to choose and specify on\n        two levels. It is to choose which of the various activities that are\n        taken in by the general residue of liberty available to her she\n        would like to perform, and to specify whom to include in one&#x27;s\n        circle when performing them. It is also autonomy in the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">W.P.

Exercising privacy is the signalling of one&#x27;s intent\n        to these specified others - whether they are one&#x27;s co-\n        participants or simply one&#x27;s audience - as well as to society at\n        large, to claim and exercise the right. To check for the existence\n        of an actionable claim to privacy, all that needs to be considered\n        is if such an intent to choose and specify exists, whether\n        directly in its manifestation in the rights bearer&#x27;s actions, or\n        otherwise.‖\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_68\">65. R.F. Nariman, J. pointed out that in the Indian context, a fundamental\nright to privacy would cover at least three aspects: firstly, the privacy\nrelatable to the physical body such as the right to move freely; secondly,\ninformational privacy which deals with a person&#x27;s mind and recognized his\ncontrol over the dissemination of material that is personal to him; and\nthirdly, ―the privacy of choice which protects an individual&#x27;s autonomy over\nfundamental personal choice‖. In a separate concurring opinion, Sanjay\nKishan Kaul, J. acknowledged that there could be invasion of privacy both\nby State and non-State actors and the right can be legitimately exercised\nagainst both.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_69\">66. Violation of one&#x27;s rights could be by state or non-state actors. The\nobligation to respect one&#x27;s rights is placed both on state and non-state actors.\nIn Justice K.S. Puttaswamy (Retd.) v. Union of India (supra), the\nconcurring opinion of S.A. Bobde, J., noted that ―common law rights are\nhorizontal in their operation when they are violated by one&#x27;s fellow man‖\nand ―he can be named and proceeded against in an ordinary Court of law‖.\nThe position is no different under the Constitution of India. While some of\nits provisions recognise the obligation of the State, some others recognise\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">W.P. (Crl) 1804 of 2017                                            Page 26 of 73</span>\n the obligation of non-state actors as well. For e.g., <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_32\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1942013/\" id=\"a_33\">15 (1)</a>\nspeak of the state obligation of not denying equal protection of laws and of\nnon-discrimination on grounds of religion, place of birth etc. However,\n<a href=\"/doc/1952106/\" id=\"a_34\">Article 15 (2)</a> talks of not subjecting a citizen to any disability, liability,\nrestriction or condition with regard to access to sops, public restaurants, use\nof wells, tanks, bathing ghats and roads etc. and thus, places that obligation\non both state and non-state actors. Likewise, <a href=\"/doc/1987997/\" id=\"a_35\">Article 17</a> which abolishes\nuntouchability and declares it to be an offence and <a href=\"/doc/705639/\" id=\"a_36\">Article 23 (1)</a> that\nprohibits trafficking in human beings and begar recognises the obligation\nflowing therefrom of both state and non-state actors.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_70\">67. An impingement of the freedom of speech and expression could be\nperpetrated by both the State and a non-State actor and an aggrieved person\ncould come to the Court seeking protection against such invasion whether by\nthe State or a non-State actor. Protection against an attack on the right of\nlife, liberty, privacy and dignity can be exercised not only against the State\nbut also against non-State actors. <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_37\">Article 21</a> places an obligation both on\nstate and non-state actors not to deprive a person of life, liberty, privacy and\ndignity except in accordance with the procedure established by law.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_71\">68.

They can be enforced against\nnot just the State but non-state actors as well. The mere fact that the\nenforcement of such rights might depend on State action or enforcement of\njudicial orders by the State will not detract from their horizontal nature. The\nhorizontal dimension of these rights enables an aggrieved person to invoke\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">W.P.

The writ jurisdiction of a High Court under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_43\">Article 226</a> of the\nConstitution is, therefore, invoked not only for assertion of the rights to life,\nliberty and a variety of fundamental rights against invasive State action but\nalso against invasive action by non-State actors, including individuals.\nIncreasingly, in the habeas corpus jurisdiction, this Court is approached by a\nlarge number of individuals and married couples praying for protection\nagainst invasion of their rights to life and liberty and ‗choice&#x27; by close\nrelatives and other non-State actors. Much of the exercise in the habeas\ncorpus jurisdiction by a writ Court is to forge remedies and shape reliefs for\nwhich persons whose rights of choice and, therefore, of life, liberty, and\ndignity are under constant threat from their own family members.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_74\">70. Therefore, in a habeas corpus petition, like in the present case, when the\nplea before the Court is that a person should be protected against coercive\nretributive action of her parents, for making personal life choices, the Court\nshall not hesitate to exercise its jurisdiction to grant relief. In effect, the\nCourt would be recognizing that the threat to the right of ‗choice&#x27; of a\nperson and thereby right to life, liberty, and dignity can very well come from\nthe person&#x27;s own parents irrespective of the age and gender of such person.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_75\">71.

The social values and morals have\n        their space but they are not above the constitutionally guaranteed\n        freedom. The said freedom is both a constitutional and a human\n        right. Deprivation of that freedom which is ingrained in choice on the\n        plea of faith is impermissible. Faith of a person is intrinsic to his /her\n        meaningful existence. To have the freedom of faith is essential to\n        his/her autonomy; and it strengthens the core norms of the\n        Constitution. Choosing a faith is the substratum of individuality and\n        sans it, the right of choice becomes a shadow. It has to be\n        remembered that the realization of a right is more important than the\n        conferment of the right. Such actualization indeed ostracises any kind\n        of societal notoriety and keeps it bay the patriarchal supremacy.

The\n        concern of this Court in intervening in this matter is as much\n        about the miscarriage of justice that has resulted in the High\n        Court as much as about the paternalism which underlies the\n        approach to constitutional interpretation reflected in the\n        judgment in appeal. The superior courts, when they exercise their\n        jurisdiction parens patriae do so in the case of persons who are\n        incapable of asserting a free will such as minors or persons of\n        unsound mind. The exercise of that jurisdiction should not transgress\n        into the area of determining the suitability of partners to a marital tie.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_82\">        That decision rests exclusively with the individuals themselves.\n</p>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">W.P.

In the present case, the trouble started for Z when she began to exercise\nher personal choice as regards her career and consequently her place of\nresidence. She chose to pursue a career in music and, therefore, spent more\ntime with her music teacher and his wife in order to fully involve herself in\nmusic. Notwithstanding that Z was an adult, her choices were evidently\nunacceptable to her parents. As is apparent from the written submissions\nfiled by them, Z&#x27;s parents are under a mistaken assumption that ―in case of a\ndaughter she remains a dependent on her parents till she gets married,\nirrespective of the fact that whether she has attained majority or not‖. This\nmistaken notion forms the basis upon which they have taken it upon\nthemselves to make Z&#x27;s choices for her notwithstanding that Z, having\nattained the age of majority, can exercise her free will uninfluenced by what\nher parents might feel or think.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_85\">79. Another troubling aspect of this case is that Z&#x27;s parents, proclaiming that\nthey were acting for the welfare of their daughter, have repeatedly attempted\nto have her declared to as be mentally ill simply because they do not agree\nwith the choice she has made. They even went to the extent of getting her\nevaluated by a psychiatrist, Dr. Chellani, way back in May 2014. Despite\nthat report of Dr. Chellani not being accepted by the learned MM who\ndismissed their complaint under <a href=\"/doc/75880442/\" id=\"a_51\">Section 25</a> of the MHA, the parents of Z, in\nutter violation of her right to informational privacy, have given a copy of the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">W.P. (Crl) 1804 of 2017                                             Page 33 of 73</span>\n said psychiatric evaluation to not only the doctors at CIMBS but even to the\nambulance provider, Almas.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_86\">80. Having evaluated the circumstances under which Z was forcibly\nremoved from the house of the Petitioners (where she was living of her own\nfree will) by her parents who acted in collusion with the local police of PS\nMalviya Nagar and the staff of Almas, the Court is unable to reach any other\nconclusion than to hold that Z&#x27;s fundamental rights to life, liberty, privacy,\nand dignity under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_52\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India have been\nflagrantly violated.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_87\">81. Furthermore, Z was admitted to CIMBS at the instance of her parents.\nHer father signed the admission forms while falsely stating that she was\nunable to give consent to being admitted. From the circumstances that\nemerge from the record it appears apparent to this Court that here again, Z&#x27;s\nparents have violated her fundamental rights to life, liberty, privacy, and\ndignity in collusion with the police, the ambulance service and abetted by\nCIMBS.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_88\">82. Even more troubling is the fact that Z&#x27;s parents suppressed material facts\nregarding their two failed previous attempts to get her to be declared to be\nmentally unsound. This resulted in the local police, the ambulance staff and\nthe doctors at CIMBS to proceed as though Z was indeed mentally unsound\nor suffered from some kind of mental illness which required urgent\ntreatment.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_89\">83. In the Court&#x27;s view, therefore, the actions of Z&#x27;s parents which were\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">W.P. (Crl) 1804 of 2017                                          Page 34 of 73</span>\n carried out with the aid of the local police, the staff of Almas, and the staff\nof CIMBS were in clear violation of Z&#x27;s fundamental rights to life, liberty\nand the right to dignity enshrined in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_53\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. This\nviolation of her rights was triggered by her exercising her freedom of choice\nas a female adult by choosing whom she wanted to stay with. The Court,\ntherefore, rejects the plea of Z&#x27;s parents that they acted in the larger interests\nof the daughter and in consideration of her well-being since their actions\nindicate the opposite.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_90\">The scheme of the MHA\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_91\">84. Before proceeding to examine the role of CIMBS in the episode, the\nCourt proposes to analyse the relevant provisions of the MHA. The MHA is\na statute that has provisions that might result in the deprivation of a person&#x27;s\nliberty. The scheme of the MHA is such that it contemplates both voluntary\nand involuntary admission of a mentally ill person in a psychiatric hospital\nor psychiatric nursing home as defined under <a href=\"/doc/166363552/\" id=\"a_54\">Section 2(q)</a> MHA. One such\nprovision which is relevant in the context of the present case is <a href=\"/doc/10131995/\" id=\"a_55\">Section 19</a>\nMHA which occurs in Part II, Chapter IV titled ‗Admission under special\ncircumstances&#x27;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_92\">85. In this context, it requires to be noticed that the MHA replaced the\nearlier <a href=\"/doc/128750983/\" id=\"a_56\">Indian Lunacy Act, 1912</a> (‗ILA&#x27;) which had become outdated.\nParliament acknowledged that mental illness was a curable conidtion and\nthat the attitude of society towards persons suffering mental illness had\nchanged considerably. It was realized that, ―No stigma should be attached to\nsuch illness‖. The Statement of Objects and Reasons of the MHA envisaged\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">W.P. (Crl) 1804 of 2017                                              Page 35 of 73</span>\n that mentally ill persons ―are to be treated like any other sick persons and\nthe environment around them should be made as normal as possible‖. It is\nwith this object in view that it was thought necessary to have ―fresh\nlegislation with provisions for treatment of mentally ill persons in\naccordance with the new approach‖. The broad scheme of the MHA is to\nregulate the establishment and maintenance of psychiatric hospitals or\npsychiatric nursing homes only upon obtaining a license. The Licensing\nAuthority (‗LA&#x27;) under <a href=\"/doc/118222833/\" id=\"a_57\">Section 2 (g)</a> means such officer or authority as may\nbe specified by the State Government to be the LA for the purposes of the\nMHA. As far as the National Capital Territory of Delhi is concerned, the\nState Mental Health Authority (‗SMHA&#x27;) constituted under <a href=\"/doc/79156896/\" id=\"a_58\">Section 4</a> of the\nMHA has been authorized by the Government of NCT of Delhi to be the LA\nunder the MHA.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_93\">86. The license thus granted to run a psychiatric hospital or psychiatric\nnursing home as defined under <a href=\"/doc/166363552/\" id=\"a_59\">Section 2(q)</a> MHA includes the power to\nrevoke the license. This has to be read with the State Mental Health\nRules 1990 (‗SMHR&#x27;) which prescribes the minimum facilities for treatment\nof all patients, the procedure for admission and/or detention in psychiatric\nhospitals and psychiatric nursing homes, etc. As far as Delhi is concerned,\nRule 25 (1) envisages an application for reception order by the medical\nofficer in charge or the husband, wife or any relative making an application\nin Form-7 or Form-8 respectively. Where the application is by a husband,\nwife or relative of a person who is alleged to be mentally ill, it has to be\naccompanied by ―necessary medical certificates‖ and such an application is\nrequired to be signed by such husband, wife or relative or friend and verified\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">W.P.

In\nother words, where a person is in a position to express willingness, then\n<a href=\"/doc/10131995/\" id=\"a_62\">Section 19</a> will not apply at all. <a href=\"/doc/90892556/\" id=\"a_63\">Section 15</a> MHA would apply when a\nperson, as in the present case, is not a minor and is capable of expressing his\nor her willingness to be admitted as a voluntary patient in a psychiatric\nhospital or nursing home.

It was submitted on behalf of CIMBS that since 11th June 2017 was a\nSunday, the medical officer in charge, Dr. Sunil Mittal, was not available. In\norder to satisfy the requirement of <a href=\"/doc/45884421/\" id=\"a_91\">Section 19 (1)</a> MHA, he was contacted on\nthe telephone by Dr. Sameer Kalani and, after being explained the diagnosis,\nconveyed his oral satisfaction that Z should be admitted as an in-patient at\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_51\">W.P. (Crl) 1804 of 2017                                            Page 43 of 73</span>\n the hospital.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_115\">102. The Court is unable to accept the above explanation offered by Dr.\nSunil Mittal. Incidentally, it may be mentioned that in order to buttress this\nsubmission, Mr. Mukul Talwar, learned Senior Counsel appearing for\nCIMBS, sought to place on record the text messages exchanged between Dr.\nSunil Mittal and the two doctors on the premises, i.e. Dr. Raj Mishra and Dr.\nSameer Kalani. The Court has not permitted the said text messages to be\nbrought on record because there was sufficient time for Cosmos to have\ndone so without waiting for the last day when the petition was being heard\nfinally. Nevertheless, it is not as though such text messages would have\nhelped the matter seeing as Dr. Mittal was obviously not even on the\npremises of the hospital.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_116\">103. Since the responsibility of arriving at a satisfaction as to a patient&#x27;s\nmental health under <a href=\"/doc/45884421/\" id=\"a_92\">Section 19 (1)</a> MHA is not meant to be delegated to\nanyone else, the satisfaction that had to be recorded had to be of Dr. Sunil\nMittal himself and no one else. In the present case, the satisfaction for the\npurposes of <a href=\"/doc/45884421/\" id=\"a_93\">Section 19(1)</a> MHA was two-fold: that Z, being a mentally ill\nperson, was unable to express her willingness to be admitted in the\npsychiatric hospital and further that her admission in the hospital would be\nin her best interest. This satisfaction could not have been arrived at by Dr.\nSunil Mittal by just listening on the phone (or by a WhatsApp message) to\nthe diagnosis of some other doctor, even though such doctor was a qualified\nmental health practitioner. Such an opinion could only be formed by Dr.\nMittal himself after interacting with the patient. Clearly that interaction did\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\">W.P. (Crl) 1804 of 2017                                           Page 44 of 73</span>\n not take place in the present case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_117\">104. Would it be impractical and unreasonable to interpret <a href=\"/doc/45884421/\" id=\"a_94\">Section 19 (1)</a> of\nthe MHA in a manner that makes it compulsory for the medical officer in\ncharge of the mental health institution to himself record his satisfaction\nabout the need for a mentally ill person to be admitted as an in-patient? The\nCourt thinks not. The Parliament has intended, as a safeguard, that when a\nperson is brought in by someone else, who could be a relative or a friend\nclaiming that such person is mentally ill and not in a position to express their\nwillingness to be admitted as an in-patient, the medical officer in charge of\nthe facility should himself be personally satisfied that such person is in fact\nmentally ill and therefore, unable to convey their willingness to be admitted\nin a mental health institution. If it is a holiday or for some reason the\nmedical officer in charge is not available for recording such a satisfaction,\nthen such a person will not be admitted on that day in the facility. That\nperson has to wait for some other day on which the medical officer in charge\nis available or, if it is an emergency, go to some other mental health\ninstitution for that purpose. These are matters that have consequences not\njust for the treatment but the liberty of the person. The least restrictive\nalternative has to be the guiding factor.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_118\">105. There are no two ways of looking at it. Since this is a special procedure\nand talks of special circumstances, the safeguard against an arbitrary and\ninvoluntary admission is that a qualified mental health practitioner who is in\ncharge of the facility would himself or herself be personally satisfied as\nrequired by <a href=\"/doc/45884421/\" id=\"a_95\">Section 19 (1)</a> MHA. There was a clear infraction of this\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_53\">W.P. (Crl) 1804 of 2017                                            Page 45 of 73</span>\n requirement as far as the present case is concerned. Dr. Sunil Mittal had\nnever personally examined Z on 11th June 2017 prior to her being admitted\nas an in-patient in the CIMBS.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_119\">106. Again, it was Dr. Mittal who had to record his satisfaction about\ndispensing with the two medical certificates from mental health\npractitioners, one of whom had to be in the service of the government in\nterms of the proviso to <a href=\"/doc/50783427/\" id=\"a_96\">Section 19 (2)</a> MHA. Here again, the file notings did\nnot show the recording of any such satisfaction by Dr. Mittal prior to Z&#x27;s\nadmission in the hospital that instead of the two medical certificates\naccompanying the application, two of the doctors in the hospital could\nexamine her. Therefore, there is a second violation of the statutory\nrequirement under the proviso to <a href=\"/doc/50783427/\" id=\"a_97\">Section 19 (2)</a> of the MHA.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_120\">107. On the contrary, CIMBS appears to be using a standard pre-printed\nform consisting of thirteen pages without bothering to find out whether Z\nwas in a position to express her willingness. It was presumed that she was\nnot in a position to give her consent and signatures were taken of her father\non all thirteen pages. In fact, the application submitted by Z&#x27;s father was not\nin accordance with Form-8 under Rule 25 of the SMH Rules. It was also not\nwitnessed by two persons, as required by the Rule.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_121\">108. Apart from dispensing with the requirement of the certificates, the\nCIMBS appears to have ignored the requirement of <a href=\"/doc/50783427/\" id=\"a_98\">Section 19 (2)</a> MHA\nwhereby two certificates were required for having a patient admitted as an\nin-patient. In the present case, the certificates are all by the in-house doctors\nof CIMBS, not one of them was a practitioner in government service. There\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_54\">W.P. (Crl) 1804 of 2017                                             Page 46 of 73</span>\n are three medical certificates - two dated 11th June 2017 and another dated\n12th June 2017 by Dr. Shobana Mittal. That certificate is anyway superfluous\nin the context of <a href=\"/doc/50783427/\" id=\"a_99\">Section 19 (2)</a> of the MHA and, therefore, need not be\nreferred to at this stage.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_122\">109. The two medical certificates dated 11th June 2017 are of Dr. Raj Mishra\nand Dr. Sameer Kalani. Both are psychiatrists attached to CIMBS - neither\nis in government service. The certificates given by them are almost identical.\nThe crucial portion of the certificates is in a printed form, as already noticed.\nIn fact, they had not come to a definitive opinion on the need for Z to be\nadmitted as an in-patient. That opinion has been deferred by both of them.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_123\">110. The doctors at the CIMBS overlooked what <a href=\"/doc/45884421/\" id=\"a_100\">Section 19 (1)</a> MHA read\nwith <a href=\"/doc/50783427/\" id=\"a_101\">Section 19 (2)</a> MHA required them to do. Unless the medical officer in-\ncharge was satisfied that Z was unable to express her willingness and that it\nwas in her interest to get admitted as an in-patient, Z simply could not have\nbeen admitted in the hospital. The justification offered by the doctors at\nCIMBS is that in order to determine whether she required hospitalization,\nshe was required to be kept in observation in the hospital after being\nadmitted as an in-patient. This is contrary to the scheme of <a href=\"/doc/45884421/\" id=\"a_102\">Section 19 (1)</a>\nMHA read with <a href=\"/doc/50783427/\" id=\"a_103\">Section 19 (2)</a> MHA.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_124\">111. In other words, it is not as if a person can be admitted to a mental\nhealth institution in order to determine whether they require such an\nadmission. The determination that she requires admission should be made\nprior to her actual admission and not later. In the present case, this basic\nrequirement has been violated. Z was admitted into CIMBS as an in-patient\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\">W.P. (Crl) 1804 of 2017                                             Page 47 of 73</span>\n without any clear determination as to whether she was required to be so\nadmitted. On the contrary, even by the end of the day on 11th June 2017, Dr.\nKalani came to the conclusion that Z did not require to be admitted as an in-\npatient. It had already been decided by then that she was going to be\nreleased on the following day.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_125\">112. Here, the Court would like to clarify that what <a href=\"/doc/10131995/\" id=\"a_104\">Section 19</a> MHA\nenvisages is that till such time the medical officer in charge records in\nwriting his satisfaction that the person is unable to express willingness to be\nadmitted and is mentally ill and requires hospitalization, such a person can\nonly be examined in the out-patient department. From those assessments the\nmedical officer in-charge will have to be convinced that such a person\nrequires to be admitted. In other words, the medical officer in-charge cannot\ndirect the admission of a person into the hospital as an in-patient without\nrecording such a satisfaction in the first place. Involuntary admission cannot\nbe recommended for the purposes of recording such a satisfaction.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_126\">113. There is no explanation offered for the failure of Dr. Sunil Mittal, as the\nmedical officer in charge of CIMBS, to himself examine Z and come to the\nconclusion that she requires treatment as an in-patient. The proviso to\n<a href=\"/doc/50783427/\" id=\"a_105\">Section 19 (2)</a> MHA which provides for dispensing with the certificate\nprocedure was in fact not satisfied in the present matter. One certificate was\nprepared at 7:35 pm and the other at 10pm and, therefore, both these doctors\nobviously did not examine Z at the same time. In the notes, it is sought to be\njustified by saying that Dr. Sunil Mittal was ‗consulted&#x27;. The notes do not\nthemselves say that he was spoken to over the phone. Clearly, he was not\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_56\">W.P. (Crl) 1804 of 2017                                            Page 48 of 73</span>\n physically present in the hospital. Consultation over the phone will never\nsatisfy the requirement under <a href=\"/doc/10131995/\" id=\"a_106\">Section 19</a> MHA. This is not a function that\ncould have been delegated by Dr. Sunil Mittal to anyone else. In the present\ncase, there is no justification shown by Dr. Mittal for a departure from the\nabove procedure.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_127\">114. In order to justify the action, it is sought to be contended by CIMBS,\nthat no advice was given by them to Z&#x27;s parents to get her admitted to the\nhospital for treatment. This Court finds this hard to believe. The out-patient\nrecords of CIMBS too reveal that Z&#x27;s father did consult Dr. Kalani. In any\nevent, it would not have been possible for Z&#x27;s parents to simply get Z\nadmitted to the mental hospital without first talking to the doctors there. It\nwould have also not been possible for them to know which ambulance to\nchoose without the advice of CIMBS. The affidavits filed on behalf of\nCIMBS in this regard did not satisfactorily address this aspect of the matter.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_128\">115. A vague statement is made that at the hospital, Z ―had not expressed\nher willingness to be admitted as a voluntary patient‖. Reading the affidavits\nof the parents, doctors of CIMBS and Z herself carefully and the fact that it\nis Z&#x27;s father who had signed all the documents, it is evident that from the\nmoment she was brought into the hospital, it was presumed by the doctors\nthere that Z was not in a position to express her willingness for treatment. It\nis just presumed that she was incapable of giving consent and that it was to\nbe her father who was to give consent.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_129\">116. This is a serious flaw in the entire procedure followed by the hospital\nunder the MHA. Notes made by the doctors who examined Z speak to the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_57\">W.P. (Crl) 1804 of 2017                                           Page 49 of 73</span>\n contrary. By 10 pm that day, Dr. Kalani had already come to the conclusion\nthat Z did not require any treatment as in-patient. Therefore, bypassing the\nprocedure under the MHA, i.e. the medical officer in charge having to\nsatisfy himself that the patient brought to the hospital had to be admitted as\nan involuntary patient under special circumstances, Z was without\njustification detained in the CIMBS on the night of 11th and 12th June 2017.\nFrom this moment onward, everything that was done by the hospital was in\nviolation of the MHA.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_130\">117. The fact that the term ‗mental disorder&#x27; has not been defined under the\nMHA does not mean that there is no responsibility on the doctors to first\nfind out if the patient is indeed suffering from any such mental disorder prior\nto getting her admitted to a mental health facility. The reference has been\nmade to the International Classification of Diseases and the WHO\nGuidelines, ICD-10 on ‗classification of mental and behavioural disorders&#x27;.\nIt is claimed that drug abuse is a mental disorder which requires medical\ntreatment.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_131\">118. It is claimed by CIMBS that the parents of Z gave her background as a\nperson who had a history of drug abuse and was suffering from mental\ndisorder and that they simply believed what the parents of Z said in this\nregard. The fact of the matter is that the CIMBS doctors never bothered to\nascertain whether Z was in a position to give her consent to the treatment\nthat they were proposing. Again, a vague statement is made that both\nexamining doctors ―were of the opinion that the patient possibly suffered\nfrom one or more mental disorders requiring treatment/admission‖. The\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_58\">W.P. (Crl) 1804 of 2017                                           Page 50 of 73</span>\n notes referred to are pages 59 to 62 of the patient medical records and pages\n22 to 24 of the loose paper compilation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_132\">119. The Court here first would like to refer to the certificates themselves\nissued by Dr. Raj Mishra and Dr. Kalani. In the relevant column, both\ncertificates have deferred giving any medical opinion that Z was suffering\nfrom any mental disorder. It is plain that the doctors at CIMBS are trying to\nobfuscate the obvious error in not first ascertaining whether Z was suffering\nfrom any mental disorder at all.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_133\">120. Repeated references have been made to the certificate issued by\nDr. Chellani way back in May 2014. This same certificate was used by Z&#x27;s\nparents to first transport her in the ambulance and then to get her admitted\ninto CIMBS. This was a three year old certificate. This certificate had\nalready been seen by the learned MM who first dealt with the complaint\nmade by Z&#x27;s parents way back in 2015 and was rejected along with the\nparent&#x27;s complaint that Z required involuntary admission into a mental\nhealth institution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_134\">121. While it does appear that Z&#x27;s parents suppressed this fact, it was\nincumbent upon the doctors at CIMBS, when faced with such a certificate\nwhich is three years out of date, to first satisfy themselves that Z needed\ntreatment and admission as an involuntary in-patient at the hospital instead\nof blindly acting on the basis of such certificate.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_135\">122. There was no basis whatsoever for either Dr. Raj Mishra or Dr. Kalani\nto announce a ‗Code White&#x27; and ‗Code Violet&#x27; alert. Code White refers to a\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_59\">W.P. (Crl) 1804 of 2017                                         Page 51 of 73</span>\n suicidal patient and Code Violet refers to a violent patient. Z was neither.\nThere was nothing which occurred during the evening hours of\n11th June 2017 that could have persuaded either of these doctors to come to\nsuch a conclusion.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_136\">123. A person brought to a mental health institution without her consent, and\nsought to be admitted faces a serious infraction of her life and liberty. This\ndictates the mandatory nature of the safeguards under the MHA having to be\nscrupulously followed. Unless a patient is actually found to be suffering\nfrom a mental illness which cannot be treated except by way of admission\ninto the hospital, such patient should not be admitted either as a voluntary or\ninvoluntary patient into a mental health institution. This is the scheme of the\nMHA itself and, therefore, a violation of the statutory procedure results in\nnot only incalculable harm to the person but also a serious violation of her\nconstitutional rights.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_137\">124. A reading of the notes preserved at CIMBS shows that apart from Dr.\nMishra and Dr. Kalani, there was also a clinical psychologist who was\nexamining Z. She too came to the conclusion that Z did not actually require\ntreatment as an in-patient. It is remarkable that overlooking all these notes,\nDr. Kalani simply decided to detain Z for one more night on the pretext that\nit would not be safe for her to return that night itself. This kind of conclusion\nis most inexplicable.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_138\">125. Z was an adult woman and was entitled to take her own decisions. The\nfact that she was never consulted and never spoken to as an adult who could\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_60\">W.P. (Crl) 1804 of 2017                                             Page 52 of 73</span>\n take decisions of her own accord is a serious failing on the part of the\ndoctors at CIMBS.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_139\">126. It is sought to be contended that this was a case ―involving physical\nabuse, alleged sexual abuse, drug abuse, history of mental illness and self\nharm‖. This submission is unfounded. The fact of the matter is neither of the\ndoctors who attended or talked to Z bothered to actually find out if she had\nsuffered any of the above abuses. They simply presumed that what Z&#x27;s\nparents were saying was true.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_140\">127. The Court is also not convinced about the explanation given by the\nhospital for not allowing SI Yogesh to record her statement in connection\nwith the complaint of abduction made by the Petitioners. Even on the part of\nSI Yogesh, he had the order of the Court with him and could easily have\nshown it to the doctors to ask them to comply with it immediately. This was\nnot done. There was a specific direction by this Court that the police should\nmeet Z and such a direction was binding on the hospital.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_141\">128. The notes kept by the doctors do not show that they were shown the\norder of the Court. This part of the narrative of both CIMBS and the police\nis not convincing. Not only was this Court&#x27;s order violated but Z was\nunnecessarily detained by CIMBS for a whole day and night which is totally\nunjustified and in clear violation of <a href=\"/doc/10131995/\" id=\"a_107\">Section 19</a> MHA read with <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_108\">Article 21</a> of\nthe Constitution of India.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_142\">129. The doctors admit that the essential aspect of <a href=\"/doc/10131995/\" id=\"a_109\">Section 19</a> MHA is the\n‗special circumstances&#x27; viz., that a person sought to be admitted as an\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_61\">W.P. (Crl) 1804 of 2017                                         Page 53 of 73</span>\n involuntary patient does not or is unable to express willingness for\nadmission as an in-patient. However, nothing in any of the affidavits states\nthat any of the doctors asked Z whether she was willing to be admitted as an\nin-patient. Z could not be expected to, of her own accord, express\nwillingness to be admitted as an in-patient. It would be unreasonable to\nexpect that a patient who was brought to the hospital in circumstances such\nas those in the present case would know the requirements under <a href=\"/doc/10131995/\" id=\"a_110\">Section 19</a>\nof the MHA. Therefore, this stand of the hospital cannot be accepted at all.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_143\">130. The submission of CIMBS on the question of the possibility of\nevaluating Z&#x27;s mental health as an out-patient is that there may be instances\nwhere a patient may not come back to the OPD for evaluation and therefore,\nit becomes necessary in such circumstances for the patient to be\nhospitalised. This submission is totally unacceptable to the Court. The Court\ncan only reiterate that the MHA is very clear that it is only a mentally ill\nperson who can be admitted to a mental health facility. Further, the\ndetermination as to the person&#x27;s mental health has to precede the admission\nof the person. It goes without saying that that there cannot be a presumption\nthat a person is mentally ill or incapable of giving consent. The Court\nconcludes, in light of the above discussion that the involuntary admission of\nZ to the CIMBS at 7.55 pm on 11th June 2017 was in clear violation of the\nrequirement of <a href=\"/doc/45884421/\" id=\"a_111\">Section 19 (1)</a> MHA read with <a href=\"/doc/50783427/\" id=\"a_112\">Section 19 (2)</a> MHA.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_144\">Repeated violation by the Delhi Psychiatry Centre?\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_145\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"288676\" id=\"span_62\">131.1 Two decades ago, in a judgment dated 1st May 1997 in <a href=\"/doc/288676/\" id=\"a_113\">Anamika\nChawla v.

The opening\nparagraph of the judgment reads thus:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_67\">        ―This case arises of alleged ill-treatment of Mrs. Anamika Chawla by\n        her husband and her father. The case is going on since 29th July 1995.\n        Smt. Anamika Chawla came up against the order passed by the\n        Metropolitan Magistrate on 29th July, 1995 ordering to be admitted to\n        Delhi Psychiatry Centre, 35, Defence Enclave, Vikas Marg, New\n        Delhi, for observation and treatment. This Order was passed with\n        undue haste even without seeing the alleged patient. Medical\n        certificates were produced from Dr. Sunil Mittal and Dr. S. C.\n        Malik. The case of the petitioner, Mrs. Chawla, is that neither of\n        the two doctors had ever met her or examined her. The allegation\n        appears to be true.‖ (emphasis supplied)\n\n131.2 The Supreme Court further observed in its judgment as under:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_68\">        ―The case has now gone on a number of days. We heard the Doctors\n        and examined the reports heard all the parties. Mrs. Chawla has\n        appeared before us personally on a number of days. We have spoken\n        to her on all these days. We have not noticed the slightest abnormality\n        in her behaviour.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_69\">        .............\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_70\">        We hold that there was no basis for passing the impugned order dated\n        20th July, 1995 by the Metropolitan Magistrate. The Order is\n        quashed. The Writ Petition filed in this Court by Anamika Chawla is\n        disposed of finally as above. There will be no order as to costs.‖\n\n\n131.3 If, for the second time around, Dr. Sunil Mittal has, without seeing a\npatient, agreed to her being admitted to the same Delhi Psychiatry Centre of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_64\">W.P. (Crl) 1804 of 2017                                           Page 55 of 73</span>\n which he is Director, then it is indeed a serious matter. It is shocking that Dr.\nSunil Mittal has repeated the violation that was first noticed by the Supreme\nCourt two decades ago. No action appears to have been taken against him in\nall these years and the pattern of his professional misconduct does not\nappear to have changed. The consequences for the victims of his misconduct\nare evident in both instances. The impunity with which this misconduct is\nimbued calls for immediate action by the Medical Council of India (MCI).\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_71\">Code of professional ethics\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_72\">132. The Court has asked both the amicus curiae and Mr. Talwar to address\nit on the ethical code of psychiatrists. It appears that under the extant scheme\nof the MCI there is no separate code of ethics for psychiatrists. There are\nForensic Psychiatrist Clinical guidelines published by the Indian Psychiatric\nSociety. While there is a lot of literature available on the treatment of\npatients and the protocol to be followed, there is very little on the code of\nethics for psychiatrists. For instance, the question of whether it is\nappropriate for a psychiatrist to issue diagnoses of mentally ill patients on\npre-printed templates is unaddressed. To this Court, such a practice reflects a\nnon-application of mind by a psychiatrist.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_73\">133. In the present case, the pre-printed portion of the form manifests a\npresumption that the patient is dangerous and unable to take care of himself\nor herself. How can this be a standard diagnosis for all in-patients? The fact\nthat identical certificates have been issued by the two doctors, without\nstriking off the inapplicable portions, further points to the danger of using\nsuch pre-printed forms. One can understand the use of the pre-printed forms\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_65\">W.P. (Crl) 1804 of 2017                                             Page 56 of 73</span>\n in the out-patient department of a government hospital for routine illnesses\nsuch as common cold, fever, cough, etc. where there is not adequate time to\nwrite out in hand the actual diagnosis. However, for a patient coming in for\nadmission on an involuntary basis or even, for that matter, on a voluntary\nbasis as mentally ill as envisaged by the MHA, it is inconceivable that such\na pre-printed form could be issued as a diagnosis.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_74\">134. If there is no code of ethics for psychiatrists in this country, it would be\nindeed a serious lacuna which ought to be remedied. An aspect of this matter\nwhich is disturbing is psychiatrists being able to talk to each other on the\ntelephone or through WhatsApp messages to decide whether a patient\nrequires treatment as envisaged. This again is totally unacceptable. It is\nillegal and has implications of unconstitutionality. A professional\npsychiatrist requires personal interaction with a person before making a\ndiagnosis of such person&#x27;s mental condition. It is inconceivable that a\npsychiatrist can determine the mental state of a person by merely discussing\nthe symptoms and conditions with another fellow psychiatrist over the\ntelephone. If this practice is being followed then it has to be stopped. A code\nof ethics must be formulated in this regard.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_75\">135. The MCI appears to be the common body dealing with all complaints\nagainst psychiatrists as well as other medical practitioners. The Court leaves\nit to the MCI to formulate a separate code of ethics for psychiatrists to\nfollow. Such a code will reinforce the law.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_76\">136. The Court concludes this part of the discussion by holding that the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_66\">W.P. (Crl) 1804 of 2017                                             Page 57 of 73</span>\n practice adopted in the present case by Dr. Sunil Mittal, Dr. Raj Mishra, and\nDr. Sameer Kalani was in violation of the law, the professional medical\nethics and norms. They failed to satisfy themselves about the capacity of Z\nto give consent to treatment. Z was forcibly kept by them at the CIMBS\nwithout her consent in violation of the MHA and the Constitution of India.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_77\">137. In view of such a serious breach of the law and professional ethics,\naction ought to be taken against the above doctors by the MCI. However, the\nquestion as to what action is to be taken against each of them is left to the\nMCI to decide. MCI will take note of this being the second known instance\nin twenty years of violation of the law and ethics by Dr. Sunil Mittal and the\nDelhi Psychiatry Centre.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_78\">138. On her part, Z is permitted to file a formal complaint with the MCI\nrelying upon the affidavits and records submitted by CIMBS in this matter.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_146\">If such complaint is filed, it is expected that the MCI will deal with it\npromptly and render a decision no later than six months from the date of\nreceiving such complaints.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_147\">Role of the ambulance Almas\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_148\">139. The Court now turns to the role of the ambulance staff that\naccompanied Z. In the first place, it must be noticed that Dr. Israul Haque is\nin fact not an allopath at all. He holds a degree in Ayurvedic medicine. It is\ntherefore pertinent to ask whether a person holding a degree in Ayurvedic\nmedicine can be permitted to operate an ambulance which might have to\ncater to patients who require specialised treatment and care?\n</p>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_67\">W.P. (Crl) 1804 of 2017                                          Page 58 of 73</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_149\"> 140. It is disturbing to note that this ambulance run by Almas is registered in\nHaryana but does not satisfy the requirements of the guidelines for running\nsuch ambulance in Haryana. The anomaly is that since it does not operate in\nHaryana but in Delhi then there is no action against such ambulance possible\nin Haryana. As far as Delhi is concerned, the ambulance does not satisfy the\nrequirements for running such an ambulance in Delhi either. However, since\nthe vehicle is registered in Haryana, Almas is able to get away by taking a\nstand that they are not required to satisfy the requirements of running an\nambulance in Delhi. This is how an ambulance which does not satisfy the\nguidelines in both for Haryana and Delhi is able to operate an ambulance in\nDelhi and that too by a doctor who is not an allopathic doctor but a holder of\na degree in Ayurvedic medicine. Clearly the ambulance does not satisfy the\nrequirements of Central Guidelines for running an ambulance. This is again\na serious lacuna in law which requires to be addressed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_150\">141. It appears that Almas simply made the services available without taking\nany basic precaution of satisfying themselves that this was a genuine\ncomplaint of a person suffering from mental illness. They appeared to have\nfollowed no protocol whatsoever and had simply gone by the application\nsubmitted by Z&#x27;s father which was enclosed with the three year old notes of\nDr. Chellani. It should not have been so naive as to act on the basis of a\nthree year old certificate to determine that the patient that they were carrying\nin the ambulance was incapable of taking her own decisions.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_151\">142. The manner in which the ambulance staff has been used to forcibly take\nZ away from the home of the Petitioners is illegal and unconstitutional. They\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_68\">W.P. (Crl) 1804 of 2017                                            Page 59 of 73</span>\n have all been party to depriving Z of her liberty and virtually rendering her\ninto the custody of the hospital without her consent. Almas has to be\nrestrained from offering this type of ambulance services.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_152\">143. It has been pointed out by the learned amicus curiae that Almas which\nis registered in Delhi as an Ambulance Service Provider company was\nincorporated on 4th October 2012 and, therefore, the revised Guidelines for\nRegistration of Ambulances in Delhi would apply. In terms thereof, ―An\nambulance vehicle can be registered by the Transport Department in Delhi\nonly after it has the approval of Committee for Registration of Ambulances\n(CRA)‖. It is unclear from the records whether the ambulance in the present\ncase has been registered as per the guidelines.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_153\">144. The learned amicus curiae has also pointed out that the guidelines\nrequired the presence of a medical control physician who would be required\nto give an undertaking that he shall be responsible for maintaining the\nquality of the service provided in the ambulance. It is pointed out that there\nis a lacuna inasmuch as neither the guidelines nor the National Ambulance\nCode AIS:125 approved by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways\nprescribe for or regulate the provision of service by the staff of the\nambulance and this is a lacuna that requires to be addressed and remedied.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_154\">145. A copy of the intimation letter from Z&#x27;s parents to the police was\nhanded over to Almas. The letter noted that Z was suffering from a\n―probable psychological disorder‖. The consent form for Almas for shifting\npsychiatric patients clearly stipulates ―Authorization of shifting of\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_69\">W.P. (Crl) 1804 of 2017                                          Page 60 of 73</span>\n psychiatry patient to hospital/rehabilitation centre for diagnostic/therapeutic\nprocedure‖. Therefore, there is a presumption that the medical control\nphysician present in the ambulance would conduct a preliminary\nexamination or perform a diagnosis in order to determine whether the person\nto be transported is in fact a psychiatric patient or not. Such preliminary\nexamination was even more necessary in the present case considering the\nintimation letter only mentioned a ―probably psychological disorder‖.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_155\">146. From the complaint of the Petitioner No.1 to the SHO of PS Malviya\nNagar given on 11th July 2017 itself and the statement of the Petitioner No.1\nand Z&#x27;s own statement under Section 164 Cr PC, it is plain that some form\nof drug/anaesthetic substance was administered to Z without ascertaining\nwhether she in fact was a psychiatric patient. The Court agrees with the\nsubmission of learned amicus curiae that the ambulance staff grossly\nneglected the duty of care owed to Z. They proceeded to abet the abduction\nof Z and administered drugs to her by injection in the absence of any\nmedical records and on the mere say so of Z&#x27;s family. This indeed appears to\nbe a fit case for revocation of the registration of the ambulance company if,\nindeed, it is so registered. A peremptory direction is issued to the\nGovernment of NCT of Delhi to take action in regard to Almas and such\nambulances which have been registered outside the NCT of Delhi but are\noperating in Delhi with impunity and in violation of the applicable\nguidelines.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_156\">Role of the police\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_157\">147. Turning now to the police, the report of inquiry submitted to this Court\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_70\">W.P. (Crl) 1804 of 2017                                           Page 61 of 73</span>\n by the DCP seeks to give a clean chit to HC Praveen who is attached to PS\nMalviya Nagar. HC Praveen went to the house of the Petitioners in plain\nclothes. He actually oversaw the forcible taking away of Z from the house of\nthe Petitioners. The DCP&#x27;s report puts out a weak defence for HC Praveen\nand seeks to project that he was acting in a bona fide manner.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_158\">148. When a group of persons barges into a house, pins down a person\nforcibly, injects her with a sedative, and tries to take her away in an\nambulance, a policeman cannot possibly be under the bona fide belief that\nall this was done in her best interest. Clearly, HC Praveen failed in his duty\nof protecting the life and liberty of a citizen. He should not have allowed Z\nto be taken away forcibly by her parents in the above violent manner. He\nalso did not inform the Petitioners about where Z was taken. The report of\ninquiry of the DCP clearly shows that HC Praveen was present at the\nPetitioners&#x27; residence at around 5 pm. HC Praveen cannot possibly take the\ndefence that he did not know where Z has been taken in the ambulance. It is\ndisconcerting that despite these lapses no disciplinary action has been taken\nagainst HC Praveen.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_159\">149. The role of SI Yogesh was also hugely problematic. Instead of acting\npromptly on the complaint given by the Petitioners, he walked into the\nhospital in the late hours. When the doctors in CIMBS told him that Z was\nnot fit to speak to him, he does not appear to have shown them the order of\nthis Court dated 12th June 2017 directing that he should meet Z and record\nher statement. The report of the DCP does not address this part at all.\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_71\">W.P. (Crl) 1804 of 2017                                           Page 62 of 73</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_160\"> 150. The delay in the registration of the FIR on the complaint of the\nPetitioners in the present case is unacceptable considering that the complaint\nclearly named the persons responsible for the abduction. The role of SI\nYogesh Kumar needs to be probed further to ascertain whether he was\nacting in a bona fide manner and whether in fact he communicated the order\nof this Court to the staff at CIMBS. If he did not do so, he has much to\nanswer for.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_161\">151. The Court would, therefore, direct that a full-fledged inquiry be\nconducted by the police into the roles of SI Yogesh Kumar and HC Praveen\nin this entire matter. Further, on the aspect of violations of the MHA, the\nDelhi Police appears to have left it to the Secretary (Health) GNCTD who is\napparently enquiring into the matter. The Court directs the Secretary\n(Health) GNCTD to share with the Delhi Police within four weeks the report\nof such enquiry and for the Delhi Police to take further action in accordance\nwith law in terms of such report.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_162\">152. The Court considers it appropriate to direct that the Delhi Police shall\nprepare a manual detailing how to deal with cases under the MHA and, after\n7th July 2018, the <a href=\"/doc/14507371/\" id=\"a_114\">Mental Healthcare Act</a> 2017. It must prepare a protocol in\nconsultation with legal experts as well as experts in mental healthcare and\nspread awareness on the issue of mental health. The Central and State\nMental Health Authorities must, in collaboration with the State Judicial\nAcademies, hold programmes on periodic basis with civil society groups,\nResident&#x27;s Welfare Associations, Police Officers, lawyers and Judges to\nsensitize them about the various compliances under the MHA and its\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_72\">W.P.

The Court is conscious that a charge sheet has been filed and a criminal\ncase has been registered and, therefore, the Court would not like to say\nanything more on the criminal culpability of these persons being conscious\nof the fact that the degree of proof of criminal culpability is higher.\nHowever, the Court would be failing in its constitutional duty if it did not\npronounce on the serious violations of the right to life and personal liberty\nexperienced by Z which more than adequately stands established in the\npresent case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_165\">154.

As to the plea on behalf of the appellants that the affidavits\n        on their behalf should not have been rejected by the High Court\n        without a factual enquiry, we would comment that the High\n        Court ought to have added that it was open to the first\n        respondent to file a suit against the appellants to claim\n        damages, if so advised. In that event a trial on facts would have\n        been necessary and would have taken place. As it is, Budha\n        Singh was last seen in the company of security forces, now 16\n        years ago. The security forces must, therefore, be held to be\n        liable to make payment of the aforestated nominal amount of\n        rupees one lakh to the 1st respondent.‖\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_82\">W.P.

The compensation amounts will be paid by\ndemand draft in Z&#x27;s name, within four weeks from today, and will be\ndeposited by Z in her own account.

The conclusions and directions of the Court in this judgment are\nsummarised as under:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_84\">(i) Protection against an attack on the right of life, liberty, privacy and\ndignity can be sought not only against the State but also against non-State\nactors. <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_128\">Article 21</a> places an obligation both on state and non-state actors not\nto deprive a person of life, liberty, privacy and dignity except in accordance\nwith the procedure established by law.

In effect, the Court would be recognizing that the\nthreat to the right of ‗choice&#x27; of a person and thereby right to life, liberty,\nprivacy and dignity can very well come from the person&#x27;s own parents\nirrespective of the age and gender of such person.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_176\">(iii) The actions of Z&#x27;s parents in removing her forcibly from the Petitioners&#x27;\nresidence and getting her admitted without her consent to the CIMBS on 11th\nJune 2017, with the aid of the local police, the staff of Almas, and the staff\nof CIMBS, was in clear violation of Z&#x27;s fundamental rights to life, liberty\nand the right to dignity enshrined in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_134\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. This\nviolation of her rights was triggered by her exercising her freedom of choice\nas a female adult by choosing to leave her home, and deciding where she\nwould like to reside. The Court rejects the plea of Z&#x27;s parents that they acted\nin the larger interests of their daughter and in consideration of her well-being\nsince their actions indicate the opposite.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_177\">(iv) The procedure for involuntary admission under <a href=\"/doc/10131995/\" id=\"a_135\">Section 19</a> MHA is only\napplicable when the person has been found to be mentally ill as required by\nlaw and a satisfaction has been reached to that end.

The medical officer in-charge cannot delegate this crucial\nfunction of the recording of the satisfaction of two separate kinds to some\nother person.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_179\">(vi) In the present case, the satisfaction for the purposes of <a href=\"/doc/45884421/\" id=\"a_143\">Section 19 (1)</a>\nMHA could not have been arrived at by Dr. Sunil Mittal by just listening to\nhis colleagues on the phone (or by a WhatsApp message). Such satisfaction\ncould have been arrived at by Dr. Sunil Mittal only after interacting with Z.\nClearly that interaction did not take place in the present case.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_180\">(vii) A person cannot be admitted to a mental health institution in order to\ndetermine whether she requires such admission. The determination that she\nrequires admission should be prior to her admission and not later. The\ninvoluntary admission of Z to the CIMBS at 7.55 pm on 11th June 2017 was,\ntherefore, in clear violation of the requirement of <a href=\"/doc/45884421/\" id=\"a_144\">Section 19 (1)</a> MHA read\nwith <a href=\"/doc/50783427/\" id=\"a_145\">Section 19 (2)</a> MHA.\n</p>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_86\">W.P.
