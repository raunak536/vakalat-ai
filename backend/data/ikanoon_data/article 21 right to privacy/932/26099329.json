The story of the prosecution, in brief, is that in the\n\n    month of September, 2015, when the victim was present at\n\n    her house in village &#x27;A&#x27;, she received a telephonic call from\n\n\n\n\n                                                               .\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_10\">    respondent No. 4 Mithin @ Sahil, who asked her to go to &#x27;B&#x27;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_11\">    The victim came to &#x27;B&#x27;, where the respondents Mohinder,\n\n\n\n\n\n    Mithin @ Sahil, Ajay and another person met her. On asking\n\n    this person, he disclosed that he was employed in veterinary\n\n\n\n\n                                      of\n    dispensary at &#x27;BE&#x27;. They offered cold drink to the victim. The\n\n    respondents Mohinder and Ajay took the victim to &#x27;BE&#x27; on a\n                  rt\n    motorcylce and thereafter she became unconscious. When the\n\n    victim regained her conscious, she found herself without\n\n    clothes and noticed that the respondent Ajay Kumar was\n\n    making    her videography and respondents Mohinder, Ved\n\n\n\n    Prakash and Ajay were sexually assaulting her. Thereafter, she\n\n    again became unconscious and when she regained conscious\n\n\n\n\n    she asked the respondents to take her to her house and\n\n\n\n\n\n    thereafter they left her at her house.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_12\">    3.          The victim thereafter used to talk with Mithin @\n\n\n\n\n\n    Sahil on his mobile, but Mithin, according to her, had not\n\n    committed any sexual assault with her. Thereafter, victim\n\n    came to know that her photographs were uploaded on\n\n    Whatsapp. Thereafter, she told this fact to her parents and\n\n    consequently FIR came to be registered on 05.05.2016 i.e.\n\n    after eight (8) months of the incident.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                              ::: Downloaded on - 06/09/2023 21:27:38 :::CIS</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                    3</span>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_13\">    4.

At the outset, it needs to be observed that rape is\n\n\n\n\n                                        of\n    a crime not against an individual but a crime which destroys\n\n    the basic equilibrium of the social atmosphere. &quot;Rape&quot; not\n                  rt\n    only lowers the dignity of a woman but also mars her\n\n    reputation. The plight of the woman and shock suffered by the\n\n    victim can be well visualized. The victim of rape grows with\n\n    traumatic experience and an unforgettable shame haunted by\n\n\n\n    the memory of the disaster forcing her to a state of terrifying\n\n    melancholia. The torment on the victim has the potentiality to\n\n\n\n\n    corrode the poise and equanimity of any civilized society. It\n\n\n\n\n\n    has been rightly said that whereas a murderer destroys the\n\n    physical frame of a victim, a rapist degrades and defiles the\n\n\n\n\n\n    soul of a helpless female. The offence of &quot;Rape&quot; is grave by its\n\n    nature, which warrants a strong deterrent by judicial hand.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\">    10.         <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"255210\" id=\"span_8\">In <a href=\"/doc/255210/\" id=\"a_13\">State of Punjab vs. Ramdev Singh</a>, AIR\n\n    2004 SC 1290, the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court held as under:-</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">               This Court dealt with the issue and held that rape is\n               violative of victim&#x27;s fundamental right under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_14\">Article 21</a>\n               of the Constitution.

Sexual violence, apart\n              from being a dehumanizing act, is an unlawful intrusion\n              on the right of privacy and sanctity of a woman. It is a\n              serious blow to her supreme honour and offends her\n\n\n\n\n                                                                   .\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">              self-esteem and dignity as well. It degrades and\n\n\n\n\n\n              humiliates the victim and where the victim is a helpless\n              innocent child or a minor, it leaves behind a traumatic\n\n\n\n\n\n              experience. A rapist not only causes physical injuries,\n              but leaves behind a scar on the most cherished\n              position    of   a    woman,      i.e.    her    dignity,    honour,\n\n\n\n\n                                          of\n              reputation and chastity. Rape is not only an offence\n              against the person of a woman, rather a crime against\n              the entire society. It is a crime against basic human\n                 rt\n              rights     and   also       violates     the     most\n              fundamental right guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_15\">Article 21</a> of the\n                                                                          cherished\n\n              Constitution.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\">    11.        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"60548682\" id=\"span_11\">In <a href=\"/doc/60548682/\" id=\"a_16\">Jugendra Singh Vs.

The\n\n\n\n\n\n              consequential death is more horrendous. It is to be\n              kept in mind that an offence against the body of a\n\n\n\n\n\n              woman lowers her dignity and mars her reputation. It is\n              said that one&#x27;s physical frame is his or her temple. No\n              one has any right of encroachment. An attempt for the\n              momentary pleasure of the accused has caused the\n              death of a child and had a devastating effect on her\n              family and, in the ultimate eventuate, on the collective\n              at large. When a family suffers in such a manner, the\n              society as a whole is compelled to suffer as it creates\n              an incurable dent in the fabric of the social milieu.

When\n\n\n\n\n\n    the victim makes not only a bald but vague statement where\n\n    even the date of incident was not mentioned, then it creates a\n\n    serious doubt about the story put-forth by the victim herself.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_45\">    25.

As observed above, the specific case of the victim\n                  rt\n    is that all the respondents had committed sexual offence with\n\n    her and threatened her but in her statement under <a href=\"/doc/497457/\" id=\"a_25\">Section\n\n    164</a> Cr.P.C.

In this context, one would have to fall back on the\n\n    medical examination.

It is\n\n    thereafter, she agreed for medical examination on the basis of\n\n    which MLC Ext.

It is true that injury is not a sine qua non whether\n\n\n\n\n    rape has been committed but this question has to be decided\n\n    on the factual matrix of each case, where allegation of rape by\n\n\n\n\n\n    many persons but no injury is noticed, certainly is an\n\n\n\n\n\n    important factor and if the victim version is credible, then no\n\n    corroboration is necessary, but if the victim version is not\n\n    credible, then there would be need for corroboration.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_58\">    33.

The disinclination to inform the family or\n\n    report the matter to the police might be due to apprehension\n\n    and attitude of the society towards the victim. Therefore, the\n\n\n\n    delay in lodging the complaint in such cases does not\n\n\n\n\n    necessarily indicate that her version is false.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_66\">    38.

In our considered opinion, the &#x27;sterling witness&#x27;\n        should be of a very high quality and caliber whose\n        version should, therefore, be unassailable. The Court\n        considering the version of such witness should be in a\n\n\n\n\n                                                         .\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_77\">        position to accept it for its face value without any\n\n\n\n\n\n        hesitation. To test the quality of such a witness, the\n        status of the witness would be immaterial and what\n\n\n\n\n\n        would be relevant is the truthfulness of the statement\n        made by such a witness. What would be more relevant\n        would be the consistency of the statement right from the\n\n\n\n\n                                  of\n        starting point till the end, namely, at the time when the\n        witness makes the initial statement and ultimately\n        before the Court. It should be natural and consistent with\n            rt\n        the case of the prosecution qua the accused. There\n        should not be any prevarication in the version of such a\n\n        witness. The witness should be in a position to withstand\n        the cross- examination of any length and howsoever\n        strenuous it may be and under no circumstance should\n        give room for any doubt as to the factum of the\n\n\n\n        occurrence, the persons involved, as well as, the\n        sequence of it. Such a version should have co-relation\n        with each and everyone of other supporting material\n\n\n\n\n        such as the recoveries made, the weapons used, the\n\n\n\n\n\n        manner of offence committed, the scientific evidence\n        and   the   expert   opinion.   The   said    version      should\n        consistently match with the version of every other\n\n\n\n\n\n        witness. It can even be stated that it should be akin to\n        the test applied in the case of circumstantial evidence\n        where there should not be any missing link in the chain\n        of circumstances to hold the accused guilty of the\n        offence alleged against him. Only if the version of such a\n        witness qualifies the above test as well as all other\n        similar such tests to be applied, it can be held that such\n        a witness can be called as a &#x27;sterling witness&#x27; whose\n        version can be accepted by the Court without any\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\">                                        ::: Downloaded on - 06/09/2023 21:27:38 :::CIS</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_53\">                                   22</span>\n\n\n\n              corroboration and based on which the guilty can be\n              punished.
