At around 9.00 a.m., when the\n\nmembers of the Administration or the Governing Body arrived\n\nat the School premises, the gate of the School was locked and\n\nthe students belonging to 8th, 9th and 11th standard were\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                 -4-</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                          CRL.P No. 1173 of 2022</span>\n\n\n\n\nstanding at the gate shouting slogans against the appointment\n\nof the new Principal. It is alleged that the petitioners requested\n\nthe students to return to their classes but they refused to heed\n\nto their request and then, the petitioners allegedly abused\n\nthem in filthy language and touched them inappropriately. This\n\nbecomes a complaint against the petitioners on 10-01-2015\n\nand a crime in Crime No.20 of 2015 came to be registered for\n\nthe offences punishable under Sections 354, 355, 504, 506 r/w.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">34 of the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_2\">IPC</a> and <a href=\"/doc/188860642/\" id=\"a_3\">Sections 8</a>, <a href=\"/doc/146795221/\" id=\"a_4\">9(f)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/174845796/\" id=\"a_5\">10</a> of the Protection of\n\nChildren from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (for short &#x27;the <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_6\">POCSO\n\nAct</a>&#x27;).\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">         4. In the said proceedings i.e., Special C.C.No.188 of\n\n2017, the petitioners file an application under <a href=\"/doc/1613898/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 207</a> of\n\nthe Cr.P.C. seeking a copy of Pendrive and 2 DVDs&#x27; that were\n\nseized at the time of investigation. This is turned down by the\n\nlearned Sessions Judge by his order dated 01.01.2022.        It is\n\nthis order of the learned Sessions Judge that drives the\n\npetitioners to this Court in the subject petition.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                    -5-</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                              CRL.P No. 1173 of 2022</span>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_5\">      5. The learned counsel for the petitioners submits that\n\nthe petitioners are entitled to all the materials that are part of\n\nthe charge sheet under <a href=\"/doc/1613898/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 207</a> of the Cr.P.C. and they\n\ncannot be denied access to those documents and proceedings\n\nheld, without furnishing of those documents, which would not\n\namount to a fair trial. The documents that they sought for their\n\ndefence, is to establish that they have not committed any such\n\nacts, were the Pen drive in which recordings were made from\n\nCCTV and DVDs.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_6\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"188011203\" id=\"span_5\">6. On the other hand, the learned High Court Government\n\nPleader would refute the submission to contend that the\n\npetitioners are not entitled to the said copy in the light of the\n\njudgment of the Apex Court rendered in the case of the <a href=\"/doc/188011203/\" id=\"a_9\">P.\n\nGOPALKRISHNAN V.

I   have   given   my    anxious    consideration   to   the\n\nsubmissions made by the learned counsel for both the parties\n\nand perused the material on record.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                    -6-</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                                CRL.P No. 1173 of 2022</span>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">     8. The afore-narrated facts are not in dispute. The order\n\nof the learned Sessions Judge declining to grant permission to\n\nfurnish a copy of P.F.Nos.115/2015 and 166/2015, which while\n\nseized, contained Pen drive and two DVDs&#x27;, reads as follows:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">            &quot;7.   .......................         As    per    <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_10\">POCSO     Act</a>   the\n     identity of the victim cannot be disclosed and\n     therefore    the   incident    in    question   and   all   the\n     proceedings    relating   to        <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_11\">POCSO     Act</a>   would   be\n     confidential and cannot be disclosed. Therefore,\n     considering the allegations made in the charge sheet\n     and contents of pen-drive and DVDs as stated in the\n     concerned panchanamas, it can be safely opined that\n     copy of the same cannot be furnished to the accused,\n     in view of legal bar.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">           8. Further even according to <a href=\"/doc/1613898/\" id=\"a_12\">Sec.207</a> Cr.P.C.\n     the accused would be entitled for copy of documents\n     furnished along with charge sheet.              No doubt as\n     argued by learned counsel for accused electronic\n     record including a pendrive and DVD is also a\n     document within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/1580204/\" id=\"a_13\">Sec.29</a> of IPC. But\n     considering the contents of the document and to\n     above legal bar, it is to be held that the accused\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                 -7-</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                          CRL.P No. 1173 of 2022</span>\n\n\n\n\n       cannot be held entitled for copy of said pen-drive and\n       DVSs. Moreover the said panchanamas and pendrive\n       or DVD are not produced along with charge sheet.\n       Therefore the accused has failed to make out that he\n       is entitled for copy of pendrive or 2 DVDs seized\n       under PF No.115/2015 and 166/2015 either in law or\n       on facts.   Hence I answer the above point in the\n       Negative and proceed to pass the following order.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">                                 ORDER&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_9\">              Application filed under <a href=\"/doc/1613898/\" id=\"a_14\">section 207</a> Cr.P.C.\n       seeking to furnish copy of pen-drive and 2 DVDs\n       seized under PF No.115/2015 and 166/2015 is\n       hereby dismissed.&quot;\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\">       The reasons rendered by the learned Sessions Judge\n\nwould fall foul of what the Apex Court has held in the\n\njudgments while interpreting the right of the accused to have\n\nthe documents during a trial.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\">       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"116948997\" id=\"span_10\">9.

This object is rendered\n             entirely meaningless if the police fail to\n             maintain the police diary accurately. Failure\n             to meticulously note down the steps taken\n             during investigation, and the resulting lack\n             of transparency, undermines the accused&#x27;s\n             right to fair investigation; it is up to the\n             trial court that must take an active role in\n             scrutinizing the record extensively, rather\n             than accept the prosecution side willingly,\n             so as to bare such hidden or concealed\n             actions taken during the course of\n             investigation.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">                185.

The liberty of an accused cannot\n    be interfered with except under due\n    process of law. The expression &quot;due\n    process of law&quot; shall deem to include\n    fairness in trial. The court (sic Code)\n    gives a right to the accused to receive all\n    documents and statements as well as to\n    move an application for production of any\n    record or witness in support of his case.\n    This constitutional mandate and\n    statutory rights given to the accused\n    place an implied obligation upon the\n    prosecution (prosecution and the\n    Prosecutor) to make fair disclosure.\n    The concept of fair disclosure would\n    take in its ambit furnishing of a\n    document which the prosecution\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">                  - 14 -\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">                           CRL.P No. 1173 of 2022</span>\n\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">relies upon whether filed in court or\nnot.

The role and obligation of the\nProsecutor particularly in relation to\ndisclosure cannot be equated under our\nlaw to that prevalent under the English\nsystem as aforereferred to.

It may be of different\nconsequences where a document which\nhas     been     obtained     suspiciously,\nfraudulently or by causing undue\nadvantage     to   the   accused during\ninvestigation such document could be\ndenied in the discretion of the Prosecutor\nto the accused whether the prosecution\nrelies or not upon such documents,\nhowever in other cases the obligation to\ndisclose would be more certain. As\nalready noticed the provisions of\nSection 207 have a material bearing\non this subject and make an\ninteresting reading. This provision\nnot only require or mandate that the\ncourt without delay and free of cost\nshould furnish to the accused copies\nof the police report, first information\nreport,     statements,      confessional\nstatements of the persons recorded\nunder     Section    161     whom      the\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">                - 15 -\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">                         CRL.P No. 1173 of 2022</span>\n\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">prosecution wishes to examine as\nwitnesses, of course, excluding any\npart of a statement or document as\ncontemplated under Section 173(6)\nof the Code, any other document or\nrelevant extract thereof which has\nbeen submitted to the Magistrate by\nthe police under sub-section (5) of\nSection 173.

As far as the present case is\n    concerned, we have already noticed that\n    no prejudice had been caused to the\n    right of the accused to fair trial and non-\n    furnishing of the copy of one of the\n    ballistic reports had not hampered the\n    ends of justice. Some shadow of doubt\n    upon veracity of the document had also\n    been created by the prosecution and the\n    prosecution opted not to rely upon this\n    document. In these circumstances, the\n    right of the accused to disclosure has not\n    received any setback in the facts and\n    circumstances of the case.

It is crystal clear that all documents\nincluding &quot;electronic record&quot; produced for the\ninspection of the court along with the police report and\nwhich prosecution proposes to use against the accused\nmust be furnished to the accused as per the mandate\nof Section 207 of the 1973 Code. The concomitant is\nthat the contents of the memory card/pen-drive must\nbe furnished to the accused, which can be done in the\nform of cloned copy of the memory card/pen-drive. It\nis cardinal that a person tried for such a serious\noffence should be furnished with all the material and\nevidence in advance, on which the prosecution\nproposes to rely against him during the trial. Any other\nview would not only impinge upon the statutory\nmandate contained in the 1973 Code, but also the\nright of an accused to a fair trial enshrined in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_30\">Article\n21</a> of the Constitution of India.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_29\">      39. We do not wish to dilate further nor should\nwe be understood to have examined the question of\nrelevancy of the contents of the memory card/pen-\ndrive or for that matter the proof and admissibility\nthereof. The only question that we have examined in\nthis appeal is : whether the contents of the memory\ncard/pen-drive referred to in the charge-sheet or the\npolice report submitted to Magistrate under Section\n173 of the 1973 Code, need to be furnished to the\naccused if the prosecution intends to rely on the same\nby virtue of Section 207 of the 1973 Code?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_30\">     40.

Even the objection regarding\nincorrect factual narration about the appellant having\nhimself viewed the contents of the memory card/pen-\ndrive does not take the matter any further, once we\nrecognise the right of the accused to get the cloned\ncopies of the contents of the memory card/pen-drive\nas being mandated by Section 207 of the 1973 Code\nand more so, because of the right of the accused to a\nfair trial enshrined in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_31\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of\nIndia.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_33\">       41. The next crucial question is : whether\nparting of the cloned copy of the contents of the\nmemory card/pen-drive and handing it over to the\naccused may be safe or is likely to be misused by the\naccused or any other person with or without the\npermission of the accused concerned? In the present\ncase, there are eight named accused as of now. Once\nrelief is granted to the appellant who is Accused 8, the\nother accused would follow the same suit.

In that, the appellant can formulate queries\nwith the help of an expert of his choice, for being\nposed to the stated agency. That shall be confidential\nand not allowed to be accessed by any other agency or\nperson not associated with CFSL. Similarly, the\nforensic report prepared by CFSL, after analysing the\ncloned copy of the subject memory card/pen-drive,\nshall be kept confidential and shall not be allowed to\nbe accessed by any other agency or person except the\naccused or his authorised representative concerned\nuntil the conclusion of the trial. We are inclined to say\nso because the State FSL has already submitted its\nforensic report in relation to the same memory card at\nthe instance of the investigating agency.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_38\">                          - 23 -\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">                                    CRL.P No. 1173 of 2022</span>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_39\">       44. Needless to mention that the appellant\nbefore us or the other accused cannot and are not\nclaiming any expertise, much less, capability of\nundertaking forensic analysis of the cloned copy of the\ncontents of the memory card/pen-drive. They may\nhave to eventually depend on some expert agency. In\nour opinion, the accused, who are interested in\nreassuring themselves about the genuineness and\ncredibility of the contents of the memory card in\nquestion or that of the pen-drive produced before the\ntrial court by the prosecution on which the prosecution\nwould rely during the trial, are free to take opinion of\nan independent expert agency, such as the CFSL on\nsuch matters as they may be advised, which\ninformation can be used by them to confront the\nprosecution witnesses including the forensic report of\nthe State FSL relied upon by the prosecution forming\npart of the police report.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_40\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"126728071\" id=\"span_33\">45.

Thus, there can be two individuals both\nhaving legitimacy to claim or assert the right.\nThe factum of legitimacy is a primary\nconsideration. It has to be remembered that\nno fundamental right is absolute and it can\nhave limitations in certain circumstances. ...\nTherefore, if the collective interest or the\npublic interest that serves the public cause\nand further has the legitimacy to claim or\nassert a fundamental right, then only it can\nput forth that their right should be protected.\nThere can be no denial of the fact that the\nrights of the victims for a fair trial is an\ninseparable aspect of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_37\">Article 21</a> of the\nConstitution and when they assert that right\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_46\">                      - 25 -\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">                                    CRL.P No. 1173 of 2022</span>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_47\">by themselves as well as the part of the\ncollective, the conception of public interest\ngets galvanised.
