The present Public Interest Litigation has been brought about by the\n\npetitioners who are supposed to belong to primitive tribal groups and are\n\nofficially labelled as Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTG).                                   They\n\nhave a grievance that based on an archaic Office Order dated 13.12.1979\n\nissued by the erstwhile state of Madhya Pradesh, specially the department\n\nof Public Health and Family Welfare, the tribes or sub-tribes whose names\n\nhave been indicated and who inhabit the geographical areas indicated\n\ntherein are barred from availing the facility of undergoing family planning\n\nprocedure by Tubectomy or vasectomy etc.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_4\">2.

This Circular permits sterilization but for which prior\n\npermission of the Sub-Divisional Magistrate is required to be taken. Even\n\nthe said circular or guideline dated 26.05.2017 is being assailed because the\n\nmodified circular also in no manner takes away the vulnerability of such\n\ndecision on the touch-stone of the <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_2\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_7\">4.

The study showed very high levels of\nmalnutrition among Baiga children under five years of age.\nUnderweight and stunting among these children was 1.5 times\nmore than the state average. The proportion of undernourished\nBaiga women and men was double that of Chhattisgarh state\naverage while illness was nearly six times more than that of rural\nChhattisgarh average with more women than men reported ill\nhealth.    According to study, malaria and diarrhoea were major\ndiseases affecting the community. The death rate among Baigas\nwas much higher and the community had to rely mostly on\nunqualified private practitioners and they also took treatment from\nMitanins and ANMs.            There were some hamlets who were\ncompletely devoid of Anganwadi services due to distances and\n                                                           wppil 27 of 2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                              5</span>\n\n\nthere were no mini anganwadis. Safe drinking water was a huge\nproblem that let to many health issues. The status of maternal and\nreproductive health was very dire and the restriction on sterilisation\nhad very negative impact on health of women and children and\neconomic status of family. Large number of pregnancies and child\ndeaths were reported. Both Baiga women and men said they did\nnot want large families and demanded contraceptive services like\nsterilisation. Women were forced to go to Madhya Pradesh to get\nsterilisation. The ANM reported shortage of other contraceptives\nlike Mala-D and condoms.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_11\">5.4    That Jan Swasthaya Sahyog, the organization, petitioner\nno.11 works with, and the organization that the petitioners\napproached wanting to avail sterilisation service conducted a study\nin 2017 on access to sterilisation and contraceptive services to\nPVTGs. The study was conducted in two villages, Sarasdol and\nChapparwa of Mungeli district, which are situated deep inside the\nAchanakmar Tiger Reserve.           One of the key findings was that\n56.4% of the Baiga women reported that they wanted to undergo\nsterilisation out of which 48.2% got the operation done and 51.7%\ncould not get the procedure done primarily because of their PVTG\nstatus. The study further found that unavailability of sterilisation\nand contraception services made women often opt for induced\nabortion.    Among those who had induced abortions, most were\npractised using unsafe methods which include self-medication to\nterminate pregnancy, massaging the stomach or consuming\njadi-buti to induce the abortion.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1500783\" id=\"span_4\">Reproductive Rights as Part of Right to Life &amp; Liberty\n5.5    It is submitted that the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/1500783/\" id=\"a_4\">Suchita\nSrivastava &amp; Anr V.

The crucial\n    consideration is that a woman&#x27;s right to privacy, dignity and\n    bodily integrity should be respected. This means that there\n    should be no restriction whatsoever on the exercise of\n    reproductive choices such as a woman&#x27;s right to refuse\n    participation in sexual activity or alternatively the insistence on\n    use of contraceptive methods.
