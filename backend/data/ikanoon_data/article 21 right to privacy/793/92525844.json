Despite the defendants have produced the ExD3 to ExD5 are\n\n                    the publications published in other magazines, the contents therein are\n\n                    different and not similar to the subject contents raised in the suit. while\n\n                    being so, the defendants cannot question the plaintiff why the defamation\n\n                    suit or criminal proceedings are not made against the magazine mentioned\n\n                    in Ex.D3 to Ex.D5. It is the right of the plaintiff on whom he has to sue the\n\n                    suit. The defendant cannot question the right of the plaintiff in this regard.\n\n                    Hence, the entire article published by the Defendants that the Plaintiff\n\n                    made a speech and called Rahul Gandhi a small boy (“uhFy;\n\n                    rpd;dg;igad;”) are made without proper verification or confirming the\n\n                    veracity of the news and published the same with a calculated intention of\n\n                    defaming the Plaintiff, calling a top leader of the Congress party who was\n\n                    the prime ministerial candidate of the UPA in 2014 as &#x27;Small boy&#x27; is\n\n                    certainly offensive and attributing such words to the Plaintiff is purely out\n\n                    of ill will with an intention to defame the Plaintiff by tarnishing his image\n\n                    and reputation in the minds in the political leaders and the general public.\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_67\">                   31/37</span>\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_68\">\f                                                                                      C.S.No.252 of 2014</span>\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_42\">                                    19. Having considered the facts and circumstances of the case\n\n                    and reliance of the various Judgments cited by the learned counsel for the\n\n                    plaintiff, it is proved that the news items appeared in bi-weekly Tamil\n\n                    magazine &#x27;Junior Vikatan&#x27; on 22.12.2013, are malicious and defamatory\n\n                    thereby lowered the character and reputation of the plaintiff. Accordingly,\n\n                    issue nos.2 and 3 are answered. Hence, the plaintiff is entitled for damages\n\n                    on account of his lowering of image among the public as well as his family.\n\n                    Accordingly, issue No.4 is answered.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_43\">                                  20. It is seen from the evidence of DW1 that he has filed the\n\n                    proof affidavit without discussing or confirming the same with the\n\n                    defendants. Further, he has deposed that he was working as Senior\n\n                    Journalist in the Junior Vikatan during the publication of the subject\n\n                    contents and he has not produced any document to prove that he was one of\n\n                    the authority and approval person to publish the subject contents. To prove\n\n                    the news in issue dated 22.12.2013, the defendants have not produced a\n\n                    single document on the basis of which the said issues were published in\n\n                    their magazine.

Being\n\n                    the renowned magazine among the people having wide circulation, they\n\n                    should take much more cautious before publishing the news and they\n\n                    cannot take the privilege to tarnish the image and reputation of the Plaintiff\n\n                    amongst the minds of the public while the plaintiff held in various posts.\n\n                    Hence, the plaintiff is entitled to the compensation of Rs.25,00,000/- for\n\n                    causing the damages to the reputation of the plaintiff by the defendants.\n\n                    However, the plaintiff cannot seek for permanent injunction for the future\n\n                    publications regarding the subject matter in the present suit.
