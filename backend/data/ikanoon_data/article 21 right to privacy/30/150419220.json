The facts as averred in the affidavit filed in support of the\n\nwrit petition disclose that the petitioner claims to be the\n\npermanent resident of Kushaiguda, Kapra village and running\n\ncloth shop near Kushaiguda Bus Stop. Mr. Kasula Nandam is the\n\nprotected tenant and in possession of land to an extent Acs.6.32\n\nguntas in Sy.No.170 of Kapra village, having obtained occupancy\n\nrights certificate in the year 1979.       Said Kasuma Nandam\n\nappointed the petitioner as General Power of Attorney holder to\n\nlook after the said property. According to the petitioner, there are\n\nseveral bogus claimants over the said land based on fabricated\n\ndocuments. Earlier rival claim was made by M/s. Bhavana Rishi\n\nWelfare Association.    They instituted O.S.No.1013/2002 in the\n\nCourt of III Additional Senior Civil Judge (FTC), Ranga Reddy. The\n\nsuit was dismissed by judgment and decree dated 15.12.2010\n\nupholding the claim of petitioner&#x27;s principal.   A.S.No.194 of 2011\n\nfiled by the said association is pending consideration of this Court.\n\nPetitioner alleges that person, who is making false claim on the\n\nabove extent of land, lodged several complaints against him over a\n\nperiod of time. In all the complaints, which are registered against\n\nthe petitioner and facing prosecution, pertain to very same land.\n\nOn the ground of registration of crimes, and pending trial before\n\nthe criminal Courts, rowdy sheet is opened and in the guise of\n\nopening of rowdy sheet, respondent-Police are keeping close\n                                                                            PNR,J\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                                              WP No.18364 of 2020</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                      3</span>\n\n\nsurveillance on the movements of the petitioner, affecting his right,\n\nliberty and privacy.         Petitioner assails the said decision of the\n\nrespondent-Police in opening the rowdy sheet.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_4\">3.        According to the learned counsel for petitioner, all the crimes\n\nregistered against the petitioner pertain to the land disputes and\n\nthey are all false claims generated by rival claimants to knock away\n\nthe property. The rowdy sheet is opened at the instance of rival\n\nclaimants only to harass and humiliate him. There is no\n\napplication of mind by the Police before opening the rowdy sheet\n\nand their action in opening rowdy sheet amounts to abuse of\n\nprocess of law.         Merely because certain crimes are registered,\n\nwhich mostly relate to the allegation of criminal trespass by the\n\nrival claimants, petitioner cannot be classified as habitual offender\n\nnecessitating opening of rowdy sheet. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1750127\" id=\"span_3\">In support of his contention,\n\nlearned counsel for petitioner placed reliance on the decision of the\n\nDivision        Bench   of   this   Court   in   <a href=\"/doc/1750127/\" id=\"a_1\">Puttagunta      Pasi       vs.\n\nCommissioner of Police</a> and others1.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_5\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_6\">4.        From the averments in the counter-affidavit filed by the 2nd\n\nrespondent, it is seen that so far seven crimes are registered\n\nagainst the petitioner since the year 2017.         Out of this, in five\n\ncrimes, he is facing trial and two crimes are pending at the stage of\n\ncollection of evidence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_7\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">5.        In view of the registration of said crimes, on 07.10.2020\n\nrowdy sheet was opened in Kushaiguda Police Station. According\n\nto the respondent-Police, there is ample evidence adduced during\n\nthe course of investigation alleging that petitioner is grabbing\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">1</span>\n    1998 (3) ALT 55\n                                                                      PNR,J\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                                        WP No.18364 of 2020</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                   4</span>\n\n\nprivate and Government lands by way of illegal means, that due to\n\nfear of the petitioner, no one is coming forward to lodge fresh\n\ncomplaint. Thus, in view of the public interest and to safeguard\n\nthe residents of the area, where petitioner is residing, and to curb\n\nhis unlawful activities, rowdy sheet is opened. In support of their\n\ndecision to open rowdy sheet reliance is placed on Police Standing\n\nOrder 601.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_9\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_10\">6.    Supporting the averments in the counter-affidavit and the\n\ndecision to open rowdy sheet, learned Assistant Government\n\nPleader submitted that unless a close monitoring is undertaken\n\nagainst the petitioner, there is every possibility of committing more\n\ncrimes. He would submit that the crimes registered under various\n\nprovisions of <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_2\">IPC</a> reflect criminal mind of petitioner. Even though\n\ncrimes relate to landed property, the nature of crimes registered\n\nagainst the petitioner and that he is facing trial would show that\n\npetitioner is in the habit of committing offences, causing\n\ndisturbance to the public and security of the public.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\">7.    The issue for consideration is whether the Police are justified\n\nin opening the rowdy sheet against the petitioner ?\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_12\">8.    Enforcement of law and order is most important State\n\nfunction.    To enforce law and order State formed Police Force.\n\nEnforcement of law and order includes taking all preventive\n\nmeasures to ensure that no untoward incident happens and peace\n\nand tranquility is not affected.   To prevent breach of peace and\n\ntranquility, it is permissible for the police to take all measures\n\npossible.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">                                                                        PNR,J\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                                          WP No.18364 of 2020</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                  5</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">9.    There are several persons who are known to be frequently\n\ninvolving in crimes. Such involvement can be on various aspects.\n\nBecause of frequent involvement in crimes, they pose threat to life,\n\nliberty and freedom of others and a greater challenge on police to\n\ncontrol such persons. In order to prevent such person indulging in\n\ncrimes, police may resort to keep a watch on him; in other words,\n\nto keep surveillance on him; to closely monitor his day today\n\nactivities and his movements.     No statutory provision prescribes\n\nsuch surveillance. Police Standing Orders are notified in exercise\n\nof executive power which deal with various aspects of functioning\n\nof the Police Officer. These standing orders also deal with keeping\n\nsurveillance on known criminals. For the purpose of keeping\n\nsurveillance, Police Standing Order 601 enables opening a Rowdy\n\nSheet in the concerned police station. After opening of rowdy sheet,\n\nclose surveillance is enforced on the concerned person.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_15\">10.   Opening    of   Rowdy   Sheet   and    thereon   keeping       close\n\nsurveillance on the person would certainly infringe upon right to\n\nlife, liberty and privacy of the individual concerned. Right to life,\n\nliberty and privacy flows out of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_3\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of\n\nIndia. Right to life and liberty are sacrosanct to any person.\n\nA person is entitled to lead his life with dignity and self respect and\n\ndoes not want an outsider to intrude in his private affairs and to\n\nprobe into his movements. Thus, there are two competing interests\n\non preventive measures. On the one side is right guaranteed by\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_4\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India, which is sacrosanct and on\n\nthe other side is the primacy of enforcement of law and order,\n\nmaintenance of peace and tranquility, which is the primary\n                                                                                                PNR,J\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                                                                  WP No.18364 of 2020</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                                   6</span>\n\n\nresponsibility of the State through its police force.                              Compelling\n\npublic interest may require intrusion into privacy of a person.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_16\">11.           Having regard to the mandate of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_5\">Article 21</a> of the\n\nConstitution of India, when a rowdy sheet is opened, it is the\n\nbounden duty of the police to take due care and caution and resort\n\nto       opening        of   rowdy       sheet     can     be    only     in    extraordinary\n\ncircumstances where such recourse is imminent to enforce peace\n\nand tranquility in the locality and to prevent happening of\n\nuntoward incident. When a citizen comes to the High Court\n\nalleging infringement of his right to life, liberty and privacy by\n\nopening a rowdy sheet, the Court can look into whether the\n\ndecision of the police to have a surveillance on the petitioner is\n\njustified and supported by the material on record or it was initiated\n\nonly to harass and humiliate the individual. It is to be noted that\n\nmere involvement in a crime may not per se require surveillance on\n\nthat person.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\">12.           <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1470089\" id=\"span_11\">In <a href=\"/doc/1470089/\" id=\"a_6\">Mohammed Quadeer and others Vs.

Opening of a rowdy sheet against a citizen is undoubtedly fraught with\n           serious consequences. <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_7\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India guarantees\n           right to life with dignity and the right to live, as a dignified man, carries with\n           it the right to reputation. Right to reputation is an integral part of right to\n           life guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_8\">Article 21</a>, and such a right cannot be deprived except in\n           accordance with the procedure established by law. Such laws which\n           authorise the Police to open rowdy sheets and exercise surveillance are\n           required to be very strictly construed. Opening of the rowdy sheets and\n           retention thereof except in accordance with law would amount to\n           infringement of fundamental right guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_9\">Article 21</a> of the\n           Constitution of India. It is true that the State is duty bound at all levels to\n           protect the persons and property from the criminals and criminal activity.\n           Prevention of organised crime is an obligation on the part of the State.\n</blockquote>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">2</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">    1999 (3) ALD 60\n                                                                                              PNR,J\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                                                                                WP No.18364 of 2020</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                                               7</span>\n\n\n\n        Right to Privacy:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">        32. Fundamental rights and civil liberties exist and can only flourish in an\n        orderly society. Civil liberties and fundamental rights are intimately\n        connected with the nature and dynamics of the Society. It is the duty of the\n        Police to deal with crime and criminals expeditiously and effectively while at\n        the same time holding to the values and concepts of the fundamental rights\n        and the Constitution. Both the competing interests are to be reconciled. This\n        much is clear so far as our Constitutional system is concerned that\n        intrusion into personal liberty without an authority of law is forbidden.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_19\">        Surveillance and watching of movements of a citizen by the Police is not a\n        matter of course. Such rights can be exercised by the Police only in\n        accordance with law which permits such surveillance. The action in this\n        regard which is in accordance with law may result in violation of the\n        fundamental rights guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_10\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India.\n        Every citizen has fundamental right and entitled to indulge in harmless\n        activities without observation or interference. It is a right to be left alone.\n        The guarantee in <a href=\"/doc/691208/\" id=\"a_11\">Article 8</a> of the European Convention of Human Rights that\n        &quot;Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home\n        and has correspondence&quot; reflects both the individual&#x27;s psychological need to\n        preserve an intrusion-free zone of personality and family, and the anguish\n        and stress which can be suffered when that zone is violated. The saying that\n        &#x27;an Englishman&#x27;s home is his castle&#x27; would be equally applicable to Indian\n        situation and it can be said that an &#x27;Indian citizen&#x27;s home is his castle.&#x27;\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"232602\" id=\"span_15\">13.

Surveillance by the police makes very serious inroads into the life of a\n        person. It even grossly violates the right of persons to privacy. Obtrusive\n        surveillance does not leave a citizen alone. With the subtle methods of\n        telephone tapping, telescope watching, remote controlled audio and video\n        recording gadgets, a citizen subjected to surveillance can never have mental\n        peace and thus his life and liberty at every movement would be restricted. A\n        person with lot of restrictions cannot be expected to lead a dignified life and\n        exercise his right to liberty and other freedoms. A citizen&#x27;s life would become\n        miserable.

Therefore, in the context of police surveillance against history sheeters\n        and rowdy sheeters, the following principles vis-a-vis right to privacy under\n        <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_13\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution would emerge: (i) If the surveillance is not\n        obtrusive, the same does not violate the right to privacy under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_14\">Article 21</a> of\n        the Constitution of India. The same does not either in material or palpable\n        form affect the right of the suspect to move freely nor can it be held to\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">3</span>\n    1999 (6) ALT 249\n                                                                                             PNR,J\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                                                                               WP No.18364 of 2020</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                                               8</span>\n\n\n       deprive the history sheeter / rowdy sheeter of his personal liberty. (ii) In\n       testing whether fundamental right of free movement or personal liberty is\n       infringed or not, it is to be remembered that infringement should be direct as\n       well as tangible. If surveillance hurts personal sensitivities, the same is not a\n       violation, for the constitution makers never intended to protect mere\n       personal sensitiveness. (iii) If police surveillance is in accordance with\n       executive/departmental guidelines and not authorised by statute or rules\n       having statutory force, it is for the State to prove that surveillance does not\n       in anyway infringe the fundamental right of the person and that the\n       authorities   have   followed   the   guidelines   scrupulously    in    ordering\n       surveillance, (iv) If the action of the police is found to infringe the freedoms\n       guaranteed to the history sheeter / rowdy sheeter and violates his right to\n       privacy, in that, the surveillance is excessively obtrusive and intrusive, it\n       may seriously encroach on the privacy of a citizen as to infringe the\n       fundamental right to privacy and personal liberty under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_15\">Article 21</a> as well as\n       the freedom of movement guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1024002/\" id=\"a_16\">Article 19(1)(d)</a> of the\n       Constitution of India and the same is impermissible, (v) Even where there is\n       statutory sanction for surveillance against history sheeter/rowdy sheeter\n       principle (iv) is equally applicable, if the surveillance is obtrusive. (vi) In\n       either case-whether police regulations are statutory or where they have no\n       statutory force-there should be sufficient material to induce the opinion that\n       the history sheeters/rowdy sheeters show a determination to lead a life of\n       crime which involves public peace or security only. Mere convictions in\n       criminal cases where nothing imperils the safety of the society cannot be\n       regarded as warrange surveillance under the relevant regulations, however\n       broadly and in whatever language the regulation might have been couched,\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">       (vii) In either case-whether the regulation is statutory or non-statutory-\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\">       domiciliary visits and picketing by the police should be reduced to the\n       clearest cases of danger to community security, and there can be no routine\n       follow-up at the end of a conviction or release from prison in every case.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\">       (viii) The above principles that emerge from various binding precedents\n       are only general principles. As seen from various decided cases of this\n       Court, opening of history sheet or rowdy sheet can be justified only\n       when it is proved before the Court by the State that based on the\n       relevant material the competent police officer has applied mind with\n       due care and considered all aspects in the light of the law and then\n       ordered   opening     of   history    sheet   or   rowdy   sheet   or    ordered\n       continuation or retention of the history sheet. In the beginning of this\n       Judgment, all the relevant decisions of this Court have been referred to\n       and those principles may also have to be kept in mind.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_23\">                                                                  (emphasis supplied)\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">14.      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"890637\" id=\"span_19\">In the light of the facts, noted above, it is appropriate to note\n\nthe observations of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/890637/\" id=\"a_17\">Vijay Narain\n\nSingh v. State of Bihar4</a>. It was a case of preventive detention,\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">4</span>\n    AIR 1984 SC 1334\n                                                                                          PNR,J\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">                                                                            WP No.18364 of 2020</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">                                               9</span>\n\n\nbut the Court considered what constitutes &#x27;habitual offender&#x27; and\n\nthe role of the Court vis-a-viz the responsibility of the police for\n\nmaintenance of public order. It is useful to extract paragraph\n\nNo.15 of <a href=\"/doc/890637/\" id=\"a_18\">the said judgment</a>. It reads as under:</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_25\">      &quot;15.      It is not difficult to conceive of a person who by himself or as a\n      member or leader of a gang habitually commits or attempts to commit or\n      abets the commission of offences punishable under Chapter XVI or Chapter\n      XVII of the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_19\">Indian Penal Code</a>. It however does not follow that because of the\n      word &#x27;habitually&#x27; in sub-cl. (i), sub-cl. (ii) or sub-cl. (iv), there should be a\n      repetition of same class of acts or omissions referred to in sub-cl. (i), sub-cl.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_26\">      (ii) or in sub-cl. (iv) by the person concerned before he can be treated to be\n      an anti-social element and detained by the District Magistrate under Section\n      12 (2) of the Act. In my view, it is not required that the nature or character of\n      the anti-social acts should be the same or similar. There maybe commission\n      or attempt to commit or abetment of diverse nature of acts constituting\n      offences under Chapter XVI or Chapter XVII of the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_20\">Indian Penal Code</a>.

Having regard to the principles governing opening of Rowdy\n\nSheet vis-à-vis right to life and liberty, it is necessary to considered\n\nwhether by opening rowdy sheet against petitioner, respondent\n\npolice have violated the mandate of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_21\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of\n\nIndia and whether their decision is supported by reasons\n\nwarranting requirement to open rowdy sheet.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_28\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_29\">16.

Police Standing Order 601-A has wide amplitude and\n\nencompasses various aspects of crime.                      Having regard to the\n\ncrimes registered against the petitioner and that he is facing trial\n\nin five cases, it cannot be said that action of the Police in opening\n\nrowdy sheet amounts to abuse or misuse of power and authority,\n\nand cannot be said as one made in illegal exercise of power and\n\nwithout application of mind. It is permissible to the Police to open\n\na rowdy sheet if Police are of the view that petitioner is habitually\n\ncommitting offences/abutting commission of offence involving\n                                                                          PNR,J\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">                                                            WP No.18364 of 2020</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">                                   11</span>\n\n\nbreach of peace, disturbance to the public order and security.\n\nThus, there is no merit in the writ petition and is accordingly\n\ndismissed.   However,    it   is   made   clear    that   while   keeping\n\nsurveillance, Police shall ensure that it is minimal, not obtrusive\n\nand not to impinge upon his privacy.
