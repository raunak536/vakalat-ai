The factual score that has been depicted in the instant\n\nappeal is reflective of a retardant attitude and laxness to\n\nthe application of the provisions of law at the appropriate\n\ntime by the authorities that can cause a disastrous affect\n\non the mind of a hapless victim. And the victim here is a\n\ndestitute woman, who was brought to a shelter home\n\nfrom the footpath, as she was not wanted by her\n\nhusband and her family, living in abject poverty and\n\nbeing scared of social stigma could not afford her a home.\n\nSans a sense of belonging, she was brought to ‘Shanti\n\nKutir’, a shelter home, run by an organization named\n\nYouth Mobilization for National Advancement (YMNA)\n\nunder the Mukhyamantri Bhikshavriti Nivaran Yojna a\n\nscheme floated by the Government of Bihar for destitute\n\nwomen. The woman, a destitute, was found to be\n\npregnant by the functionaries of the home and further\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">\f                                                             3</span>\n\nbeing aware of the fact that she had been condemned to\n\nthat condition because of rape committed on her, the\n\ncompetent authority of the home took her to the hospital\n\nfor termination of pregnancy with her consent. Though\n\nthe steps taken by the shelter home were prompt, yet\n\ndelay was caused by the authorities of the hospital. The\n\ndelay in such a situation has the seed that can cause\n\ndepression to a woman, who is already in despair. And\n\nthis despair has the potentiality to drive one on the path\n\nof complete distress. In such a situation, the victim in a\n\nstate of anguish may even think of surrendering to death\n\nor live with a traumatic experience which can be\n\ncompared to have a life that has been fragmented at the\n\ncellular level. It is because the duty cast on the\n\nauthorities under the <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_1\">Medical Termination of Pregnancy\n\nAct, 1971</a> (for brevity, ‘the Act’) is not dutifully performed,\n\nand the failure has ultimately given rise to a catastrophe;\n\na prolonged torment. That is the sad narrative of the\n\nvictim appellant.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">3.   The appellant, a thirty-five year old woman, was\n\nliving on the footpath in Phulwarisharif, Patna.          On\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">\f                                                        4</span>\n\n25th January, 2017, she was brought to Shanti Kutir. The\n\nmedical test done by Shanti Kutir showed that she was\n\npregnant. On 2nd February, 2017, she was taken to Patna\n\nMedical College Hospital, Patna (PMCH), for medical\n\nexamination. On 8th February, 2017, an ultrasound test\n\nwas done at PMCH, and it was found that she was 13\n\nweeks and 6 days pregnant.     On 4th March, 2017, she\n\nexpressed her desire to terminate the pregnancy and,\n\naccordingly, she was taken to PMCH for further medical\n\nexamination.   At that juncture, the appellant revealed\n\nthat she had been raped and, therefore, the pregnancy\n\nshould be terminated.   On 14 th March, 2017, she was\n\ntaken to PMCH for termination and her father and\n\nbrother were called and made to sign a consent form,\n\nwhich they duly signed. However, the hospital authorities\n\ndid not proceed with the termination of the pregnancy. It\n\nis worthy to mention here that on 18 th March, 2017, an\n\nF.I.R. under <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 376</a> of the Indian Penal Code (<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_3\">IPC</a>)\n\nwas registered with Mahila Police Station, Patna as Case\n\nNo.13 of 2017. The Home Superintendent, Shanti Kutir\n\nwrote to the Superintendent of Patna Medical College and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">\f                                                            5</span>\n\nHospital, Patna, stating, inter alia, that the pregnancy is\n\nmore than 17 weeks and a divorce petition had been filed\n\nby the husband, and the father and the brother of the\n\nappellant expressed their inability to take her with them\n\nbecause of social and financial constraints.   On 3 rd April,\n\n2017, she was again taken to PMCH, but the termination\n\nwas not carried out and, by that time, her pregnancy was\n\n20 weeks old. As the factual narration would reveal, the\n\nappellant was found to be HIV+ve.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">4.   As the pregnancy was not carried out, the appellant\n\napproached the High Court in C.W.J.C. No. 5286 of 2017\n\nwith the prayer to ascertain the physical condition\n\nincluding the stage of pregnancy and to direct for\n\ntermination of pregnancy as she had been sexually\n\nassaulted and further she was HIV+ve. The High Court,\n\non 10th April, 2017, permitted the counsel for the victim\n\nto implead the husband and her father and the Director\n\nof Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences, Patna\n\n(IGIMS). Thereafter, the learned single Judge directed for\n\nconstitution of a Medical Board at IGIMS, Patna, to\n\nassess the physical and mental condition of the writ\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">\f                                                           6</span>\n\npetitioner therein and the fetus. On that day, the High\n\nCourt also directed the Home Superintendent, Shanti\n\nKutir, a Women Rehabilitation Centre, to file a counter\n\naffidavit.   Similar direction was issued to the State of\n\nBihar and Superintendent of PMCH. A further direction\n\nwas      given   by   the   High   Court   to   the   Senior\n\nSuperintendent of Police, Patna, to submit an interim\n\nreport with regard to the progress of investigation in\n\nMahila P.S. Case No.13 of 2017.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">5.    It is apt to note here that the Director, IGIMS, Patna\n\nwas directed to constitute a Multi Disciplinary Medical\n\nBoard consisting of Heads of Department of Gynecology,\n\nNeurology and Forensic Medicine. Liberty was granted to\n\nthe Director, IGIMS to nominate one or more doctors as\n\nmembers of the Multi Disciplinary Medical Board to\n\nexamine the victim with regard to physical and mental\n\nstate and the condition of the fetus. The writ petitioner\n\nwas directed to make herself present before the Director,\n\nIGIMS, on 11th April, 2017 at 10.30 a.m.         The IGIMS\n\nexamined the victim and submitted a report in a sealed\n\ncover.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">\f                                                            7</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_9\">6.   As the factual matrix would further uncurtain, on\n\n18th April, 2017, the High Court took note of the fact that\n\nthe name of the appellant’s husband had been wrongly\n\nmentioned and a direction was issued to make dasti\n\nservice on the husband and the father through the\n\nOfficer In-charge of the local police station and the\n\nmatter was fixed for 20th April, 2017.      On 20th April,\n\n2017, the matter could not be taken up and stood\n\nadjourned to 21st April, 2017.    On the adjourned date,\n\nthe father of the appellant prayed for time to file counter\n\naffidavit. The High Court expressed its displeasure that\n\ndespite the specific direction, the Senior Superintendent\n\nof Police, Patna, had not filed any counter affidavit,\n\nalthough a submission was made by the learned\n\nAdditional Advocate General that he had been intimated\n\nby   the   Senior   Superintendent   of   Police   that   the\n\ninvestigation was in progress and likely to be over within\n\nsix months.    Thereafter, the High Court proceeded to\n\ndetermine the issue whether the victim, who is HIV+ve\n\nand is carrying a pregnancy of 24 weeks could be allowed\n\nto have medical termination of pregnancy under the Act.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">\f                                                           8</span>\n\nThe stand of the Government before the High Court was\n\nthat the victim was being provided with all facilities to\n\nsurvive in rehabilitation centre and the pregnancy could\n\nnot be terminated because the identity of the father of\n\nthe victim was not established and he had refused to\n\nswear an affidavit in this regard and subsequently\n\nescaped from the scene. The stand of the father of the\n\nvictim before the High Court was that he did not have\n\nany objection for getting the pregnancy terminated. The\n\nhusband, the respondent No. 8 before the High Court,\n\nadmitted that he had entered into wedlock with the\n\nvictim and in the said wedlock two children were born,\n\nbut the victim had deserted him in March, 2007, and the\n\nsaid circumstances led him to file Matrimonial Suit No.\n\n984 of 2015 before the Principal Judge, Family Court,\n\nPatna, seeking dissolution of marriage.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_10\">7.   The High Court perused the report submitted by\n\nIGIMS, which suggested that the pregnancy was 20 to 24\n\nweeks old and the termination of pregnancy would\n\nrequire   major   surgical   procedure    along   with   the\n\nsubsequent consequences such as bleeding, sepsis and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">\f                                                                     9</span>\n\nanesthesia hazards.

The    High   Court   decided    the   matter    on\n\n26th April, 2017.   When the said order was challenged,\n\nthe present appeal was taken up on 3 rd May, 2017. The\n\nlearned counsel for the appellant referred to the facts as\n\nasserted in the special leave petition which is evincible\n\nfrom the order of the High Court. Though the Union of\n\nIndia is not a party, Mr. P.S.

Learned counsel for the appellant, after\n\nobtaining instructions, stated that she is inclined to be\n\nexamined by the Medical Board at AIIMS. Taking note of\n\nthe same, the Court directed as follows:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">      “Mr. P.S.

As we are inclined to think that a\n      woman, who has already become a destitute\n      being sexually assaulted and suffering from a\n      serious medical ailment, not to go through\n      further sufferings.

In pursuance of the order passed by this Court, the\n\nMedical Board at AIIMS examined the appellant.              The\n\nopinion of the Medical Board was that the procedure\n\ninvolved in termination of the pregnancy is risky to the\n\nlife of the appellant and the fetus in the womb. It has\n\nsuggested that she should be advised to continue HAART\n\ntherapy and routine antenatal care to reduce the risk of\n\nHIV transmission to the fetus. In view of the said report,\n\nthe Court on 9th May, 2017, directed as follows:\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">\f                                                      17</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">“In view of the aforesaid opinion, it is the\naccepted position at the Bar that there cannot\nbe termination of pregnancy.

The one facet of\n      granting compensation pertains to negligence\n      and delay which come within the domain of\n      public law remedy. The other aspect of the\n      compensation comes under the scheme dated\n      24.3.2014 framed under <a href=\"/doc/158101963/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 357-A</a> of the\n      Code of Criminal Procedure. Needless to say,\n      the petitioner is eligible to get the\n      compensation under the said Scheme and,\n      therefore, the petitioner shall be paid a sum of\n      Rs.3,00,000/- (Rupees three lac only) by the\n      State of Bihar as she has been a victim of rape.\n      Needless to say, we have determined the\n      compensation regard being had to clause 4 of\n      the Scheme. The said amount shall be paid to\n      her within four weeks hence and compliance\n      report thereof shall be filed before the Registry\n      of this Court. As far as the other aspect of\n      compensation is concerned, the said aspect\n      shall be considered on 9.8.2017.”\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_30\">14.   We have narrated the facts in extenso so that the\n\ncontroversy can be appreciated in proper perspective and\n\nfurther the laxity on the part of the authorities and also\n\nthe approach of the High Court can be appositely\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">\f                                                               19</span>\n\ndeliberated upon. It is submitted by Ms. Vrinda Grover,\n\nlearned counsel for the appellant that she is entitled to\n\nget compensation from the State under the public law\n\nremedy as the authorities under the State have not acted\n\nwith quite promptitude in terminating the pregnancy and\n\nprocrastinated the matter, as a consequence of which,\n\nthe appellant is compelled to lead a life of terrible agony\n\nand anguish, and constant state of uncertainty. It is her\n\nsubmission that as the appellant was a destitute staying\n\nin a shelter home and neither the father or her siblings\n\nhad shown any concern because of social stigma and\n\ntheir      own   impecuniosity     and    the   husband       had\n\nabandoned her to her fate and preferred a divorce\n\npetition, there was no justification to obtain the consent\n\nof   the    father   or   the   husband   for   termination    of\n\npregnancy. That apart, she contends that the approach\n\nof the High Court is wholly fallacious since it seeds more\n\nconcerned with the future of the foetus but not the life of\n\nthe victim. It is canvassed by the learned counsel that\n\nthe appellant was thirty-five years old when she had gone\n\nto the hospital and expressed her willingness in no\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">\f                                                                20</span>\n\nuncertain terms to terminate her pregnancy as she had\n\nbeen raped and an F.I.R. has been lodged, it was the\n\nobligation of the competent authorities of the PMCH to\n\nproceed with the termination and not to cause delay\n\nwhich invited complications. According to her, when her\n\ncase fell squarely within the statutory framework, there\n\nwas    no reason to show slackness. She also contends\n\nthat the High Court has completely failed to appreciate\n\nthe spirit of the Act and has treated it as an adversarial\n\nlitigation     and    passed   the   order   which    not     only\n\nunsustainable in law but also projects total lack of\n\nsensitivity.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_31\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"113663\" id=\"span_32\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"501198\" id=\"span_33\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1628260\" id=\"span_34\">15.   Pyramiding        the    submission     for     grant     of\n\ncompensation from the State, learned counsel would\n\ncontend that when the appellant had gone to the PMCH,\n\nit was obligatory on the part of the authorities to proceed\n\nwith the termination and that apart, the State had, in a\n\nway, contested the writ petition. Learned counsel would\n\nfurther propound that the concept of ‘compelling State\n\ninterest’ is not applicable to the case at hand but the said\n\nconcept      was     unnecessarily   highlighted.    She    would\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">\f                                                                21</span>\n\ncanvass that when the statutory function is not carried\n\nout and the fundamental choice which is available to the\n\nappellant in law is totally curtailed and scuttled, the\n\nvictim is entitled for compensation, for the entire action\n\nhas caused her immense mental torture. She has drawn\n\nour      attention    to   the     affidavit    filed    by    the\n\nrespondent-State, where the State has taken a stand that\n\nthe consent of the father and the husband was\n\nnecessary, which was not the statutory warrant in the\n\ncase of the appellant.           Structuring the submission\n\npertaining to grant of compensation, Ms. Grover would\n\nsubmit that her choice not to exercise her reproductive\n\nrights    in   the   factual   matrix   has    been     completely\n\nshattered in contravention of the statutory provisions\n\nand the pronouncements of this Court as a consequence\n\nof which she is being compelled to carry the pregnancy to\n\nits full term that has caused incalculable harm and\n\nirreversible injury giving rise to emotional trauma. She\n\nwould contend, with all the humility at her command,\n\nthat when there is violation of such right because of the\n\nnegligence of the State functionaries,            the victim is\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">\f                                                       22</span>\n\nentitled to get compensation. To buttress the said\n\nsubmission, she has commended us to the authorities in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1628260/\" id=\"a_18\">Nilabati Behera v. State of Orissa6</a>,        <a href=\"/doc/501198/\" id=\"a_19\">D.K. Basu v.\n\nState of West Bengal7</a> and <a href=\"/doc/113663/\" id=\"a_20\">Chairman, Railway Board\n\nand others v.

She has further urged that before\n\nthe High Court, the State has shown an affirmative\n\nattitude and if any delay has been caused, it is because\n\nof the expression of the view by the High Court for which\n\nthe State cannot be found fault with. In essence, her\n\nsubmission is that the maxim, actus curiae neminem\n\ngravabit, shall protect the action of the State and it\n\ncannot be blamed for any procrastination.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_33\">17.

Furthermore, most of these mothers\n     are married women, and are under no particular\n     necessity to conceal their pregnancy.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">     2.     In recent years, when health services have\n     expanded and hospitals are availed of to the\n     fullest extent by all classes of society, doctors\n     have often been confronted with gravely ill or\n     dying pregnant women whose pregnant uterus\n     have been tampered with a view to causing an\n     abortion and consequently suffered very severely.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">     3.    There is thus avoidable wastage of the\n     mother’s health, strength and, sometimes, life.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_35\">     The proposed measure which seeks to liberalise\n     certain existing provisions relating to termination\n     of pregnancy has been conceived (1) as a health\n     measure–when there is danger to life or risk to\n     physical or mental health of the woman; (2) on\n     humanitarian grounds–such as when pregnancy\n     arises from a sex crime like rape or intercourse\n     with a lunatic woman, etc.; and (3) eugenic\n     grounds–where there is substantial risk that the\n     child, if born, would suffer from deformities and\n     diseases.”\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">\f                                                                  24</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_36\">18.

Once such a\n\nstatutory presumption is provided, the same comes\n\nwithin the compartment of grave injury to mental health.\n\nSub-Section (4) of <a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 3</a> requires consent of the\n\nguardian of a minor, or a major who is mentally ill\n\nperson.

In the instant case, the gravamen of the submission\n\nof the learned counsel for the appellant is that negligence\n\nand delay have been caused by the authorities of the\n\nState. Be it noted, learned counsel for the appellant has\n\nfiled a chart giving various dates to highlight the\n\nchronology of events. On a perusal of the same, it is\n\ndemonstrable that after the appellant was brought to\n\nShanti Kutir, it was noticed that she was pregnant. She\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">\f                                                         28</span>\n\nwas taken to PMCH. At that time, she was 13 weeks and\n\n6 days pregnant. In the midst of 18 th week, she expressed\n\nher desire to terminate her pregnancy and that was\n\ncommunicated by the Shanti Kutir to the hospital and,\n\nthereafter, she was taken to PMCH, where she made an\n\nallegation that she had been raped and expressed her\n\ndesire to terminate her pregnancy. Though she was taken\n\nto the hospital for termination of pregnancy, yet the\n\nhospital authorities instead of proceeding with the\n\ntermination, called the father of the appellant to sign the\n\nconsent form. According to the learned counsel for the\n\nappellant, while she had gone to the government hospital\n\nand clearly stated that she had been raped and further\n\nshe was taken by the persons from the Shanti Kutir,\n\nwhich is a Women Rehabilitation Centre, and further\n\nthere was no material that she was suffering from any\n\nmental illness, it was obligatory on the part of the\n\nhospital to terminate the pregnancy. Had that been done\n\nat the right time, the grave mental torture that she has\n\nbeen going through could have been avoided.       Learned\n\ncounsel also criticized the approach of the High Court in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">\f                                                          29</span>\n\nnot dealing with the matter with required amount of\n\nsensitivity and not adhering to the statutory provision\n\nthat when there is an allegation of rape, the pregnancy\n\ncan be terminated. The High Court directed for a Medical\n\nBoard to be constituted and after receipt of the report of\n\nthe Medical Board some time was consumed and,\n\nthereafter, also the High Court required the father of the\n\nappellant to file an affidavit giving his consent.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_45\">23.    We have already anlaysed in detail the factual score\n\nand the approach of the High Court. We do not have the\n\nslightest hesitation in saying that the approach of the\n\nHigh    Court   is   completely   erroneous.    The   report\n\nsubmitted by the IGIMS stated that termination of\n\npregnancy may need major surgical procedure along with\n\nsubsequent consequences such as bleeding, sepsis and\n\nanesthesia hazards, but there was no opinion that the\n\ntermination could not be carried out and it was risky to\n\nthe life of the appellant. There should have been a query\n\nin this regard by the High Court which it did not do.\n\nThat apart, the report shows that the appellant, who was\n\na writ petitioner before the High Court, was suffering\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_44\">\f                                                        30</span>\n\nfrom    mild   mental   retardation   and   she   was   on\n\nmedications and her condition was stable and she would\n\nrequire long term psychiatry treatment. The Medical\n\nBoard has not stated that she was suffering from any\n\nkind of mental illness. The appellant was thirty-five year\n\nold at that time. She was a major. She was able to allege\n\nthat she had been raped and that she wanted to\n\nterminate her pregnancy. PMCH, as we find, is definitely\n\na place where pregnancy can be terminated.

Thus, the opinion has to be formed by the registered\n\npractitioners as per the Act and they are required to form\n\nan opinion that continuance of pregnancy would involve\n\na grave mental or physical harm to her. We have already\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">\f                                                       34</span>\n\nreferred to Explanation 1 which includes allegation of\n\nrape. As is perceivable, the appellant had gone from a\n\nwomen rehabilitation centre, had given consent for\n\ntermination of pregnancy and had alleged about rape\n\ncommitted on her, but the termination was not carried\n\nout. In such a circumstance, we are obliged to hold that\n\nthere has been negligence in carrying out the statutory\n\nduty, as a result of which, the appellant has been\n\nconstrained to suffer grave mental injury.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_53\">27.   In such a situation, submits Ms. Grover, the State\n\nis bound to compensate the appellant under public law\n\nremedy. It is her proponement that the appellant was\n\nsuffering from mental retardation, but not from mental\n\nillness and the distinction is clear from the language of\n\nsub-section (4) of <a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_47\">Section 3</a> of the Act. That apart, her\n\ncontention is that the victim was a destitute and in such\n\na situation, impleadment of her husband and father for\n\nobtaining their consent was wholly unwarranted and, in\n\na way, allow time to ‘rule’.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_54\">28.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1500783\" id=\"span_49\">In <a href=\"/doc/1500783/\" id=\"a_48\">Suchita Srivastava</a> (supra), the High Court of\n\nPunjab &amp; Haryana ruled that it was in the best interests\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_50\">\f                                                          35</span>\n\nof a mentally retarded woman to undergo an abortion.\n\nThe victim had become pregnant as a result of an alleged\n\nrape that took place when she was an inmate at a\n\ngovernment-run      welfare    institution    located     in\n\nChandigarh and after discovery of her pregnancy, the\n\nChandigarh Administration, approached the High Court\n\nseeking approval for the termination of her pregnancy,\n\nkeeping in mind that in addition to being mentally\n\nretarded she was also an orphan who did not have any\n\nparent or guardian to look after her or her prospective\n\nchild. The High Court perused the preliminary medical\n\nopinion and constituted an expert body and, eventually,\n\ndirected the termination of pregnancy in spite of the\n\nexpert body’s findings which show that the victim had\n\nexpressed her willingness to bear a child.         In that\n\ncontext, the Court adverted to the distinction between\n\nthe ‘mental illness’ and ‘mental retardation’. It also noted\n\nthat the expert body’s findings were in favour of\n\ncontinuation of pregnancy and took note of the fact that\n\nthe victim had clearly given her willingness to bear a\n\nchild. In that context, the Court stated:</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_51\">\f                                                     36</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_38\">“The victim’s reproductive choice should be\nrespected in spite of other factors such as the\nlack of understanding of the sexual act as well\nas apprehensions about her capacity to carry\nthe pregnancy to its full term and the\nassumption     of   maternal     responsibilities\nthereafter. We have adopted this position since\nthe applicable statute clearly contemplates\nthat even a woman who is found to be\n“mentally retarded” should give her consent for\nthe termination of a pregnancy.”\n\nAnd again:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_39\">“There is no doubt that a woman’s right to\nmake reproductive choices is also a dimension\nof “personal liberty” as understood under\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_49\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India. It is\nimportant to recognise that reproductive\nchoices can be exercised to procreate as well\nas to abstain from procreating. The crucial\nconsideration is that a woman’s right to\nprivacy, dignity and bodily integrity should be\nrespected. This means that there should be no\nrestriction whatsoever on the exercise of\nreproductive choices such as a woman’s right\nto refuse participation in sexual activity or\nalternatively the insistence on use of\ncontraceptive methods. Furthermore, women\nare also free to choose birth control methods\nsuch as undergoing sterilisation procedures.\nTaken to their logical conclusion, reproductive\nrights include a woman’s entitlement to carry a\npregnancy to its full term, to give birth and to\nsubsequently raise children. However, in the\ncase of pregnant women there is also a\n“compelling State interest” in protecting the life\nof the prospective child. Therefore, the\ntermination of a pregnancy is only permitted\nwhen the conditions specified in the applicable\nstatute have been fulfilled. Hence, the\nprovisions of the <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_50\">MTP Act, 1971</a> can also be\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\">\f                                                         37</span>\n\n      viewed as reasonable restrictions that have\n      been placed on the exercise of reproductive\n      choices.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_55\">29.   Explaining the provision of the Act, the Court\n\nopined that ordinarily a pregnancy can be terminated\n\nonly when a medical practitioner is satisfied that a\n\ncontinuance of the pregnancy would involve risk to the\n\nlife of the pregnant woman or of grave injury to her\n\nphysical or mental health or when there is a substantial\n\nrisk that if the child were born, it would suffer from such\n\nphysical or mental abnormalities as to be seriously\n\nhandicapped. While the satisfaction of one medical\n\npractitioner is required for terminating a pregnancy\n\nwithin twelve weeks of the gestation period, two medical\n\npractitioners must be satisfied about either of these\n\ngrounds in order to terminate a pregnancy between\n\ntwelve to twenty weeks of the gestation period.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_56\">30.   The Court also took note of the provision that\n\ntermination of the pregnancy has been contemplated\n\nwhen the same is the result of a rape or a failure of birth\n\ncontrol methods, since both of these eventualities have\n\nbeen equated with a grave injury to the mental health of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_53\">\f                                                              38</span>\n\na woman. The Court emphasized that in all such\n\ncircumstances, the consent of the pregnant woman is an\n\nessential requirement for proceeding with the termination\n\nof pregnancy. The three-Judge Bench referred to the\n\nPersons with <a href=\"/doc/376202/\" id=\"a_51\">Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection\n\nof Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995</a> (for short,\n\n‘1995 Act’) and opined that in the said Act also “mental\n\nillness” has been defined as mental disorder other than\n\nmental retardation. The Court also took note of the\n\ndefinition of “mental retardation” under the 1995 Act.\n\nThe definition read as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_40\">      “2(r) ‘mental retardation’ means a condition of\n      arrested or incomplete development of mind of\n      a person which is specially characterised by\n      subnormality of intelligence.”\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_57\">31.   The Court also apprised itself that the same\n\ndefinition    of    “mental   retardation”   has    also   been\n\nincorporated under <a href=\"/doc/1333524/\" id=\"a_52\">Section 2(g)</a> of the National Trust for\n\nWelfare of Persons with Autism, Cerebral Palsy, Mental\n\nRetardation        and   Multiple   Disabilities   Act,    1999.\n\nAnalysing the provision of Act. The Court opined that\n\nwhile a guardian can make decisions on behalf of a\n\n“mentally ill person” as per <a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_53\">Section 3(4)(a)</a> of the 1971\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_54\">\f                                                          39</span>\n\nAct, the same cannot be done on behalf of a person who\n\nis in a condition of “mental retardation”. Thus, the\n\ndifference between the ‘mental illness’ and ‘mental\n\nretardation’ as recognized in law, was emphasised.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_58\">32.   The three-Judge Bench proceeded to address the\n\n‘best interest’ of the victim and invocation of the doctrine\n\nof parens patriae. In that context, it held:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_41\">      “As evident from its literal description, the\n      “best interests” test requires the Court to\n      ascertain the course of action which would\n      serve the best interests of the person in\n      question. In the present setting this means\n      that the Court must undertake a careful\n      inquiry of the medical opinion on the feasibility\n      of the pregnancy as well as social\n      circumstances faced by the victim. It is\n      important to note that the Court’s decision\n      should be guided by the interests of the victim\n      alone and not those of the other stakeholders\n      such as guardians or the society in general. It\n      is evident that the woman in question will\n      need care and assistance which will in turn\n      entail some costs. However, that cannot be a\n      ground for denying the exercise of reproductive\n      rights.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_59\">33.   After so stating, the Court adverted to the facts of\n\nthe case and came to hold that though the victim had\n\nbeen described as a person suffering from mild mental\n\nretardation, that did not mean that she was entirely\n\nincapable of making decision for herself. It discarded the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\">\f                                                         40</span>\n\n‘substituted judgment’ test, which requires the Court to\n\nstep into the shoes of a person who is considered to be\n\nmentally incapable and attempt to make the decision\n\nwhich the said person would have made, if she was\n\ncompetent to do so. The Court observed that it is a more\n\ncomplex inquiry but this test can only be applied to make\n\ndecisions on behalf of persons who are conclusively\n\nshown to be mentally incompetent. The Court noted that\n\nthere are varying degrees of mental retardation, namely,\n\nthose described as borderline, mild, moderate, severe and\n\nprofound instances of the same. Persons suffering from\n\nsevere and profound mental retardation usually require\n\nintensive care and supervision and a perusal of academic\n\nmaterials suggests that there is a strong preference for\n\nplacing     such    persons    in   an    institutionalised\n\nenvironment. However, persons with borderline, mild or\n\nmoderate mental retardation are capable of living in\n\nnormal social conditions even though they may need\n\nsome supervision and assistance from time to time.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_60\">34.   The   Court   referred   to   the   United   Nations\n\nDeclaration on the Rights of Mentally Retarded Persons,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_56\">\f                                                         41</span>\n\n1971 [GA Res 2856 (XXVI) of 20-12-1971] and relied on\n\nprinciple No.7 of the same. Principle No. 7 reads as\n\nfollows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_42\">      “Whenever mentally retarded persons are\n      unable, because of the severity of their\n      handicap, to exercise all their rights in a\n      meaningful way or it should become necessary\n      to restrict or deny some or all of these rights,\n      the procedure used for that restriction or\n      denial of rights must contain proper legal\n      safeguards against every form of abuse. This\n      procedure must be based on an evaluation of\n      the social capability of the mentally retarded\n      person by qualified experts and must be\n      subject to periodic review and to the right of\n      appeal to higher authorities.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_61\">35.   Placing reliance on the same, it observed thus:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_43\">      “In respecting the personal autonomy of\n      mentally retarded persons with regard to the\n      reproductive    choice    of   continuing    or\n      terminating a pregnancy, the <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_54\">MTP Act</a> lays\n      down such a procedure. We must also bear in\n      mind that India has ratified the Convention on\n      the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD)\n      on 1-10-2007 and the contents of the same are\n      binding on our legal system.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_44\">            x         x          x         x\n      It would also be proper to emphasise that\n      persons who are found to be in a condition of\n      borderline,    mild   or     moderate    mental\n      retardation are capable of being good parents.\n      Empirical studies have conclusively disproved\n      the eugenics theory that mental defects are\n      likely to be passed on to the next generation.\n      The said “eugenics theory” has been used in\n      the past to perform forcible sterilisations and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_57\">\f                                                         42</span>\n\n      abortions on mentally retarded persons.

Scott, “Sterilization of\n      Mentally Retarded Persons: Reproductive\n      Rights and Family Privacy”, Duke Law Journal\n      806-65 (November 1986).] We firmly believe\n      that such measures are anti-democratic and\n      violative of the guarantee of “equal protection\n      before the law” as <a href=\"/doc/1500783/\" id=\"a_55\">laid down in</a> <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_56\">Article 14</a> of\n      our Constitution.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_45\">      It is also pertinent to note that a condition of\n      “mental retardation” or developmental delay is\n      gauged on the basis of parameters such as\n      intelligence quotient (IQ) and mental age (MA)\n      which mostly relate to academic abilities. It is\n      quite possible that a person with a low IQ or\n      MA may possess the social and emotional\n      capacities that will enable him or her to be a\n      good parent. Hence, it is important to evaluate\n      each case in a thorough manner with due\n      weightage being given to medical opinion for\n      deciding whether a mentally retarded person is\n      capable        of      performing      parental\n      responsibilities.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_62\">36.   On the basis of the aforesaid analysis, the Court\n\nconcluded:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_46\">      “In our considered opinion, the language of the\n      <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_57\">MTP Act</a> clearly respects the personal\n      autonomy of mentally retarded persons who\n      are above the age of majority. Since none of\n      the other statutory conditions have been met\n      in this case, it is amply clear that we cannot\n      permit a dilution of the requirement of consent\n      for proceeding with a termination of\n      pregnancy. We have also reasoned that\n      proceeding with an abortion at such a late\n      stage (19-20 weeks of gestation period) poses\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_58\">\f                                                               43</span>\n\n      significant risks to the physical health of the\n      victim.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_63\">37.   In the said case, the Court took note of the fact that\n\nthe expert body which had examined the victim indicated\n\nthat the continuation of the pregnancy did not pose any\n\ngrave risk to the physical and mental health of the victim\n\nand that there was no indication that the prospective\n\nchild was likely to suffer from a congenital disorder.\n\nRegard being had to the totality of the facts and\n\ncircumstances of the case, it was directed that the best\n\nmedical facilities be made available so as to ensure\n\nproper care and supervision during the period of\n\npregnancy as well as for the post-natal care.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_64\">38.

Under the statutory\n\nframework, she was entitled to give her consent for\n\ntermination of pregnancy. As is evident, she did not\n\ndesire to bear a child.

It\nis also clear that liberty of the petitioner was\ncurtailed in violation of law. The freedom of an\nindividual has its sanctity. When the\nindividual liberty is curtailed in an unlawful\nmanner, the victim is likely to feel more\nanguished, agonised, shaken, perturbed,\ndisillusioned and emotionally torn. It is an\nassault on his/her identity. The said identity is\nsacrosanct under the Constitution. Therefore,\nfor curtailment of liberty, requisite norms are\nto be followed.

It\ndoes not require wisdom of a seer to visualise\nthat for some invisible reason, an attempt has\nbeen made to corrode the procedural\nsafeguards which are meant to sustain the\nsanguinity of liberty. The investigating agency,\nas it seems, has put its sense of accountability\nto law on the ventilator.

Therefore, we are\n\ninclined to think that the continuance of the injury\n\ncreates a dent in the mind and the appellant is compelled\n\nto suffer the same. One may have courage or cultivate\n\ncourage to face a situation, but the shock of rape is\n\nbound to chain and enslave her with the trauma she has\n\nfaced and cataclysm that she has to go through.

But a pregnant one, she has to be\n\ncompensated so that she lives her life with dignity and\n\nthe authorities of the State who were negligent would\n\nunderstand that truancy has no space in a situation of\n\nthe present kind. What needed is promptitude.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_81\">54.

She has been paid Rs. 3,00,000/-\n\nas she has been a victim of rape. It may be clearly stated\n\nthat grant of compensation for the negligence and the\n\nsuffering for which the authorities of the State are\n\nresponsible is different as it comes within the public law\n\nremedy and it has a different compartment. Keeping in\n\nview the mental injury that the victim has to suffer, we\n\nare disposed to think that the appellant should get a sum\n\nof    Rs.   10,00,000/-   (Rupees   ten   lakhs   only)   as\n\ncompensation from the State and the same shall be kept\n\nin a fixed deposit in her name so that she may enjoy the\n\ninterest.

That apart, it is directed,\n\nthat the child to be born, shall be given proper treatment\n\nand nutrition by the State and if any medical aid is\n\nnecessary, it shall also be provided.
