Mr. K.G.Raghavan, learned Senior Advocate,\n\nargued that<a href=\"/doc/125412981/\" id=\"a_11\"> S.53-A</a> of the Code is violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_12\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_13\">,\n\n20(3)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_14\">21</a> of the Constitution. He submitted that the\n\nSection confers on a Police Officer and the registered\n\nmedical practitioner, unguided, unfettered and unbridled\n\npower and thus, the provision is manifestly arbitrary. He\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                       7</span>\n\n\n\n\nsubmitted that the provision completely militates against\n\nthe fundamental rights guaranteed under Clause (3) of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/655638/\" id=\"a_15\">Article 20</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_16\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution, more\n\nparticularly,   &#x27;the   right     to       privacy    and   dignity&#x27;.   He\n\ncontended that<a href=\"/doc/125412981/\" id=\"a_17\"> S.53-A</a> should be construed strictly and\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_18\">Article 21</a> widely. He submitted that, as the impugned\n\nprovision enables a Police Officer to use force against an\n\narrested person in the matter of examination of such\n\nperson, the same being arbitrary, is unconstitutional. He\n\nsubmitted that extraction of body fluids from an accused,\n\nby use of physical force, causes physical pain and mental\n\nagony, amounting to &#x27;compulsive testimony&#x27; prohibited\n\nunder Clause (3) of <a href=\"/doc/655638/\" id=\"a_19\">Article 20.</a>               He submitted that the\n\npetitioner   being     potent,    which        was    made    clear    on\n\n20.10.2014, when the interim order was passed in this\n\npetition, there is no need for the Investigating Officer, to\n\nsubject the petitioner to medical examination under<a href=\"/doc/125412981/\" id=\"a_20\"> S.53-A</a>\n\nof the Code.

Mr.Ashok Haranahalli, learned Senior Advocate,\n\nargued that<a href=\"/doc/125412981/\" id=\"a_31\"> S.53-A</a> is inconsistent with the provisions of\n\nthe Code. He referred to the Karnataka Police Manual and\n\n<a href=\"/doc/12704/\" id=\"a_32\">S.197</a> of the Code.     According to him, the expression\n\n&quot;examination of his person&quot; appearing in Ss.53, 53-A and\n\n54 - cognate provisions, sanction only the external\n\nmedical examination of body of an accused and do not\n\nauthorise extraction of any fluids, without his consent and\n\nif the said provisions are not so interpreted, <a href=\"/doc/125412981/\" id=\"a_33\">S.53-A</a> fall\n\nfoul of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_34\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_35\">, 20(3)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_36\">21</a> of the Constitution and\n\nwould run against the ratio of the decision in SELVI&#x27;s case,\n\n(supra).   He contended that investigation by respondent\n\nNo.2 must be fair and the rights          of the accused,\n\nguaranteed under the Constitution and the statutory\n\nprovisions, should be protected. According to the learned\n\ncounsel, there is need for respondent No.2, to disclose to\n\nthe petitioner, the proposed test/s, as otherwise, the\n\naction would be wholly arbitrary. He submitted that<a href=\"/doc/125412981/\" id=\"a_37\"> S.53-A</a>\n\nvests unreasonably excessive power in a Police Officer in\n\ndeciding the choice of medical test, that too, without\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                                    10</span>\n\n\n\n\nintimating the accused in advance, with regard to the\n\nnature of test/s, to which he would be subjected to.

Mr. Krishna S.Dixit, learned Assistant Solicitor\n\nGeneral of India, stoutly defended<a href=\"/doc/125412981/\" id=\"a_38\"> S.53-A</a>.               He submitted\n\nthat the provision was inserted, as per Act No.25 of 2005,\n\nwith   effect    from        23.06.2006,     providing    for   medical\n\nexamination of an accused in rape case and attempt for\n\nrape case, based on the recommendations of the 84th and\n\n172nd report of the Law Commission of India.                          He\n\nsubmitted that in civilized legal systems the medical\n\nexamination of an accused and use of reasonable force are\n\nsanctioned either by law or by judicial decisions.                    He\n\nreferred to the &#x27;Convention against Torture and Other\n\nCruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment&#x27;\n\nadopted     by         the      General      Assembly       Resolution\n\nNo.A/RES/39/46 of 10th December, 1984 and &#x27;United\n\nNations Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                                       11</span>\n\n\n\n\nWomen&#x27;. He contended that the Court cannot strike down\n\na statutory provision for being arbitrary and unreasonable\n\nso as to substitute its own wisdom for that of the\n\nLegislature. He submitted that there being no challenge to\n\nthe impugned provision on the ground of lack of legislative\n\ncompetence and the challenge being only on the ground\n\nthat   it    is    arbitrary    and     unguided,    in    view   of    the\n\nConstitutional limitations, the provision cannot be struck\n\ndown on the ground that it is unreasonable or unjust. He\n\nsubmitted that unless a Constitutional infirmity is pointed\n\nout,   the        provision    cannot      be   struck    down    on    the\n\napprehension of unreasonableness or arbitrariness.                      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1752505\" id=\"span_20\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1330923\" id=\"span_21\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"758129\" id=\"span_22\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1732220\" id=\"span_23\">He\n\nsubmitted that<a href=\"/doc/125412981/\" id=\"a_39\"> S.53-A</a> satisfies the test of reasonableness\n\nas it has a rational nexus with the object sought to be\n\nachieved on account of the increased crime rate against\n\nwomen.        He further submitted that mere possibility of\n\nabuse of power cannot invalidate the provision made by\n\nthe    competent         Legislature       as    there    is   always    a\n\npresumption in favour of the Constitutionality of the\n\nprovision or the enactment, since it has to be presumed\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                                12</span>\n\n\n\n\nthat the Legislature understands and correctly appreciates\n\nthe need of its own people and that its laws are directed to\n\nproblems manifest by experience.

The same reads as follows:</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">       &quot;49. Where there is challenge to the constitutional validity\nof a law enacted by the legislature, the Court must keep in view\nthat there is always a presumption of constitutionality of an\nenactment, and a clear transgression of constitutional principles\nmust be shown. The fundamental nature and importance of the\nlegislative process needs to be recognized by the Court and due\nregard and deference must be accorded to the legislative process.\nWhere the legislation is sought to be challenged as being\nunconstitutional and violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_67\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution, the\nCourt must remind itself to the principles relating to the\napplicability of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_68\">Article 14</a> in relation to invalidation of legislation.\nThe two dimensions of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_69\">Article 14</a> in its application to legislation\nand rendering legislation invalid are now well recognised and\nthese are (i) discrimination, based on an impermissible or invalid\nclassification, and (ii) excessive delegation of powers; conferment\nof uncanalised and unguided powers on the executive, whether in\nthe form of delegated legislation or by way of conferment of\nauthority to pass administrative orders - if such conferment is\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">                                  19</span>\n\n\n\n\nwithout any guidance, control or checks, it is violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_70\">Article 14</a>\nof the Constitution. The Court also needs to be mindful that a\nlegislation does not become unconstitutional merely because there\nis another view or because another method may be considered to\nbe as good or even more effective, like any issue of social, or even\neconomic policy. It is well settled that the courts do not substitute\ntheir views on what the policy is.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_33\">                                          (emphasis supplied)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_34\">      18.    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"131822183\" id=\"span_39\">In view of the presumption of constitutionality\n\nof statute and with regard to the burden of proof, Apex\n\nCourt, in <a href=\"/doc/131822183/\" id=\"a_71\">DHARMENDRA KIRTHAL VS.

This Court\n       while acting as a sentinel on the qui vive to protect\n       fundamental rights guaranteed to the citizens of the\n       country must try to strike a just balance between the\n       fundamental rights and the larger and broader interests of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">                                  21</span>\n\n\n\n\n      society, so that when such a right clashes with the larger\n      interest of the country it must yield to the latter.&quot;</span>\n\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1959928\" id=\"span_47\">Again in <a href=\"/doc/1959928/\" id=\"a_77\">the said judgment</a>, it has been ruled thus: (<a href=\"/doc/1959928/\" id=\"a_78\">Pathumma</a>\ncase, SCC p.9 para 6)\n\n      &quot;6. It is obvious that the legislature is in the best position\n      to understand and appreciate the needs of the people as\n      enjoined by the Constitution to bring about social reforms\n      for the upliftment of the backward and the weaker sections\n      of the society and for the improvement of the lot of poor\n      people. The Court will, therefore, interfere in this process\n      only when the statute is clearly violative of the right\n      conferred on the citizen under Part III of the Constitution or\n      when the Act is beyond the legislative competence of the\n      legislature or such other grounds.&quot;</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"55842\" id=\"span_48\">27.

When examining a legislation from\n      the angle of its vires, the Court has to be resilient, not rigid,\n      forward-looking, not static, liberal, not verbal - in\n      interpreting the organic law of the nation. We must also\n      remember the constitutional proposition enunciated by the\n      U.S. Supreme Court in Munn v. Illinois, 24 L Ed 77,viz.,\n      &#x27;that courts do not substitute their social and economic\n      beliefs for the judgment of legislative bodies&#x27;. Moreover,\n      while trespasses will not be forgiven, a presumption of\n      constitutionality must colour judicial construction. These\n      factors, recognized by our Court, are essential to the modus\n      vivendi between the judicial and legislative branches of the\n      State, both working beneath the canopy of the\n      Constitution.&quot;\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">                                22</span><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_41\">\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_42\">      29.

What the section provides\n\nis &#x27;to use such force as is &quot;reasonably necessary&quot; for that\n\npurpose&#x27;. Thus, it is clear that there cannot be blackmail\n\nand / or torture of the person subjected to the examination\n\nby the registered medical practitioner. In my opinion, the\n\nmere fact that the section may be misused by a Police\n\nOfficer, is not a reflection of the vires of the section.       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1172674\" id=\"span_51\">In\n\nthis regard, the law was succinctly clarified by the Apex\n\nCourt, in <a href=\"/doc/1172674/\" id=\"a_84\">SUSHIL KUMAR SHARMA VS.

In pursuance of this\nline of reasoning, we agree with the appellant&#x27;s contention about\nthe applicability of the rule of &quot;ejusdem generis&quot;. It should also be\nnoted that the Explanation to <a href=\"/doc/633996/\" id=\"a_98\">Sections 53</a> CrPC does not\nenumerate certain other forms of medical examination that involve\ntestimonial acts, such as psychiatric examination among others.\nThis demonstrates that the amendment to this provision was\ninformed by a rational distinction between the examination of\nphysical substances and testimonial acts.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_54\">      ******               ******               ******\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_55\">      195.     We must remember that the law does provide for\nsome restrictions on &quot;personal liberty&quot; in the routine exercise of\npolice powers. For instance, the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_99\">CrPC</a> incorporates an elaborate\nscheme prescribing the powers of arrest, detention, interrogation,\nsearch and seizure. A fundamental premise of the criminal justice\nsystem is that the police and the judiciary are empowered to\nexercise a reasonable degree of coercive powers. Hence, the\nprovision that enables courts to order a person who is under\narrest to undergo a medical examination also provides for the use\nof &quot;force as is reasonably necessary&quot; for this purpose. It is evident\nthat the notion of &quot;personal liberty&quot; does not grant rights in the\nabsolute sense and the validity of restrictions placed on the same\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_63\">                                 27</span>\n\n\n\n\nneeds to be evaluated on the basis of criterion such as &quot;fairness,\nnon- arbitrariness, and reasonableness&quot;.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_56\">             ******               ******              ******\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_57\">      220. In the present case, written submissions made on\nbehalf of the respondents have tried to liken the compulsory\nadministration of the impugned techniques with the DNA profiling\ntechnique. In light of this attempted analogy, we must stress that\nthe DNA profiling technique has been expressly included among\nthe various forms of medical examination in the amended\nExplanation to <a href=\"/doc/633996/\" id=\"a_100\">Sections 53</a> CrPC. It must also be clarified that a\n&quot;DNA profile&quot; is different from a DNA sample which can be\nobtained from bodily substances. A DNA profile is a record created\non the basis of DNA samples made available to forensic experts.\nCreating and maintaining DNA profiles of offenders and suspects\nare useful practices since newly obtained DNA samples can be\nreadily matched with existing profiles that are already in the\npossession of law-enforcement agencies. The matching of DNA\nsamples is emerging as a vital tool for linking suspects to specific\ncriminal acts.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_58\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1626264\" id=\"span_64\">221.

Kathi Kalu Oghad</a>, AIR 1961 SC\n1808, the use of material samples such as fingerprints for the\npurpose of comparison and identification does not amount to a\ntestimonial act for the purpose of <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_102\">Article 20(3).</a> Hence, the taking\nand retention of DNA samples which are in the nature of physical\nevidence does not face constitutional hurdles in the Indian\ncontext.

The DNA stands for deoxyribonucleic acid, which is the\nbiological blueprint of every life. DNA is made-up of a double\nstandard structure consisting of a deoxyribose sugar and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_75\">                                     34</span>\n\n\n\n\nphosphate backbone, cross-linked with two types of nucleic acids\nreferred to as adenine and guanine, purines and thymine and\ncytosine pyrimidines. The most important role of DNA profile is in\nthe identification, such as an individual and his blood relations\nsuch    as    mother,   father,   brother,    and    so   on.   Successful\nidentification of skeleton remains can also be performed by DNA\nprofiling. DNA usually can be obtained from any biological\nmaterial such as blood, semen, saliva, hair, skin, bones, etc. The\nquestion as to whether DNA tests are virtually infallible may be a\nmoot question, but the fact remains that such test has come to\nstay and is being used extensively in the investigation of crimes\nand the court often accepts the views of the experts, especially\nwhen cases rest on circumstantial evidence. More than half a\ncentury, samples of human DNA began to be used in the criminal\njustice system. Of course, debate lingers over the safeguards that\nshould be required in testing samples and in presenting the\nevidence in court. DNA profile, however, is consistently held to be\nvalid and reliable, but of course, it depends on the quality control\nand quality assurance procedures in the laboratory. Close\nrelatives have more genes in common than individuals and\nvarious procedures have been proposed for dealing with a\npossibility that true source of forensic DNA is of close relative.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_74\">                                              (emphasis supplied)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_75\">        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"151550237\" id=\"span_76\">27.

Many a times, reliable, trustworthy, credible witnesses\nto the crime seldom come forward to depose before the court and\neven the hardened criminals get away from the clutches of law.\nEven the reliable witnesses for the prosecution turn hostile due to\nintimidation, fear and host of other reasons. The investigating\nagency has, therefore, to look for other ways and means to\nimprove the quality of investigation, which can only be through\nthe collection of scientific evidence. In this age of science, we have\nto build legal foundations that are sound in science as well as in\nlaw. Practices and principles that served in the past, now people\nthink, must give way to innovative and creative methods, if we\nwant to save our criminal justice system. Emerging new types of\ncrimes and their level of sophistication, the traditional methods\nand   tools   have   become   outdated, hence     the   necessity   to\nstrengthen the forensic science for crime detection. Oral evidence\ndepends on several facts, like power of observation, humiliation,\nexternal influence, forgetfulness etc., whereas forensic evidence is\nfree from those infirmities. Judiciary should also be equipped to\nunderstand and deal with such scientific materials. Constant\ninteraction of Judges with scientists, engineers would promote\nand widen their knowledge to deal with such scientific evidence\nand to effectively deal with criminal cases based on scientific\nevidence. We are not advocating that, in all cases, the scientific\nevidence is the sure test, but only emphasizing the necessity of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_82\">                                  38</span>\n\n\n\n\npromoting scientific evidence also to detect and prove crimes over\nand above the other evidence.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_48\">      31.

There is a clear-cut and well demarcated sphere of\nactivity in the field of crime detection and crime punishment.\nInvestigation of an offence is the field exclusively reserved for the\nexecutive through the police department the superintendence over\nwhich vests in the State Government. The executive which is\ncharged with a duty to keep vigilance over law and order situation\nis obliged to prevent crime and if an offence is alleged to have been\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_95\">                                  45</span>\n\n\n\n\ncommitted it is its bounden duty to investigate into the offence\nand bring the offender to book. Once it investigates and finds an\noffence having been committed it is its duty to collect evidence for\nthe purpose of proving the offence. Once that is completed and the\ninvestigating officer submits report to the Court requesting the\nCourt to take cognizance of the offence under <a href=\"/doc/32624072/\" id=\"a_155\">Section 190</a> of the\nCode its duty comes to an end. On a cognizance of the offence\nbeing taken by the Court the police function of investigation\ncomes to an end subject to the provision contained in <a href=\"/doc/147367599/\" id=\"a_156\">Section\n173(8)</a>, there commences the adjudicatory function of the judiciary\nto determine whether an offence has been committed and if so,\nwhether by the person or persons charged with the crime by the\npolice in its report to the Court, and to award adequate\npunishment according to law for the offence proved to the\nsatisfaction of the Court. There is thus a well defined and well\ndemarcated function in the field of crime detection and its\nsubsequent adjudication between the police and the Magistrate.\nThis has been recognised way back in King Emperor v. Khwaja\nNazir Ahmad, AIR 1994 PC 18, where the Privy Council observed\nas under:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_52\">      In India, as has been shown, there is a statutory right on\nthe part of the police to investigate the circumstances of an alleged\ncognizable crime without requiring any authority from the judicial\nauthorities and it would, as their Lordships think, be an\nunfortunate result if it should be held possible to interfere with\nthose statutory rights by an exercise of the inherent jurisdiction of\nthe Court.

In the criminal justice system the investigation of an\noffence is the domain of the police. The power to investigate into\nthe cognizable offences by the police officer is ordinarily not\nimpinged by any fetters. However, such power has to be exercised\nconsistent with the statutory provisions and for legitimate\npurpose. The courts ordinarily do not interfere in the matters of\ninvestigation    by   police,   particularly,    when    the   facts   and\ncircumstances do not indicate that the investigating officer is not\nfunctioning bona fide. In very exceptional cases, however, where\nthe Court finds that the police officer has exercised his\ninvestigatory powers in breach of the statutory provision putting\nthe personal liberty and/or the property of the citizen in jeopardy\nby illegal and improper use of the power or there is abuse of the\ninvestigatory power and process by the police officer or the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_98\">                                   47</span>\n\n\n\n\ninvestigation by the police is found to be not bona fide or the\ninvestigation is tainted with animosity, the Court may intervene to\nprotect the personal and/or property rights of the citizens.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_54\">       25. Lord Denning in his work &quot;The Due Process of Law&quot;,\nhas described the role of the police thus:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_55\">       &quot;In safeguarding our freedoms, the police play vital role.\n       Society for its defence needs a well-led, well-trained and\n       well-disciplined force or police whom it can trust; and\n       enough of them to be able to prevent crime before it\n       happens, or if it does happen, to detect it and bring the\n       accused to justice.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_56\">       The police, of course, must act properly. They must obey\n       the rules of right conduct. They must not extort confessions\n       by threats or promises. They must not search a man&#x27;s\n       house without authority. They must not use more force\n       than the occasion warrants.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_107\">       26. One of the responsibilities of the police is protection of\nlife, liberty and property of citizens. The investigation of offences is\none of the important duties the police has to perform. The aim of\ninvestigation is ultimately to search for truth and bring the\noffender to book.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_108\">                                             (emphasis supplied)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_109\">       43.
