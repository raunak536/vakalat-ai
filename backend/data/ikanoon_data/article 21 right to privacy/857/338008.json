Nos. 10 of 2006 and 6711 of 2007.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_2\">1. The legal questions in this batch of criminal appeals relate\n\nto    the   involuntary   administration   of   certain   scientific\n\ntechniques, namely narcoanalysis, polygraph examination and\n\nthe Brain Electrical Activation Profile (BEAP) test for the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                1</span>\n\fpurpose of improving investigation efforts in criminal cases.\n\nThis issue has received considerable attention since it involves\n\ntensions between the desirability of efficient investigation and\n\nthe preservation of individual liberties. Ordinarily the judicial\n\ntask is that of evaluating the rival contentions in order to\n\narrive at a sound conclusion. However, the present case is not\n\nan ordinary dispute between private parties. It raises pertinent\n\nquestions about the meaning and scope of fundamental rights\n\nwhich are available to all citizens. Therefore, we must examine\n\nthe implications of permitting the use of the impugned\n\ntechniques in a variety of settings.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_3\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_4\">2. Objections have been raised in respect of instances where\n\nindividuals who are the accused, suspects or witnesses in an\n\ninvestigation have been subjected to these tests without their\n\nconsent. Such measures have been defended by citing the\n\nimportance of extracting information which could help the\n\ninvestigating agencies to prevent criminal activities in the\n\nfuture as well as in circumstances where it is difficult to\n\ngather evidence through ordinary means. In some of the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                               2</span>\n\fimpugned judgments, reliance has been placed on certain\n\nprovisions of the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_1\">Code of Criminal Procedure</a>, 1973 and the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_2\">Indian Evidence Act, 1872</a> to refer back to the responsibilities\n\nplaced on citizens to fully co-operate with investigation\n\nagencies. It has also been urged that administering these\n\ntechniques does not cause any bodily harm and that the\n\nextracted information will be used only for strengthening\n\ninvestigation efforts and will not be admitted as evidence\n\nduring the trial stage. The assertion is that improvements in\n\nfact-finding during the investigation stage will consequently\n\nhelp to increase the rate of prosecution as well as the rate of\n\nacquittal. Yet another line of reasoning is that these scientific\n\ntechniques are a softer alternative to the regrettable and\n\nallegedly   widespread   use   of   `third   degree   methods&#x27;   by\n\ninvestigators.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_5\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_6\">3. The involuntary administration of the impugned techniques\n\nprompts questions about the protective scope of the `right\n\nagainst self-incrimination&#x27; which finds place in <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_3\">Article 20(3)</a> of\n\nour Constitution. In one of the impugned judgments, it has\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                               3</span>\n\fbeen held that the information extracted through methods\n\nsuch as `polygraph examination&#x27; and the `Brain Electrical\n\nActivation   Profile   (BEAP)   test&#x27;   cannot   be   equated   with\n\n`testimonial compulsion&#x27; because the test subject is not\n\nrequired to give verbal answers, thereby falling outside the\n\nprotective scope of <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_4\">Article 20(3).</a> It was further ruled that the\n\nverbal revelations made during a narcoanalysis test do not\n\nattract the bar of <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_5\">Article 20(3)</a> since the inculpatory or\n\nexculpatory nature of these revelations is not known at the\n\ntime of conducting the test. To address these questions among\n\nothers, it is necessary to inquire into the historical origins and\n\nrationale behind the `right against self-incrimination&#x27;. The\n\nprincipal questions are whether this right extends to the\n\ninvestigation stage and whether the test results are of a\n\n`testimonial&#x27; character, thereby attracting the protection of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_6\">Article 20(3).</a> Furthermore, we must examine whether relying\n\non the test results or materials discovered with the help of the\n\nsame creates a reasonable likelihood of incrimination for the\n\ntest subject.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_7\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                 4</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">\f4. We must also deal with arguments invoking the guarantee\n\nof `substantive due process&#x27; which is part and parcel of the\n\nidea of `personal liberty&#x27; protected by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_7\">Article 21</a> of the\n\nConstitution. The first question in this regard is whether the\n\nprovisions in the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_8\">Code of Criminal Procedure</a>, 1973 that\n\nprovide for `medical examination&#x27; during the course of\n\ninvestigation can be read expansively to include the impugned\n\ntechniques,    even    though    the      latter   are   not    explicitly\n\nenumerated. To answer this question, it will be necessary to\n\ndiscuss the principles governing the interpretation of statutes\n\nin light of scientific advancements. Questions have also been\n\nraised with respect to the professional ethics of medical\n\npersonnel involved in the administration of these techniques.\n\nFurthermore, <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_9\">Article 21</a> has been judicially expanded to\n\ninclude   a   `right   against   cruel,     inhuman      or    degrading\n\ntreatment&#x27;, which requires us to determine whether the\n\ninvoluntary   administration     of    the     impugned        techniques\n\nviolates this right whose scope corresponds with evolving\n\ninternational human rights norms. We must also consider\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                 5</span>\n\fcontentions that have invoked the test subject&#x27;s `right to\n\nprivacy&#x27;, both in a physical and mental sense.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_9\">5. The scientific validity of the impugned techniques has been\n\nquestioned and it is argued that their results are not entirely\n\nreliable. For instance, the narcoanalysis technique involves the\n\nintravenous administration of sodium pentothal, a drug which\n\nlowers inhibitions on part of the subject and induces the\n\nperson to talk freely. However, empirical studies suggest that\n\nthe drug-induced revelations need not necessarily be true.\n\nPolygraph examination and the BEAP test are methods which\n\nserve the respective purposes of lie-detection and gauging the\n\nsubject&#x27;s familiarity with information related to the crime.\n\nThese techniques are essentially confirmatory in nature,\n\nwherein inferences are drawn from the physiological responses\n\nof the subject. However, the reliability of these methods has\n\nbeen repeatedly questioned in empirical studies. In the context\n\nof criminal cases, the reliability of scientific evidence bears a\n\ncausal link with several dimensions of the right to a fair trial\n\nsuch as the requisite standard of proving guilt beyond\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                               6</span>\n\freasonable doubt and the right of the accused to present a\n\ndefence.    We    must    be   mindful    of    the   fact   that   these\n\nrequirements have long been recognised as components of\n\n`personal liberty&#x27; under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_10\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. Hence it\n\nwill   be   instructive   to gather      some    insights    about the\n\nadmissibility of scientific evidence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_10\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_11\">6. In the course of the proceedings before this Court, oral\n\nsubmissions were made by Mr. Rajesh Mahale, Adv. (Crl. App.\n\nNo. 1267 of 2004), Mr. Manoj Goel, Adv. (Crl.

At this stage, it will be useful to frame the questions of law\n\nand outline the relevant sub-questions in the following\n\nmanner:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_13\">\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">I. Whether the involuntary administration of the impugned\n\ntechniques   violates   the   `right   against   self-incrimination&#x27;\n\nenumerated in <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_11\">Article 20(3)</a> of the Constitution?\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">     I-A.

Before answering these questions, it is necessary to\n\nexamine the evolution and specific uses of the impugned\n\ntechniques. Hence, a description of each of the test procedures\n\nis followed by an overview of their possible uses, both within\n\nand outside the criminal justice system. It is also necessary to\n\ngauge the limitations of these techniques. Owing to the dearth\n\nof Indian decisions on this subject, we must look to precedents\n\nfrom foreign jurisdictions which deal with the application of\n\nthese techniques in the area of criminal justice.\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTIONS OF TESTS - USES, LIMITATIONS AND\n\nPRECEDENTS\n\n\n\nPolygraph Examination\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_15\">9. The origins of polygraph examination have been traced back\n\nto the efforts of Lombroso, a criminologist who experimented\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                               9</span>\n\fwith a machine that measured blood pressure and pulse to\n\nassess the honesty of persons suspected of criminal conduct.\n\nHis device was called a hydrosphygmograph. A similar device\n\nwas used by psychologist William Marston during World War I\n\nin espionage cases, which proved to be a precursor to its use\n\nin the criminal justice system. In 1921, John Larson\n\nincorporated the measurement of respiration rate and by 1939\n\nLeonard Keeler added skin conductance and an amplifier to\n\nthe parameters examined by a polygraph machine.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_16\">10. The theory behind polygraph tests is that when a subject\n\nis lying in response to a question, he/she will produce\n\nphysiological responses that are different from those that arise\n\nin the normal course. During the polygraph examination,\n\nseveral instruments are attached to the subject for measuring\n\nand recording the physiological responses. The examiner then\n\nreads these results, analyzes them and proceeds to gauge the\n\ncredibility of the subject&#x27;s answers. Instruments such as\n\ncardiographs,   pneumographs,      cardio-cuffs   and   sensitive\n\nelectrodes are used in the course of polygraph examinations.\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                              10</span>\n\fThey measure changes in aspects such as respiration, blood\n\npressure, blood flow, pulse and galvanic skin resistance. The\n\ntruthfulness or falsity on part of the subject is assessed by\n\nrelying on the records of the physiological responses. [See:\n\nLaboratory       Procedure     Manual   -   Polygraph   Examination\n\n(Directorate of Forensic Science, Ministry of Home Affairs,\n\nGovernment of India, New Delhi - 2005)]\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_17\">11.      There   are   three   prominent    polygraph   examination\n\ntechniques:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">  i.       The relevant-irrelevant (R-I) technique\n\n  ii.      The control question (CQ) technique\n\n  iii.     Directed Lie-Control (DLC) technique\n\nEach of these techniques includes a pre-test interview during\n\nwhich the subject is acquainted with the test procedure and\n\nthe examiner gathers the information which is needed to\n\nfinalize the questions that are to be asked. An important\n\nobjective of this exercise is to mitigate the possibility of a\n\nfeeling of surprise on part of the subject which could be\n\ntriggered by unexpected questions. This is significant because\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                   11</span>\n\fan expression of surprise could be mistaken for physiological\n\nresponses that are similar to those associated with deception.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">[Refer: David Gallai, `Polygraph evidence in federal courts:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">Should it be admissible?&#x27; 36 American Criminal Law Review\n\n87-116 (Winter 1999) at p. 91]. Needless to say, the polygraph\n\nexaminer should be familiar with the details of the ongoing\n\ninvestigation. To meet this end the investigators are required\n\nto share copies of documents such as the First Information\n\nReport (FIR), Medico-Legal Reports (MLR) and Post-Mortem\n\nReports (PMR) depending on the nature of the facts being\n\ninvestigated.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_18\">12. The control-question (CQ) technique is the most commonly\n\nused one and its procedure as well as scoring system has been\n\ndescribed in the materials submitted on behalf of CBI. The test\n\nconsists of control questions and relevant questions. The\n\ncontrol questions are irrelevant to the facts being investigated\n\nbut they are intended to provoke distinct physiological\n\nresponses, as well as false denials. These responses are\n\ncompared with the responses triggered by the relevant\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                              12</span>\n\fquestions. Theoretically, a truthful subject will show greater\n\nphysiological responses to the control questions which he/she\n\nhas   reluctantly   answered   falsely,   than   to   the   relevant\n\nquestions, which the subject can easily answer truthfully.\n\nConversely, a deceptive subject will show greater physiological\n\nresponses while giving false answers to relevant questions in\n\ncomparison to the responses triggered by false answers to\n\ncontrol questions. In other words, a guilty subject is more\n\nlikely to be concerned with lying about the relevant facts as\n\nopposed to lying about other facts in general. An innocent\n\nsubject will have no trouble in truthfully answering the\n\nrelevant questions but will have trouble in giving false answers\n\nto control questions. The scoring of the tests is done by\n\nassigning a numerical value, positive or negative, to each\n\nresponse given by the subject. After accounting for all the\n\nnumbers, the result is compared to a standard numerical\n\nvalue to indicate the overall level of deception. The net\n\nconclusion may indicate truth, deception or uncertainty.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                               13</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_19\">\f13. The use of polygraph examinations in the criminal justice\n\nsystem has been contentious. In this case, we are mainly\n\nconsidered with situations when investigators seek reliance on\n\nthese tests to detect deception or to verify the truth of previous\n\ntestimonies. Furthermore, litigation related to polygraph tests\n\nhas also involved situations where suspects and defendants in\n\ncriminal cases have sought reliance on them to demonstrate\n\ntheir innocence. It is also conceivable that witnesses can be\n\ncompelled to undergo polygraph tests in order to test the\n\ncredibility of their testimonies or to question their mental\n\ncapacity or to even attack their character.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_20\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_21\">14. Another controversial use of polygraph tests has been on\n\nvictims of sexual offences for testing the veracity of their\n\nallegations. While several states in the U.S.A. have enacted\n\nprovisions to prohibit such use, the text of the Laboratory\n\nProcedure Manual for Polygraph Examination [supra.] indicates\n\nthat this is an acceptable use. In this regard, Para 3.4 (v) of\n\nthe said Manual reads as follows:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_22\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                               14</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">\f     &quot;(v) In cases of alleged sex offences such as intercourse\n     with a female child, forcible rape, indecent liberties or\n     perversion, it is important that the victim, as well as the\n     accused, be made available for interview and polygraph\n     examination. It is essential that the polygraph examiner\n     get a first hand detailed statement from the victim, and\n     the interview of the victim precede that of the suspect or\n     witnesses. ...&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_23\">[The following article includes a table which lists out the\n\nstatutorily permissible uses of polygraph examination in the\n\ndifferent state jurisdictions of the United States of America:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">Henry T. Greely and Judy Illes, `Neuroscience based lie-\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">detection: The urgent need for regulation&#x27;, 33 American\n\nJournal of Law and Medicine, 377-421 (2007)]\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">15. The propriety of compelling the victims of sexual offences\n\nto   undergo   a   polygraph   examination    certainly   merits\n\nconsideration in the present case. It must also be noted that in\n\nsome jurisdictions polygraph tests have been permitted for the\n\npurpose of screening public employees, both at the stage of\n\nrecruitment and at regular intervals during the service-period.\n\nIn the U.S.A., the widespread acceptance of polygraph tests for\n\nchecking the antecedents and monitoring the conduct of\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                               15</span>\n\fpublic employees has encouraged private employers to resort\n\nto the same. In fact the Employee Polygraph Protection Act,\n\n1998 was designed to restrict their use for employee screening.\n\nThis development must be noted because the unqualified\n\nacceptance of `Lie-detector tests&#x27; in India&#x27;s criminal justice\n\nsystem   could     have    the    unintended      consequence      of\n\nencouraging their use by private parties.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_25\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_26\">16. Polygraph tests have several limitations and therefore a\n\nmargin   for   errors.   The   premise   behind    these   tests   is\n\nquestionable because the measured changes in physiological\n\nresponses are not necessarily triggered by lying or deception.\n\nInstead, they could be triggered by nervousness, anxiety, fear,\n\nconfusion or other emotions. Furthermore, the physical\n\nconditions in the polygraph examination room can also create\n\ndistortions in the recorded responses. The test is best\n\nadministered in comfortable surroundings where there are no\n\npotential distractions for the subject and complete privacy is\n\nmaintained. The mental state of the subject is also vital since\n\na person in a state of depression or hyperactivity is likely to\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                                 16</span>\n\foffer highly disparate physiological responses which could\n\nmislead the examiner. In some cases the subject may have\n\nsuffered from loss of memory in the intervening time-period\n\nbetween the relevant act and the conduct of the test. When the\n\nsubject does not remember the facts in question, there will be\n\nno self-awareness of truth or deception and hence the\n\nrecording of the physiological responses will not be helpful.\n\nErrors may also result from `memory-hardening&#x27;, i.e. a process\n\nby which the subject has created and consolidated false\n\nmemories about a particular incident. This commonly occurs\n\nin respect of recollections of traumatic events and the subject\n\nmay not be aware of the fact that he/she is lying.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_27\">17. The errors associated with polygraph tests are broadly\n\ngrouped into two categories, i.e., `false positives&#x27; and `false\n\nnegatives&#x27;. A `false positive&#x27; occurs when the results indicate\n\nthat a person has been deceitful even though he/she answered\n\ntruthfully. Conversely a `false negative&#x27; occurs when a set of\n\ndeceptive responses is reported as truthful. On account of\n\nsuch inherent complexities, the qualifications and competence\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                              17</span>\n\fof the polygraph examiner are of the utmost importance. The\n\nexaminer needs to be thorough in preparing the questionnaire\n\nand must also have the expertise to account for extraneous\n\nconditions that could lead to erroneous inferences.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_28\">18. However, the biggest concern about polygraph tests is that\n\nan examiner may not be able to recognise deliberate attempts\n\non part of the subject to manipulate the test results.    Such\n\n`countermeasures&#x27; are techniques which are deliberately used\n\nby the subject to create certain physiological responses in\n\norder to deceive the examiner. The intention is that by\n\ndeliberately enhancing one&#x27;s reaction to the control questions,\n\nthe examiner will incorrectly score the test in favour of\n\ntruthfulness rather than deception. The most commonly used\n\n`countermeasures&#x27; are those of creating a false sense of mental\n\nanxiety and stress at the time of the interview, so that the\n\nresponses triggered by lying cannot be readily distinguished.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_29\">19. Since polygraph tests have come to be widely relied upon\n\nfor employee screening in the U.S.A., the U.S. Department of\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                              18</span>\n\fEnergy had requested the National Research Council of the\n\nNational Academies (NRC) to review their use for different\n\npurposes. The following conclusion was stated in its report,\n\ni.e. The Polygraph and Lie-Detection: Committee to Review the\n\nscientific evidence on the Polygraph (Washington D.C.: National\n\nAcademies Press, 2003) at pp. 212-213:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">     &quot;Polygraph Accuracy: Almost a century of research in\n     scientific psychology and physiology provides little basis\n     for the expectation that a polygraph test could have\n     extremely high accuracy. The physiological responses\n     measured by the polygraph are not uniquely related to\n     deception. That is, the responses measured by the\n     polygraph do not all reflect a single underlying process: a\n     variety of psychological and physiological processes,\n     including some that can be consciously controlled, can\n     affect polygraph measures and test results. Moreover,\n     most polygraph testing procedures allow for uncontrolled\n     variation in test administration (e.g., creation of the\n     emotional climate, selecting questions) that can be\n     expected to result in variations in accuracy and that limit\n     the level of accuracy that can be consistently achieved.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">     Theoretical Basis: The theoretical rationale for the\n     polygraph is quite weak, especially in terms of differential\n     fear, arousal, or other emotional states that are triggered\n     in response to relevant or comparison questions. We have\n     not found any serious effort at construct validation of\n     polygraph testing.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">     Research Progress: Research on the polygraph has not\n     progressed over time in the manner of a typical scientific\n     field. It has not accumulated knowledge or strengthened\n     its scientific underpinnings in any significant manner.\n</blockquote>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                              19</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">\f     Polygraph research has proceeded in relative isolation\n     from related fields of basic science and has benefited\n     little from conceptual, theoretical, and technological\n     advances in those fields that are relevant to the\n     psychophysiological detection of deception.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">     Future Potential: The inherent ambiguity of the\n     physiological measures used in the polygraph suggests\n     that further investments in improving polygraph\n     technique and interpretation will bring only modest\n     improvements in accuracy.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_30\">20. A Working Party of the British Psychological Society (BPS)\n\nalso came to a similar conclusion in a study published in\n\n2004. The key finding is reproduced below, [Cited from: A\n\nReview of the current scientific status and fields of application\n\nof polygraph deception detection - Final Report (6 October,\n\n2004) from The British Psychological Society (BPS) Working\n\nParty at p. 10]:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">     &quot;A polygraph is sometimes called a lie detector, but this\n     term is misleading. A polygraph does not detect lies, but\n     only arousal which is assumed to accompany telling a lie.\n     Polygraph examiners have no other option than to\n     measure deception in such an indirect way, as a pattern\n     of physiological activity directly related to lying does not\n     exist (Saxe, 1991). Three of the four most popular lie\n     detection     procedures       using      the      polygraph\n     (Relevant/Irrelevant Test, Control Question Test and\n     Directed Lie Test, ...) are built upon the premise that,\n     while answering so-called `relevant&#x27; questions, liars will\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                               20</span>\n\f     be more aroused than while answering so-called `control&#x27;\n     questions, due to a fear of detection (fear of getting\n     caught lying). This premise is somewhat naive as truth\n     tellers may also be more aroused when answering the\n     relevant questions, particularly: (i) when these relevant\n     questions are emotion evoking questions (e.g. when an\n     innocent man, suspected of murdering his beloved wife,\n     is asked questions about his wife in a polygraph test, the\n     memory of his late wife might re-awaken his strong\n     feelings about her); and (ii) when the innocent examinee\n     experiences fear, which may occur, for example, when\n     the person is afraid that his or her honest answers will\n     not be believed by the polygraph examiner. The other\n     popular test (Guilty Knowledge Test, ...) is built upon the\n     premise that guilty examinees will be more aroused\n     concerning certain information due to different orienting\n     reactions, that is, they will show enhanced orienting\n     responses when recognising crucial details of a crime.\n     This premise has strong support in psychophysiological\n     research (Fiedler, Schmidt &amp; Stahl, 2002).&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_31\">21. Coming to judicial precedents, a decision reported as Frye\n\nv. United States, (1923) 54 App DC 46, dealt with a precursor\n\nto the polygraph which detected deception by measuring\n\nchanges in systolic blood pressure. In that case the defendant\n\nwas subjected to this test before the trial and his counsel had\n\nrequested the court that the scientist who had conducted the\n\nsame should be allowed to give expert testimony about the\n\nresults. Both the trial court and the appellate court rejected\n\nthe request for admitting such testimony. The appellate court\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">                              21</span>\n\fidentified   the   considerations   that   would    govern    the\n\nadmissibility of expert testimony based on scientific insights. It\n\nwas held, Id. at p. 47:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">     &quot;... Just when a scientific principle or discovery crosses\n     the line between the experimental and demonstrable\n     stages is difficult to define. Somewhere in this twilight\n     zone the evidential force of the principle must be\n     recognized, and while courts will go a long way in\n     admitting expert testimony deduced from a well-\n     recognized scientific principle or discovery, the thing from\n     which the deduction is made must be sufficiently\n     established to have gained general acceptance in the\n     particular field in which it belongs.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">     We think the systolic blood pressure deception test has\n     not yet gained such standing and scientific recognition\n     among physiological and psychological authorities as\n     would justify the courts in admitting expert testimony\n     deduced from the discovery, development, and\n     experiments thus far made.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_32\">22. The standard of `general acceptance in the particular field&#x27;\n\ngoverned the admissibility of scientific evidence for several\n\ndecades. It was changed much later by the U.S. Supreme\n\nCourt in Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc., 509\n\nUS 579 (1993). In that case the petitioners had instituted\n\nproceedings against a pharmaceutical company which had\n\nmarketed `Bendectin&#x27;, a prescription drug. They had alleged\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">                               22</span>\n\fthat the ingestion of this drug by expecting mothers had\n\ncaused birth defects in the children born to them. To contest\n\nthese allegations, the pharmaceutical company had submitted\n\nan affidavit authored by an epidemiologist. The petitioners had\n\nalso submitted expert opinion testimony in support of their\n\ncontentions. The District Court had ruled in favour of the\n\ncompany by ruling that their scientific evidence met the\n\nstandard of `general acceptance in the particular field&#x27; whereas\n\nthe expert opinion testimony produced on behalf of the\n\npetitioners did not meet the said standard. The Court of\n\nAppeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld the judgment and the\n\ncase reached the U.S. Supreme Court which vacated the\n\nappellate court&#x27;s judgment and remanded the case back to the\n\ntrial court. It was unanimously held that the `general\n\nacceptance&#x27; standard articulated in Frye (supra.) had since\n\nbeen displaced by the enactment of the Federal Rules of\n\nEvidence in 1975, wherein Rule 702 governed the admissibility\n\nof expert opinion testimony that was based on scientific\n\nfindings. This rule provided that:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_33\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">                               23</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">\f     If scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will\n     assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to\n     determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert\n     by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education,\n     may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_34\">23. It was held that the trial court should have evaluated the\n\nscientific evidence as per Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of\n\nEvidence which mandates an inquiry into the relevance as well\n\nas the reliability of the scientific technique in question. The\n\nmajority opinion (Blackmun, J.) noted that the trial judge&#x27;s\n\nfirst step should be a preliminary assessment of whether the\n\ntestimony&#x27;s   underlying     reasoning    or   methodology      is\n\nscientifically valid and whether it can be properly applied to\n\nthe facts in issue. Several other considerations will be\n\napplicable, such as:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">  7 whether the theory or technique in question can be and\n\n     has been tested\n\n  7 whether it has been subjected to peer review and\n\n     publication\n\n  7 its known or potential error rate\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                               24</span>\n\f  7 the existence and maintenance of standards controlling\n\n     its operation\n\n  7 whether it has attracted widespread acceptance within\n\n     the scientific community\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_35\">24. It was further observed that such an inquiry should be a\n\nflexible one, and its focus must be solely on principles and\n\nmethodology, not on the conclusions that they generate. It was\n\nreasoned that instead of the wholesale exclusion of scientific\n\nevidence on account of the high threshold of proving `general\n\nacceptance in the particular field&#x27;, the same could be admitted\n\nand then challenged through conventional methods such as\n\ncross-examination, presentation of contrary evidence and\n\ncareful instructions to juries about the burden of proof. In this\n\nregard, the trial judge is expected to perform a `gate-keeping&#x27;\n\nrole to decide on the admission of expert testimony based on\n\nscientific techniques. It should also be kept in mind that Rule\n\n403 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, 1975 empowers a trial\n\njudge to exclude any form of evidence if it is found that its\n\nprobative value will be outweighed by its prejudicial effect.\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">                                25</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_36\">\f25. Prior to the Daubert decision (supra.), most jurisdictions\n\nin the U.S.A. had disapproved of the use of polygraph tests in\n\ncriminal cases. Some State jurisdictions had absolutely\n\nprohibited the admission of polygraph test results, while a few\n\nhad allowed consideration of the same if certain conditions\n\nwere met. These conditions included a prior stipulation\n\nbetween the parties to undergo these tests with procedural\n\nsafeguards such as the involvement of experienced examiners,\n\npresence   of   counsel   and    proper   recording   to   enable\n\nsubsequent scrutiny. A dissonance had also emerged in the\n\ntreatment of polygraph test results in the different Circuit\n\njurisdictions, with some jurisdictions giving trial judges the\n\ndiscretion to enquire into the reliability of polygraph test\n\nresults on a case-by-case basis.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_37\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_38\">26. For example, in United States v. Piccinonna, 885 F.2d\n\n1529 (11th Circ. 1989), it was noted that in some instances\n\npolygraphy satisfied the standard of `general acceptance in the\n\nparticular field&#x27; as required by Frye (supra.). It was held that\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">                                26</span>\n\fpolygraph testimony could be admissible under two situations,\n\nnamely when the parties themselves agree on a stipulation to\n\nthis effect or for the purpose of impeaching and corroborating\n\nthe testimony of witnesses. It was clarified that polygraph\n\nexamination results could not be directly used to bolster the\n\ntestimony of a witness. However, they could be used to attack\n\nthe credibility of a witness or even to rehabilitate one after\n\nhis/her credibility has been attacked by the other side.\n\nDespite these observations, the trial court did not admit the\n\npolygraph results on remand in this particular case.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\">27. However, after Daubert (supra.) prescribed a more liberal\n\ncriterion   for   determining   the   admissibility   of   scientific\n\nevidence, some Courts ruled that weightage could be given to\n\npolygraph results. For instance in United States v. Posado,\n\n57 F.3d 428 (5th Circ. 1995), the facts related to a pre-trial\n\nevidentiary hearing where the defendants had asked for the\n\nexclusion of forty-four kilograms of cocaine that had been\n\nrecovered from their luggage at an airport. The District Court\n\nhad refused to consider polygraph evidence given by the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">                                27</span>\n\fdefendants in support of their version of events leading up to\n\nthe seizure of the drugs and their arrest. On appeal, the Fifth\n\nCircuit   Court   held   that   the     rationale   for   disregarding\n\npolygraph evidence did not survive the Daubert decision. The\n\nCourt proceeded to remand the case to the trial court and\n\ndirected that the admissibility of the polygraph results should\n\nbe assessed as per the factors enumerated in Daubert\n\n(supra.). It was held, Id. at p. 434:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">     &quot;There can be no doubt that tremendous advances have\n     been made in polygraph instrumentation and technique\n     in the years since Frye. The test at issue in Frye\n     measured only changes in the subject&#x27;s systolic blood\n     pressure in response to test questions. [Frye v. United\n     States ...] Modern instrumentation detects changes in the\n     subject&#x27;s blood pressure, pulse, thoracic and abdominal\n     respiration, and galvanic skin response. Current research\n     indicates that, when given under controlled conditions,\n     the polygraph technique accurately predicts truth or\n     deception between seventy and ninety percent of the\n     time. Remaining controversy about test accuracy is\n     almost unanimously attributed to variations in the\n     integrity of the testing environment and the qualifications\n     of the examiner. Such variation also exists in many of the\n     disciplines and for much of the scientific evidence we\n     routinely find admissible under Rule 702. [See\n     McCormick on Evidence 206 at 915 &amp; n. 57] Further,\n     there is good indication that polygraph technique and the\n     requirements for professional polygraphists are becoming\n     progressively more standardized. In addition, polygraph\n     technique has been and continues to be subjected to\n     extensive study and publication. Finally, polygraph is\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">                                28</span>\n\f     now so widely used by employers and government\n     agencies alike.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">     To iterate, we do not now hold that polygraph\n     examinations are scientifically valid or that they will\n     always assist the trier of fact, in this or any other\n     individual case. We merely remove the obstacle of the per\n     se rule against admissibility, which was based on\n     antiquated concepts about the technical ability of the\n     polygraph and legal precepts that have been expressly\n     overruled by the Supreme Court.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_40\">                                   (internal citations omitted)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_41\">28. Despite these favourable observations, the polygraph\n\nresults were excluded by the District Court on remand.\n\nHowever, we have come across at least one case decided after\n\nDaubert (supra.) where a trial court had admitted expert\n\nopinion testimony about polygraph results. In United States\n\nv. Galbreth, 908 F. Supp 877 (D.N.M. 1995), the District\n\nCourt took note of New Mexico Rule of Evidence 11-707 which\n\nestablished standards for the admission of polygraph evidence.\n\nThe said provision laid down that polygraph evidence would be\n\nadmissible only when the following conditions are met: the\n\nexaminer must have had at least 5 years experience in\n\nconducting polygraph tests and 20 hours of continuing\n\neducation within the past year; the polygraph examination\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">                              29</span>\n\fmust be tape recorded in its entirety; the polygraph charts\n\nmust be scored quantitatively in a manner generally accepted\n\nas reliable by polygraph experts; all polygraph materials must\n\nbe provided to the opposing party at least 10 days before trial;\n\nand all polygraph examinations conducted on the subject\n\nmust be disclosed. It was found that all of these requirements\n\nhad been complied with in the facts at hand. The District\n\nCourt concluded with these words, Id. at p. 896:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">     &quot;... the Court finds that the expert opinion testimony\n     regarding the polygraph results of defendant Galbreth is\n     admissible. However, because the evidentiary reliability of\n     opinion testimony regarding the results of a particular\n     polygraph test is dependent upon a properly conducted\n     examination by a highly qualified, experienced and skilful\n     examiner, nothing in this opinion is intended to reflect\n     the judgment that polygraph results are per se\n     admissible. Rather, in the context of the polygraph\n     technique, trial courts must engage upon a case specific\n     inquiry to determine the admissibility of such testimony.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_42\">29. We were also alerted to the decision in United States v.\n\nCordoba, 104 F.3d 225 (9th. Circ. 1997). In that case, the\n\nNinth Circuit Court concluded that the position favouring\n\nabsolute exclusion of unstipulated polygraph evidence had\n\neffectively been overruled in Daubert (supra.). The defendant\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">                              30</span>\n\fhad been convicted for the possession and distribution of\n\ncocaine since the drugs had been recovered from a van which\n\nhe had been driving. However, when he took an unstipulated\n\npolygraph test, the results suggested that he was not aware of\n\nthe presence of drugs in the van. At the trial stage, the\n\nprosecution had moved to suppress the test results and the\n\nDistrict   Court   had   accordingly   excluded   the   polygraph\n\nevidence. However, the Ninth Circuit Court remanded the case\n\nback after finding that the trial judge should have adopted the\n\nparameters enumerated in Daubert (supra.) to decide on the\n\nadmissibility of the polygraph test results. It was observed, Id.\n\nat p. 228:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">     &quot;With this holding, we are not expressing new\n     enthusiasm for admission of unstipulated polygraph\n     evidence. The inherent problematic nature of such\n     evidence remains. As we noted in Brown, polygraph\n     evidence has grave potential for interfering with the\n     deliberative process. [Brown v. Darcy, 783 F.2d 1389 (9th\n     Circ. 1986) at 1396-1397] However, these matters are for\n     determination by the trial judge who must not only\n     evaluate the evidence under Rule 702, but consider\n     admission under Rule 403. Thus, we adopt the view of\n     Judge Jameson&#x27;s dissent in Brown that these are matters\n     which must be left to the sound discretion of the trial\n     court, consistent with Daubert standards.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">                               31</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_43\">\f30. The decisions cited above had led to some uncertainty\n\nabout the admissibility of polygraph test results. However, this\n\nuncertainty was laid to rest by an authoritative ruling of the\n\nU.S. Supreme Court in United States v. Scheffer, 523 US\n\n303 (1998). In that case, an eight judge majority decided that\n\nMilitary Rule of Evidence 707 (which made polygraph results\n\ninadmissible in court-martial proceedings) did not violate an\n\naccused person&#x27;s Sixth Amendment right to present a defence.\n\nThe relevant part of the provision follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">      &quot;(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the\n      results of a polygraph examination, the opinion of a\n      polygraph examiner, or any reference to an offer to take,\n      failure to take, or taking of a polygraph examination,\n      shall not be admitted into evidence.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_44\">31. The facts were that Scheffer, a U.S. Air Force serviceman\n\nhad   faced   court-martial   proceedings     because   a   routine\n\nurinalysis showed that he had consumed methamphetamines.\n\nHowever, a polygraph test suggested that he had been truthful\n\nin denying the intentional consumption of the drugs. His\n\ndefence of `innocent ingestion&#x27; was not accepted during the\n\ncourt-martial proceedings and the polygraph results were not\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">                               32</span>\n\fadmitted in evidence. The Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals\n\naffirmed the decision given in the court-martial proceedings\n\nbut the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces reversed the\n\nsame by holding that an absolute exclusion of polygraph\n\nevidence (offered to rebut an attack on the credibility of the\n\naccused) would violate Scheffer&#x27;s Sixth Amendment right to\n\npresent a defence. Hence, the matter reached the Supreme\n\nCourt which decided that the exclusion of polygraph evidence\n\ndid not violate the said constitutional right.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_45\">32. Eight judges agreed that testimony about polygraph test\n\nresults should not be admissible on account of the inherent\n\nunreliability of the results obtained. Four judges agreed that\n\nreliance on polygraph results would displace the fact-finding\n\nrole of the jury and lead to collateral litigation. In the words of\n\nClarence Thomas, J., Id. at p. 309:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">     &quot;Rule 707 serves several legitimate interests in the\n     criminal trial process. These interests include ensuring\n     that only reliable evidence is introduced at trial,\n     preserving the jury&#x27;s role in determining credibility, and\n     avoiding litigation that is collateral to the primary\n     purpose of the trial. The rule is neither arbitrary nor\n     disproportionate in promoting these ends.

On the issue of reliability, the Court took note of some\n\nCircuit Court decisions which had permitted trial courts to\n\nconsider polygraph results in accordance with the Daubert\n\nfactors. However, the following stance was adopted, Id. at p.\n\n312:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">       &quot;... Although the degree of reliability of polygraph\n       evidence may depend upon a variety of identifiable\n       factors, there is simply no way to know in a particular\n       case whether a polygraph examiner&#x27;s conclusion is\n       accurate, because certain doubts and uncertainties\n       plague even the best polygraph exams. Individual\n       jurisdictions therefore may reasonably reach differing\n       conclusions as to whether polygraph evidence should be\n       admitted. We cannot say, then, that presented with such\n       widespread uncertainty, the President acted arbitrarily or\n       disproportionately in promulgating a per se rule\n       excluding all polygraph evidence.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_47\">34. Since a trial by jury is an essential feature of the criminal\n\njustice system in the U.S.A., concerns were expressed about\n\npreserving    the   jury&#x27;s   core    function   of   determining   the\n\ncredibility of testimony. It was observed, Id. at p. 314:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">       &quot; ... Unlike other expert witnesses who testify about\n       factual matters outside the jurors&#x27; knowledge, such as\n       the analysis of fingerprints, ballistics, or DNA found at a\n       crime scene, a polygraph expert can supply the jury only\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">                                    34</span>\n\f     with another opinion, in addition to its own, about\n     whether the witness was telling the truth. Jurisdictions,\n     in promulgating rules of evidence, may legitimately be\n     concerned about the risk that juries will give excessive\n     weight to the opinions of a polygrapher, clothed as they\n     are in scientific expertise and at times offering, as in\n     respondent&#x27;s case, a conclusion about the ultimate issue\n     in the trial. Such jurisdictions may legitimately determine\n     that the aura of infallibility attending polygraph evidence\n     can lead jurors to abandon their duty to assess\n     credibility and guilt. ...&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_48\">35. On the issue of encouraging litigation that is collateral to\n\nthe primary purpose of a trial, it was held, Id. at p. 314:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">     &quot;... Allowing proffers of polygraph evidence would\n     inevitably entail assessments of such issues as whether\n     the test and control questions were appropriate, whether\n     a particular polygraph examiner was qualified and had\n     properly interpreted the physiological responses, and\n     whether other factors such as countermeasures\n     employed by the examinee had distorted the exam\n     results. Such assessments would be required in each and\n     every case. It thus offends no constitutional principle for\n     the President to conclude that a per se rule excluding all\n     polygraph evidence is appropriate. Because litigation over\n     the admissibility of polygraph evidence is by its very\n     nature collateral, a per se rule prohibiting its admission\n     is not an arbitrary or disproportionate means of avoiding\n     it.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_49\">36. In the same case, Kennedy, J. filed an opinion which was\n\njoined by four judges. While there was agreement on the\n\nquestionable reliability of polygraph results, a different stand\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">                               35</span>\n\fwas taken on the issues pertaining to the role of the jury and\n\nthe concerns about collateral litigation. It was observed that\n\nthe inherent reliability of the test results is a sufficient ground\n\nto exclude the polygraph test results and expert testimony\n\nrelated to them. Stevens, J. filed a dissenting opinion in this\n\ncase.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_50\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_51\">37. We have also come across a decision of the Canadian\n\nSupreme Court in R v Beland, [1987] 36 C.C.C. (3d) 481. In\n\nthat case the respondents had been charged with conspiracy\n\nto commit robbery. During their trial, one of their accomplices\n\nhad given testimony which directly implicated them. The\n\nrespondents contested this testimony and after the completion\n\nof the evidentiary phase of the trial, they moved an application\n\nto re-open their defence while seeking permission for each of\n\nthem to undergo a polygraph examination and produce the\n\nresults in evidence. The trial judge denied this motion and the\n\nrespondents were convicted. However, the appellate court\n\nallowed their appeal from conviction and granted an order to\n\nre-open the trial and directed that the polygraph results be\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">                                36</span>\n\fconsidered. On further appeal, the Supreme Court of Canada\n\nheld that the results of a polygraph examination are not\n\nadmissible as evidence. The majority opinion explained that\n\nthe admission of polygraph test results would offend some well\n\nestablished rules of evidence. It examined the `rule against\n\noath-helping&#x27; which prohibits a party from presenting evidence\n\nsolely for the purpose of bolstering the credibility of a witness.\n\nConsideration was also given to the `rule against admission of\n\npast or out-of-court statements by a witness&#x27; as well as the\n\nrestrictions on producing `character evidence&#x27;. The discussion\n\nalso concluded that polygraph evidence is inadmissible as\n\n`expert evidence&#x27;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_52\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_53\">38. With regard to the `rule against admission of past or out-\n\nof-court statements by a witness&#x27;, McIntyre, J. observed (in\n\nPara. 11):\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">     &quot;... In my view, the rule against admission of consistent\n     out-of-court   statements     is   soundly     based  and\n     particularly apposite to questions raised in connection\n     with the use of the polygraph. Polygraph evidence when\n     tendered would be entirely self-serving and would shed\n     no light on the real issues before the court. Assuming, as\n     in the case at bar, that the evidence sought to be\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">                               37</span>\n\fadduced would not fall within any of the well recognized\nexceptions to the operation of the rule - where it is\npermitted to rebut the allegation of a recent fabrication or\nto show physical, mental or emotional condition - it\nshould be rejected. To do otherwise is to open the trial\nprocess     to   the    time-consuming     and     confusing\nconsideration of collateral issues and to deflect the focus\nof the proceedings from their fundamental issue of guilt\nor innocence. This view is summarized by D.W. Elliott in\n`Lie-Detector Evidence: Lessons from the American\nExperience&#x27; in Well and Truly Tried (Law Book Co., 1982),\nat pp. 129-30:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">      A defendant who attempts to put in the results of a\n      test showing this truthfulness on the matters in\n      issue is bound to fall foul of the rule against self-\n      serving statements or, as it is sometimes called, the\n      rule that a party cannot manufacture evidence for\n      himself, and the falling foul will not be in any mere\n      technical sense. The rule is sometimes applied in a\n      mechanical unintelligent way to exclude evidence\n      about which no realistic objection could be raised,\n      as the leading case, Gillie v. Posho shows; but\n      striking down defence polygraph evidence on this\n      ground would be no mere technical reflex action of\n      legal obscurantists. The policy behind the doctrine\n      is a fundamental one, and defence polygraph\n      evidence usually offends it fundamentally. As some\n      judges have pointed out, only those defendants who\n      successfully take examinations are likely to want\n      the results admitted. There is no compulsion to put\n      in the first test results obtained. A defendant can\n      take the test many times, if necessary &quot;examiner-\n      shopping&quot;, until he gets a result which suits him.\n      Even stipulated tests are not free of this taint,\n      because of course his lawyers will advise him to\n      have several secret trial runs before the prosecution\n      is approached. If nothing else, the dry runs will\n      habituate him to the process and to the expected\n      relevant questions.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">                         38</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_54\">\f39. On the possibility of using polygraph test results as\n\ncharacter evidence, it was observed (Para. 14):\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">     &quot;... What is the consequence of this rule in relation to\n     polygraph evidence? Where such evidence is sought to be\n     introduced it is the operator who would be called as the\n     witness and it is clear, of course, that the purpose of his\n     evidence would be to bolster the credibility of the accused\n     and, in effect, to show him to be of good character by\n     inviting the inference that he did not lie during the test.\n     In other words, it is evidence not of general reputation\n     but of a specific incident and its admission would be\n     precluded under the rule. It would follow, then, that the\n     introduction of evidence of the polygraph tests would\n     violate the character evidence rule.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_55\">40. Mcintyre, J. offered the following conclusions (at Paras. 18,\n\n19 and 20):\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">     &quot;18. In conclusion, it is my opinion, based upon a\n     consideration of rules of evidence long established and\n     applied in our courts, that the polygraph has no place in\n     the judicial process where it is employed as a tool to\n     determine or to test the credibility of witnesses. It is\n     frequently argued that the polygraph represents an\n     application of modern scientific knowledge and\n     experience to the task of determining the veracity of\n     human utterances. It is said that the courts should\n     welcome this device and not cling to the imperfect\n     methods of the past in such an important task. This\n     argument has a superficial appeal, but, in my view, it\n     cannot prevail in the face of realities of court procedures.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">     19. I would say at once that this view is not based on a\n     fear of the inaccuracies of the polygraph. On that\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">                               39</span>\n\fquestion we were not supplied with sufficient evidence to\nreach a conclusion. However, it may be said that even the\nfinding of a significant percentage of errors in its results\nwould not, by itself, be sufficient ground to exclude it as\nan instrument for use in the courts. Error is inherent in\nhuman affairs, scientific or unscientific. It exists within\nour established court procedures and must always be\nguarded against. The compelling reason, in my view, for\nthe exclusion of the evidence of polygraph results in\njudicial proceedings is two-fold. First, the admission of\npolygraph evidence would run counter to the well\nestablished rules of evidence which have been referred to.\nSecond, while there is no reason why the rules of\nevidence should not be modified where improvement will\nresult, it is my view that the admission of polygraph\nevidence will serve no purpose which is not already\nserved. It will disrupt proceedings, cause delays, and lead\nto numerous complications which will result in no\ngreater degree of certainty in the process than that which\nalready exists.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">20. Since litigation replaced trial by combat, the\ndetermination of fact, including the veracity of parties\nand their witnesses, has been the duty of judges or juries\nupon an evaluation of the statements of witnesses. This\napproach has led to the development of a body of rules\nrelating to the giving and reception of evidence and we\nhave developed methods which have served well and have\ngained a wide measure of approval. They have facilitated\nthe orderly conduct of judicial proceedings and are\ndesigned to keep the focus of the proceedings on the\nprincipal issue, in a criminal case, the guilt or innocence\nof the accused. What would be served by the introduction\nof evidence of polygraph readings into the judicial\nprocess? To begin with, it must be remembered that\nhowever scientific it may be, its use in court depends on\nthe human intervention of the operator. Whatever results\nare recorded by the polygraph instrument, their nature\nand significance reach the trier of fact through the mouth\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">                         40</span>\n\f     of the operator.

This test involves the intravenous administration of a drug\n\nthat causes the subject to enter into a hypnotic trance and\n\nbecome less inhibited. The drug-induced hypnotic stage is\n\nuseful for investigators since it makes the subject more likely\n\nto divulge information. The drug used for this test is sodium\n\npentothal, higher quantities of which are routinely used for\n\ninducing general anaesthesia in surgical procedures. This\n\ndrug is also used in the field of psychiatry since the\n\nrevelations can enable the diagnosis of mental disorders.\n\nHowever, we have to decide on the permissibility of resorting to\n\nthis technique during a criminal investigation, despite its&#x27;\n\nestablished uses in the medical field. The use of `truth-serums&#x27;\n\nand hypnosis is not a recent development. Earlier versions of\n\nthe narcoanalysis technique utilised substances such as\n\nscopolamine and sodium amytal. The following extracts from\n\nan article trace the evolution of this technique, [Cited from:\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">                              41</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">\fC.W.

This\n     anaesthesia was obtained by hypodermic injection of\n     solutions of morphine and scopolamine (also called\n     `hyoscine&#x27;)    followed    by    intermittent  chloroform\n     inhalations if needed. The pain relieving qualities of\n     morphine are well known. Scopolamine appears to have\n     the added property of blocking out memories of recent\n     events. By the combination of these drugs in suitable\n     dosage, morphine dulled labor pains without materially\n     interfering with the muscular contractions of labor, while\n     scopolamine wiped out subsequent memories of the\n     delivery room ordeal. The technique was widely used in\n     Europe but soon fell into disrepute among obstetricians\n     of this country, largely due to overdosage.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_40\">     During the period of extensive use of `twilight sleep&#x27; it\n     was a common experience that women who were under\n     drug influence, were extremely candid and uninhibited in\n     their statements. They often made remarks which\n     obviously would never have been uttered when in their\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">                              42</span>\n\f     normal state. Dr. Robert E. House, an observant\n     physician practising in Ferris, Texas, believed that a drug\n     combination which was so effective in the removal of\n     ordinary restraints and which produced such utter\n     candor, might be of value in obtaining factual\n     information from persons who were thought to be lying.\n     Dr. House&#x27;s first paper presented in 1922 suggested drug\n     administration quite similar to the standard `twilight\n     sleep&#x27; procedure: an initial dose of &lt; grain of morphine\n     sulphate together with 1/100 grain of scopolamine\n     hydrobromide, followed at 20-30 minute intervals with\n     smaller (1/200 - 1/400 grain) doses of scopolamine and\n     periods of light chloroform anaesthesia. Subjects were\n     questioned as they recovered from the light chloroform\n     anaesthesia and gave answers which subsequently\n     proved to be true. Altogether, Dr. House reported about\n     half-a-dozen cases, several of which were instrumental in\n     securing the release of convicts from State prisons, he\n     also observed that, after returning to their normal state,\n     these subjects had little or no recollection of what had\n     transpired during the period of interrogation. They could\n     not remember what questions had been asked, nor by\n     whom; neither could they recall any answers which they\n     had made.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_58\">42. The use of the `Scopolamine&#x27; technique led to the coining\n\nof the expression `truth serum&#x27;. With the passage of time,\n\ninjections of sodium amytal came to be used for inducing\n\nsubjects to talk freely, primarily in the field of psychiatry. The\n\nauthor cited above has further observed, Id. at p. 522:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_41\">     &quot;During World War II, this general technique of delving\n     into a subject&#x27;s inner consciousness through the\n     instrumentality of narcotic drugs was widely used in the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">                               43</span>\n\f     treatment of war neuroses (sometimes called `Battle\n     shock&#x27; or `shell shock&#x27;). Fighting men who had been\n     through terrifically disturbing experiences often times\n     developed symptoms of amnesia, mental withdrawal,\n     negativity, paralyses, or many other mental, nervous, and\n     physical derangements. In most instances, these patients\n     refused to talk about the experiences which gave rise to\n     the difficulty, and psychiatrists were at a loss to discover\n     the crux of the problem. To intelligently counteract such\n     a force, it was first necessary to identify it. Thus, the use\n     of sedative drugs, first to analyze the source of\n     disturbance (narcoanalysis) and later to obtain the\n     proper frame of mind in which the patient could and\n     would `talk out&#x27; his difficulties, and, as they say `get them\n     off his chest&#x27; - and thus relieve himself (narco-synthesis\n     or narco-therapy) - was employed with signal success.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_42\">     In the narcoanalysis of war neuroses a very light narcosis\n     is most desirable. With small doses of injectable\n     barbiturates (sodium amytal or sodium pentothal) or with\n     light inhalations of nitrous oxide or somnoform, the\n     subject pours out his pent-up emotions without much\n     prodding by the interrogator.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_59\">43. It has been shown that the Central Investigation Agency\n\n(C.I.A.) in the U.S.A. had conducted research on the use of\n\nsodium pentothal for aiding interrogations in intelligence and\n\ncounter-terrorism operations, as early as the 1950&#x27;s [See\n\n`Project MKULTRA - The CIA&#x27;s program of research in\n\nbehavioral modification&#x27;, On file with Schaffer Library of Drug\n\nPolicy, Text available from &lt;www.druglibrary.org&gt;].

Coming   to   the   test\n\nprocedure, when the drug (sodium pentothal) is administered\n\nintravenously,        the   subject       ordinarily        descends       into\n\nanaesthesia in four stages, namely:\n</p>\n<pre id=\"pre_2\">  (i)     Awake stage\n\n  (ii)    Hypnotic stage\n\n  (iii)   Sedative stage\n\n  (iv)    Anaesthetic stage\n\n\n\n</pre><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_60\">44.

This technique can serve several ends. The revelations\n\ncould help investigators to uncover vital evidence or to\n\ncorroborate pre-existing testimonies and prosecution theories.\n\nNarcoanalysis tests have also been used to detect `malingering&#x27;\n\n(faking of amnesia). The premise is that during the `hypnotic\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">                               47</span>\n\fstage&#x27; the subject is unable to wilfully suppress the memories\n\nassociated with the relevant facts. Thus, it has been urged\n\nthat drug-induced revelations can help to narrow down\n\ninvestigation efforts, thereby saving public resources. There is\n\nof course a very real possibility that information extracted\n\nthrough such interviews can lead to the uncovering of\n\nindependent evidence which may be relevant. Hence, we must\n\nconsider the implications of such derivative use of the drug-\n\ninduced   revelations,     even   if   such    revelations   are   not\n\nadmissible as evidence. We must also account for the uses of\n\nthis technique by persons other than investigators and\n\nprosecutors. Narcoanalysis tests could be requested by\n\ndefendants who want to prove their innocence. Demands for\n\nthis test could also be made for purposes such as gauging the\n\ncredibility of testimony, to refresh the memory of witnesses or\n\nto ascertain the mental capacity of persons to stand trial.\n\nSuch uses can have a direct impact on the efficiency of\n\ninvestigations as well as the fairness of criminal trials.

It is also important to be aware of the limitations of the\n\n`narcoanalysis&#x27; technique. It does not have an absolute\n\nsuccess rate and there is always the possibility that the\n\nsubject will not reveal any relevant information. Some studies\n\nhave shown that most of the drug-induced revelations are not\n\nrelated to the relevant facts and they are more likely to be in\n\nthe nature of inconsequential information about the subjects&#x27;\n\npersonal lives. It takes great skill on part of the interrogators\n\nto extract and identify information which could eventually\n\nprove to be useful. While some persons are able to retain their\n\nability to deceive even in the hypnotic state, others can\n\nbecome extremely suggestible to questioning. This is especially\n\nworrying, since investigators who are under pressure to deliver\n\nresults could frame questions in a manner that prompts\n\nincriminatory responses. Subjects could also concoct fanciful\n\nstories in the course of the `hypnotic stage&#x27;. Since the\n\nresponses of different individuals are bound to vary, there is\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">                               49</span>\n\fno   uniform   criteria   for   evaluating   the   efficacy   of   the\n\n`narcoanalysis&#x27; technique.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_66\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_67\">48. In an article published in 1951, C.W. Muehlberger (supra.)\n\nhad described a French case which attracted controversy in\n\n1948. Raymond Cens, who had been accused of being a Nazi\n\ncollaborator, appeared to have suffered an apoplectic stroke\n\nwhich also caused memory loss. The French Court trying the\n\ncase had authorised a board of psychiatrists to conduct an\n\nexamination for ascertaining the defendant&#x27;s amnesia. The\n\nnarcoanalysis technique was used in the course of the\n\nexamination and the defendant did not object to the same.\n\nHowever, the test results showed that the subject&#x27;s memory\n\nwas not impaired and that he had been faking amnesia. At the\n\ntrial, testimony about these findings was admitted, thereby\n\nleading to a conviction. Subsequently, Raymond Cens filed a\n\ncivil suit against the psychiatrists alleging assault and illegal\n\nsearch. However, it was decided that the board had used\n\nroutine psychiatric procedures and since the actual physical\n\ndamage to the defendant was nominal, the psychiatrists were\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_50\">                                 50</span>\n\facquitted. At the time, this case created quite a stir and the\n\nCouncil of the Paris Bar Association had passed a resolution\n\nagainst the use of drugs during interrogation. [Refer C.W.\n\nMuehlberger (1951) at p. 527; The Raymond Cens case has\n\nalso been discussed in the following article: J.P.

The first reference is to a decision from the State of\n\nMissouri reported as State v. Hudson, 314 Mo. 599 (1926). In\n\nthat case, the defence lawyer in a prosecution for rape\n\nattempted to rely on the expert testimony of a doctor. The\n\ndoctor in turn declared that he had questioned the defendant\n\nafter injecting a truth-serum and the defendant had denied his\n\nguilt while in a drug-induced state. The trial court had refused\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_51\">                               51</span>\n\fto admit the doctor&#x27;s testimony by finding it to be completely\n\nunreliable from a scientific viewpoint. The appellate court\n\nupheld the finding and made the following observation, Id. at\n\np. 602:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_46\">     &quot;Testimony of this character - barring the sufficient fact\n     that it cannot be classified otherwise than a self-serving\n     declaration - is, in the present state of human\n     knowledge, unworthy of serious consideration. We are\n     not told from what well this serum is drawn or in what\n     alembic its alleged truth compelling powers are distilled.\n     Its origin is as nebulous as its effect is uncertain. ...&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_69\">50. In State v. Lindemuth, 56 N.M. 237 (1952) the testimony\n\nof a psychiatrist was not admitted when he wanted to show\n\nthat the answers given by a defendant while under the\n\ninfluence of sodium pentothal supported the defendant&#x27;s plea\n\nof innocence in a murder case. The trial court&#x27;s refusal to\n\nadmit such testimony was endorsed by the appellate court,\n\nand it was noted, Id. at p. 243:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_47\">     &quot;Until the use of the drug as a means of procuring the\n     truth from people under its influence is accorded general\n     scientific recognition, we are unwilling to enlarge the\n     already immense field where medical experts, apparently\n     equally qualified, express such diametrically opposed\n     views on the same facts and conditions, to the despair of\n     the court reporter and the bewilderment of the fact-\n     finder.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\">                               52</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_70\">\f51. However, Andre Moenssens (1961) also took note of a case\n\nwhich appeared to endorse an opposing view. In People v.\n\nJones, 42 Cal. 2d 219 (1954), the trial court overruled the\n\nprosecution&#x27;s objection to the introduction of a psychiatrist&#x27;s\n\ntestimony on behalf of the defendant. The psychiatrist had\n\nconducted several tests on the defendant which included a\n\nsodium pentothal induced interview. The Court found that this\n\nwas not sufficient to exclude the psychiatrist&#x27;s testimony in its\n\nentirety. It was observed that even though the truth of\n\nstatements revealed under narcoanalysis remains uncertain,\n\nthe results of the same could be clearly distinguished from the\n\npsychiatrist&#x27;s overall conclusions which were based on the\n\nresults of all the tests considered together.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_71\">52. At the federal level, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth\n\nCircuit dealt with a similar issue in Lindsey v. United States,\n\n237 F. 2d 893 (9th Circ. 1956). In that case, the trial court had\n\nadmitted a psychiatrist&#x27;s opinion testimony which was based\n\non a clinical examination that included psychological tests and\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_53\">                               53</span>\n\fa sodium pentothal induced interview. The subject of the\n\ninterview was a fifteen-year old girl who had been sexually\n\nassaulted and had subsequently testified in a prosecution for\n\nrape. On cross-examination, the credibility of the victim&#x27;s\n\ntestimony had been doubted and in an attempt to rebut the\n\nsame, the prosecution had called on the psychiatrist. On the\n\nbasis of the results of the clinical examination, the psychiatrist\n\noffered his professional opinion that the victim had been\n\ntelling the truth when she had repeated the charges that were\n\npreviously made to the police. This testimony was admitted as\n\na prior consistent statement to rehabilitate the witness but not\n\nconsidered as substantive evidence. Furthermore, a tape\n\nrecording of the psychiatrist&#x27;s interview with the girl, while she\n\nwas under narcosis, was also considered as evidence. The jury\n\nwent on to record a finding of guilt.       When the case was\n\nbrought in appeal before the Ninth Circuit Court, the\n\nconviction was reversed on the ground that the defendant had\n\nbeen denied the `due process of law&#x27;. It was held that before a\n\nprior consistent statement made under the influence of a\n\nsodium pentothal injection could be admitted as evidence, it\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_54\">                               54</span>\n\fshould be scientifically established that the test is absolutely\n\naccurate and reliable in all cases. Although the value of the\n\ntest in psychiatric examinations was recognised, it was\n\npointed out that the reliability of sodium pentothal tests had\n\nnot been sufficiently established to warrant admission of its\n\nresults in evidence. It was stated that &quot;Scientific tests reveal\n\nthat people thus prompted to speak freely do not always tell\n\nthe truth&quot;. [Cited from Andre A. Moenssens (1961) at pp. 455-\n\n456]\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_72\">53. In Lawrence M. Dugan v. Commonwealth of Kentucky,\n\n333 S.W.2d. 755 (1960), the defendant had been given a truth\n\nserum test by a psychiatrist employed by him. The trial court\n\nrefused to admit the psychiatrist&#x27;s testimony which supported\n\nthe truthfulness of the defendant&#x27;s statement. The defendant\n\nhad pleaded innocence by saying that a shooting which had\n\nresulted in the death of another person had been an accident.\n\nThe trial court&#x27;s decision was affirmed on appeal and is was\n\nreasoned that no court of last resort has recognised the\n\nadmissibility of the results of truth serum tests, the principal\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\">                              55</span>\n\fground being that such tests have not attained sufficient\n\nrecognition of dependability and reliability.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_73\">54. The U.S. Supreme Court has also disapproved of the\n\nforensic uses of truth-inducing drugs in Townsend v. Sain,\n\n372 US 293 (1963). In that case a heroin addict was arrested\n\non the suspicion of having committed robbery and murder.\n\nWhile in custody he began to show severe withdrawal\n\nsymptoms, following which the police officials obtained the\n\nservices of a physician. In order to treat these withdrawal\n\nsymptoms, the physician injected a combined dosage of 1/8\n\ngrain of Phenobarbital and 1/230 grain of Hyoscine. Hyoscine\n\nis the same as `Scopolamine&#x27; which has been described earlier.\n\nThis dosage appeared to have a calming effect on Townsend\n\nand after the physician&#x27;s departure he promptly responded to\n\nquestioning   by   the   police    and   eventually   made   some\n\nconfessional statements. The petitioner&#x27;s statements were duly\n\nrecorded by a court reporter. The next day he was taken to the\n\noffice of the prosecutor where he signed the transcriptions of\n\nthe statements made by him on the previous day.

When the case came up for trial, the counsel for the\n\npetitioner brought a motion to exclude the transcripts of the\n\nstatements from the evidence. However, the trial judge denied\n\nthis motion and admitted the court reporter&#x27;s transcription of\n\nthe confessional statements into evidence. Subsequently, a\n\njury found Townsend to be guilty, thereby leading to his\n\nconviction. When the petitioner made a habeas corpus\n\napplication before a Federal District Court, one of the main\n\narguments advanced was that the fact of Scopolamine&#x27;s\n\ncharacter as a truth-serum had not been brought out at the\n\ntime of the motion to suppress the statements or even at the\n\ntrial before the State Court. The Federal District Court denied\n\nthe habeas corpus petition without a plenary evidentiary\n\nhearing, and this decision was affirmed by the Court of\n\nAppeals. Hence, the matter came before the U.S. Supreme\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_57\">                              57</span>\n\fCourt. In an opinion authored by Earl Warren, C.J. the\n\nSupreme Court held that the Federal District Court had erred\n\nin denying a writ of habeas corpus without giving a plenary\n\nevidentiary hearing to examine the voluntariness of the\n\nconfessional statements. Both the majority opinion as well as\n\nthe dissenting opinion (Stewart, J.) concurred on the finding\n\nthat a confession induced by the administration of drugs is\n\nconstitutionally inadmissible in a criminal trial. On this issue,\n\nWarren, C.J. observed, 372 US 293 (1963), at pp. 307-308:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_48\">     &quot;Numerous decisions of this Court have established the\n     standards governing the admissibility of confessions into\n     evidence. If an individual&#x27;s `will was overborne&#x27; or if his\n     confession was not `the product of a rational intellect and\n     a free will&#x27;, his confession is inadmissible because\n     coerced. These standards are applicable whether a\n     confession is the product of physical intimidation or\n     psychological pressure and, of course, are equally\n     applicable to a drug-induced statement. It is difficult to\n     imagine a situation in which a confession would be less\n     the product of a free intellect, less voluntary, than when\n     brought about by a drug having the effect of a `truth\n     serum&#x27;. It is not significant that the drug may have been\n     administered and the questions asked by persons\n     unfamiliar with hyoscine&#x27;s properties as a `truth serum&#x27;,\n     if these properties exist. Any questioning by police\n     officers which in fact produces a confession which is not\n     the product of a free intellect renders that confession\n     inadmissible.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_75\">                                     (internal citations omitted)\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_58\">                               58</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_76\">\f56.

At\n\nthe trial stage, one of the defendants testified that he suffered\n\nfrom amnesia and therefore he could not recall his alleged acts\n\nof telephoning the co-defendant and mailing threatening\n\nletters. In order to prove such amnesia his counsel sought the\n\nadmission of a taped interview between the defendant and a\n\npsychiatrist which had been conducted while the defendant\n\nwas under the influence of sodium amytal. The drug-induced\n\nstatements supposedly showed that the scheme was a joke or\n\na prank.

However, a perusal of that judgment\n\nshows that neither the actual statements made during\n\nnarcoanalysis interviews nor the expert testimony relating to\n\nthe same were given any weightage. The facts were that three\n\nindividuals, namely Solomon, Wesley and George (a minor at\n\nthe time of the crime) were accused of having committed\n\nrobbery and murder by arson. After their arrest, they had\n\nchanged their statements about the events relating to the\n\nalleged offences. Subsequently, Wesley gave his consent for a\n\nsodium   amytal    induced   interview   and   the   same   was\n\nadministered by a psychiatrist named Dr. Montgomery. The\n\nsame psychiatrist also conducted a sodium amytal interview\n\nwith George, at the request of the investigators.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_78\">58. At the trial stage, George gave testimony which proved to\n\nbe incriminatory for Solomon and Wesley. However, the\n\nstatements made by Wesley during the narcoanalysis interview\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_60\">                               60</span>\n\fwere not admitted as evidence and even the expert testimony\n\nabout the same was excluded. On appeal, the Ninth Circuit\n\nCourt held that there had been no abuse of discretion by the\n\ntrial court in considering the evidence before it. Solomon and\n\nWesley had contended that the trial court should have\n\nexcluded the testimony given by George before the trial judge,\n\nsince the same was based on the results of the sodium amytal\n\ninterview and was hence unreliable. The Court drew a\n\ndistinction   between   the   statements    made    during   the\n\nnarcoanalysis interview and the subsequent statements made\n\nbefore the trial court. It was observed that it was open to the\n\ndefendants to show that George&#x27;s testimony during trial had\n\nbeen bolstered by the previous revelations made during the\n\nnarcoanalysis interview. However, the connection between the\n\ndrug-induced revelations and the testimony given before the\n\ntrial court could not be presumed. It was further noted, Id. at\n\np. 1525:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_50\">     &quot;The only Ninth Circuit case addressing narcoanalysis\n     excluded a recording of and psychiatric testimony\n     supporting an interview conducted under the influence of\n     sodium pentothal, a precursor of sodium amytal.\n     [Lindsey v.

However, Wesley wanted to introduce expert testimony by\n\nDr. Montgomery which would explain the effects of sodium\n\namytal as well as the statements made during his own drug-\n\ninduced interview. The intent was to rehabilitate Wesley&#x27;s\n\ncredibility after the prosecution had impeached it with an\n\nearlier confession. The trial court had held that even though\n\nnarcoanalysis was not reliable enough to admit into evidence,\n\nDr. Montgomery could testify about the statements made to\n\nhim by Wesley, however without an explanation of the\n\ncircumstances. On this issue, the Ninth Circuit Court referred\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_62\">                              62</span>\n\fto the Frye standard for the admissibility of scientific\n\nevidence. It was also noted that the trial court had the\n\ndiscretion to draw the       necessary balance     between the\n\nprobative value of the evidence and its prejudicial effect. It\n\nagain took note of the decision in Lindsey v. United States,\n\n237 F. 2d 893 (1956), where the admission of a tape recording\n\nof a narcoanalysis interview along with an expert&#x27;s explanation\n\nof the technique was held to be a prejudicial error. The\n\nfollowing conclusion was stated, 753 F.2d 1522, at p. 1526:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_53\">     &quot;Dr. Montgomery testified also that narcoanalysis is\n     useful as a source of information that can be valuable if\n     verified through other sources. At one point he testified\n     that it would elicit an accurate statement of subjective\n     memory, but later said that the subject could fabricate\n     memories. He refused to agree that the subject would be\n     more likely to tell the truth under narcoanalysis than if\n     not so treated.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_54\">     Wesley wanted to use the psychiatric testimony to bolster\n     the credibility of his trial testimony that George started\n     the fatal fire. Wesley&#x27;s statement shortly after the fire was\n     that he himself set the fire. The probative value of the\n     statement while under narcoanalysis that George was\n     responsible, was the drug&#x27;s tendency to induce truthful\n     statements.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_55\">     Montgomery admitted that narcoanalysis does not\n     reliably induce truthful statements. The judge&#x27;s exclusion\n     of the evidence concerning narcoanalysis was not an\n     abuse of discretion.

The defendant\n\nhad been charged with murder and had sought reliance on the\n\ntestimony to show his unstable state of mind at the time of the\n\nhomicides.

Since a person subjected to the narcoanalysis technique is\n\nin a half-conscious state and loses awareness of time and\n\nplace, this condition can be compared to that of a person who\n\nis in a hypnotic state. In Horvath v. R, [1979] 44 C.C.C. (2d)\n\n385, the Supreme Court of Canada held that statements made\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_65\">                              65</span>\n\fin a hypnotic state were not voluntary and hence they cannot\n\nbe admitted as evidence. It was also decided that if the post-\n\nhypnotic statements relate back to the contents of what was\n\nsaid during the hypnotic state, the subsequent statements\n\nwould be inadmissible. In that case a 17 year old boy\n\nsuspected for the murder of his mother had been questioned\n\nby a police officer who had training in the use of hypnotic\n\nmethods.        During      the   deliberate          interruptions     in    the\n\ninterrogation sessions, the boy had fallen into a mild hypnotic\n\nstate and had eventually confessed to the commission of the\n\nmurder.     He      later    repeated        the    admissions     before     the\n\ninvestigating officers and signed a confessional statement. The\n\ntrial   judge      had    found   all        of    these   statements    to   be\n\ninadmissible, thereby leading to an acquittal. The Court of\n\nAppeal had reversed this decision, and hence an appeal was\n\nmade before the Supreme Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_83\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_84\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"607505\" id=\"span_66\">62.     Notably,    the     appellant        had    refused   to   undergo     a\n\nnarcoanalysis interview or a polygraph test. It was also evident\n\nthat he had not consented to the hypnosis. The multiple\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_67\">                                        66</span>\n\fopinions delivered in the case examined the criterion for\n\ndeciding the voluntariness of a statement. Reference was made\n\nto the well-known statement of Lord Summer in <a href=\"/doc/607505/\" id=\"a_14\">Ibrahim v. R</a>,\n\n[1914] A.C. 599 (P.C.), at p. 609:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_58\">      &quot;It has long been established as a positive rule of English\n      criminal law that no statement made by an accused is\n      admissible in evidence against him unless it is shown by\n      the prosecution to have been a voluntary statement, in\n      the sense that it has not been obtained from him either\n      by fear of prejudice or hope of advantage exercised or\n      held out by a person in authority.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_85\">63. In Horvath v. R (supra.), the question was whether\n\nstatements made under a hypnotic state could be equated\n\nwith those obtained by `fear of prejudice&#x27; or `hope of\n\nadvantage&#x27;. The Court ruled that the inquiry into the\n\nvoluntariness of a statement should not be literally confined to\n\nthese expressions. After examining several precedents, Spence\n\nJ.   held   that    the     total   circumstances   surrounding     the\n\ninterrogation      should     be    considered,   with   no   particular\n\nemphasis placed on the hypnosis. It was observed that in this\n\nparticular case the interrogation of the accused had resulted\n\nin his complete emotional disintegration, and hence the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_68\">                                     67</span>\n\fstatements given were inadmissible. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"607505\" id=\"span_69\">It was also held that the\n\nrule in <a href=\"/doc/607505/\" id=\"a_15\">Ibrahim v. R</a> (supra.) that a statement must be\n\ninduced by `fear of prejudice&#x27; or `hope of advantage&#x27; in order to\n\nbe considered involuntary was not a comprehensive test. The\n\nword `voluntary&#x27; should be given its ordinary and natural\n\nmeaning so that the circumstances which existed in the\n\npresent case could also be described as those which resulted\n\nin involuntary statements.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_86\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_87\">64. In a concurring opinion, Beetz., J. drew a comparison\n\nbetween statements made during hypnosis and those made\n\nunder the influence of a sodium-amytal injection. It was\n\nobserved, at Para. 91:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_59\">     &quot;91. Finally, voluntariness is incompatible not only with\n     promises and threats but actual violence. Had Horvath\n     made a statement while under the influence of an amytal\n     injection administered without his consent, the\n     statement would have been inadmissible because of the\n     assault, and presumably because also of the effect of the\n     injection on his mind. There was no physical violence in\n     the case at bar. There is not even any evidence of bodily\n     contact between Horvath and Sergeant Proke, but\n     through the use of an interrogation technique involving\n     certain physical elements such as a hypnotic quality of\n     voice and manner, a police officer has gained\n     unconsented access to what in a human being is of the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_70\">                               68</span>\n\f     utmost privacy, the privacy of his own mind. As I have\n     already indicated, it is my view that this was a form of\n     violence or intrusion of a moral or mental nature, more\n     subtle than visible violence but not less efficient in the\n     result than an amytal injection administered by force.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_88\">65. In this regard, the following observations are instructive\n\nfor the deciding the questions before us, at Paras. 117,118:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_60\">     &quot;117.

I refrain from commenting on such practices, short\n     of noting that even the consensual use of hypnosis and\n     narcoanalysis for evidentiary purposes may present\n     problems. Under normal police interrogation, a suspect\n     has the opportunity to renew or deny his consent to\n     answer each question, which is no longer the case once\n     he is, although by consent, in a state of hypnosis or\n     under the influence of a `truth serum&#x27;.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_89\">                                      (internal citation omitted)\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_90\">66. Our attention has also been drawn to the decision reported\n\nas Rock v. Arkansas, 483 US 44 (1987), in which the U.S.\n\nSupreme Court ruled that hypnotically-refreshed testimony\n\ncould be admitted as evidence. The constitutional basis for\n\nadmitting such testimony was the Sixth Amendment which\n\ngives every person a right to present a defence in criminal\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_71\">                              69</span>\n\fcases. However, the crucial aspect was that the trial court had\n\nadmitted the oral testimony given during the trial stage rather\n\nthan the actual statements made during the hypnosis session\n\nconducted earlier during the investigation stage. It was found\n\nthat such hypnotically-refreshed testimony was the only\n\ndefence available to the defendant in the circumstances. In\n\nsuch circumstances, it would of course be open to the\n\nprosecution to contest the reliability of the testimony given\n\nduring the trial stage by showing that it had been bolstered by\n\nthe statements made during hypnosis. It may be recalled that\n\na similar line of reasoning had been adopted in United States\n\nv. Solomon, 753 F. 2d 1522 (9th Circ. 1985), where for the\n\npurpose of admissibility of testimony, a distinction had been\n\ndrawn between the statements made during a narcoanalysis\n\ninterview and the oral testimony given during the trial stage\n\nwhich was allegedly based on the drug-induced statements.\n\nHence, the weight of precedents indicates that both the\n\nstatements made during narcoanalysis interviews as well as\n\nexpert testimony relating to the same have not been given\n\nweightage in criminal trials.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_91\">\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_72\">                                70</span>\n\fBrain Electrical Activation Profile (BEAP) test\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_92\">67. The third technique in question is the `Brain Electrical\n\nActivation Profile test&#x27;, also known as the `P300 Waves test&#x27;. It\n\nis a process of detecting whether an individual is familiar with\n\ncertain information by way of measuring activity in the brain\n\nthat is triggered by exposure to selected stimuli. This test\n\nconsists of examining and measuring `event-related potentials&#x27;\n\n(ERP) i.e. electrical wave forms emitted by the brain after it\n\nhas absorbed an external event. An ERP measurement is the\n\nrecognition of specific patterns of electrical brain activity in a\n\nsubject that are indicative of certain cognitive mental activities\n\nthat occur when a person is exposed to a stimulus in the form\n\nof   an   image   or   a   concept   expressed   in   words.   The\n\nmeasurement of the cognitive brain activity allows the\n\nexaminer to ascertain whether the subject recognised stimuli\n\nto   which   he/she    was   exposed.   [Cited   from:   Andre   A\n\nMoenssens, `Brain Fingerprinting - Can it be used to detect\n\nthe innocence of persons charged with a crime?&#x27; 70 University\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_73\">                                71</span>\n\fof Missouri at Kansas City Law Review 891-920 (Summer\n\n2002) at p. 893]\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_93\">68. By the late 19th century it had been established that the\n\nbrain functioned by emitting electrical impulses and the\n\ntechnology to measure them was developed in the form of the\n\nelectroencephalograph (EEG) which is now commonly used in\n\nthe medical field. Brain wave patterns observed through an\n\nEEG scan are fairly crude and may reflect a variety of\n\nunrelated brain activity functions. It was only with the\n\ndevelopment of computers that it became possible to sort out\n\nspecific wave components on an EEG and identify the\n\ncorrelation between the waves and specific stimuli. The P300\n\nwave is one such component that was discovered by Dr.\n\nSamuel Sutton in 1965. It is a specific event-related brain\n\npotential (ERP) which is triggered when information relating to\n\na specific event is recognised by the brain as being significant\n\nor surprising.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_94\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_74\">                              72</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_95\">\f69. The P300 waves test is conducted by attaching electrodes\n\nto the scalp of the subject, which measure the emission of the\n\nsaid wave components. The test needs to be conducted in an\n\ninsulated and air-conditioned room in order to prevent\n\ndistortions arising out of weather conditions. Much like the\n\nnarcoanalysis technique and polygraph examination, this test\n\nalso requires effective collaboration between the investigators\n\nand the examiner, most importantly for designing the stimuli\n\nwhich are called `probes&#x27;. Ascertaining the subject&#x27;s familiarity\n\nwith the `probes&#x27; can help in detecting deception or to gather\n\nuseful information. The test subject is exposed to auditory or\n\nvisual stimuli (words, sounds, pictures, videos) that are\n\nrelevant to the facts being investigated alongside other\n\nirrelevant words and pictures. Such stimuli can be broadly\n\nclassified as material `probes&#x27; and neutral `probes&#x27;. The\n\nunderlying theory is that in the case of guilty suspects, the\n\nexposure to the material probes will lead to the emission of\n\nP300 wave components which will be duly recorded by the\n\ninstruments.   By   examining        the   records   of   these   wave\n\ncomponents the examiner can make inferences about the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_75\">                                73</span>\n\findividual&#x27;s familiarity with the information related to the\n\ncrime.

The   P300      wave   test   was        the   precursor    to   other\n\nneuroscientific techniques such as `Brain Fingerprinting&#x27;\n\ndeveloped by Dr. Lawrence Farwell. The latter technique has\n\nbeen promoted in the context of criminal justice and has\n\nalready been the subject of litigation. There is an important\n\ndifference between the `P300 waves test&#x27; that has been used by\n\nForensic    Science    Laboratories       in    India   and      the   `Brain\n\nFingerprinting&#x27; technique. Dr. Lawrence Farwell has argued\n\nthat the P300 wave component is not an isolated sensory\n\nbrain effect but it is part of a longer response that continues to\n\ntake place after the initial P300 stimulus has occurred. This\n\nextended response bears a correlation with the cognitive\n\nprocessing that takes place slightly beyond the P300 wave and\n\ncontinues in the range of 300-800 milliseconds after the\n\nexposure    to   the    stimulus.        This    extended     brain     wave\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_76\">                                    74</span>\n\fcomponent has been named as the MERMER (Memory-and-\n\nEncoding-Related-Multifaceted-Electroencephalographic\n\nResponse) effect. [See generally: Lawrence A. Farwell, `Brain\n\nFingerprinting: A new paradigm in criminal investigations and\n\ncounter-terrorism&#x27;, (2001) Text can be downloaded from\n\n&lt;www.brainwavescience.com&gt;]\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_97\">71. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (FMRI) is another\n\nneuroscientific technique whose application in the forensic\n\nsetting has been contentious. It involves the use of MRI scans\n\nfor measuring blood flow between different parts of the brain\n\nwhich bears a correlation to the subject&#x27;s truthfulness or\n\ndeception. FMRI-based lie-detection has also been advocated\n\nas an aid to interrogations in the context of counter-terrorism\n\nand intelligence operations, but it prompts the same legal\n\nquestions that can be raised with respect to all of the\n\ntechniques mentioned above. Even though these are non-\n\ninvasive techniques the concern is not so much with the\n\nmanner in which they are conducted but the consequences for\n\nthe individuals who undergo the same. The use of techniques\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_77\">                              75</span>\n\fsuch as `Brain Fingerprinting&#x27; and `FMRI-based Lie-Detection&#x27;\n\nraise numerous concerns such as those of protecting mental\n\nprivacy and the harms that may arise from inferences made\n\nabout the subject&#x27;s truthfulness or familiarity with the facts of\n\na crime. [See generally: Michael S. Pardo, `Neuroscience\n\nevidence, legal culture and criminal procedure&#x27;, 33 American\n\nJournal of Criminal Law 301-337 (Summer 2006); Sarah E.\n\nStoller and Paul Root Wolpe, `Emerging neurotechnologies for\n\nlie detection and the fifth amendment&#x27;, 33 American Journal of\n\nLaw and Medicine 359-375 (2007)]\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_98\">72.   These   neuroscientific    techniques   could   also   find\n\napplication outside the criminal justice setting. For instance,\n\nHenry T. Greely (2005, Cited         below)   has argued     that\n\ntechnologies that may enable a precise identification of the\n\nsubject&#x27;s mental responses to specific stimuli could potentially\n\nbe used for market-research by business concerns for\n\nsurveying customer preferences       and developing targeted\n\nadvertising schemes. They could also be used to judge mental\n\nskills in the educational and employment-related settings\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_78\">                                76</span>\n\fsince cognitive responses are often perceived to be linked to\n\nacademic and professional competence. One can foresee the\n\npotential use of this technique to distinguish between students\n\nand employees on the basis of their cognitive responses. There\n\nare several other concerns with the development of these\n\n`mind-reading&#x27; technologies especially those relating to the\n\nprivacy of individuals. [Refer: Henry T. Greely, `Chapter 17:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_62\">The social effects of advances in neuroscience: Legal problems,\n\nlegal perspectives&#x27;, in Judy Illes (ed.), Neuroethics - Defining\n\nthe issues in theory, practice and policy (Oxford University\n\nPress, 2005) at pp. 245-263]\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_99\">73. Even though the P300 Wave component has been the\n\nsubject of considerable research, its uses in the criminal\n\njustice system have not received much scholarly attention. Dr.\n\nLawrence   Farwell&#x27;s   `Brain   Fingerprinting&#x27;   technique   has\n\nattracted considerable publicity but has not been the subject\n\nof any rigorous independent study. Besides this preliminary\n\ndoubt, an important objection is centred on the inherent\n\ndifficulty of designing the appropriate `probes&#x27; for the test.\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_79\">                                77</span>\n\fEven if the `probes&#x27; are prepared by an examiner who is\n\nthoroughly familiar with all aspects of the facts being\n\ninvestigated, there is always a chance that a subject may have\n\nhad prior exposure to the material probes. In case of such\n\nprior exposure, even if the subject is found to be familiar with\n\nthe probes, the same will be meaningless in the overall context\n\nof the investigation. For example, in the aftermath of crimes\n\nthat receive considerable media-attention the subject can be\n\nexposed to the test stimuli in many ways. Such exposure\n\ncould occur by way of reading about the crime in newspapers\n\nor magazines, watching television, listening to the radio or by\n\nword of mouth. A possibility of prior exposure to the stimuli\n\nmay also arise if the investigators unintentionally reveal\n\ncrucial facts about the crime to the subject before conducting\n\nthe test. The subject could also be familiar with the content of\n\nthe material probes for several other reasons.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_100\">74. Another significant limitation is that even if the tests\n\ndemonstrate familiarity with the material probes, there is no\n\nconclusive guidance about the actual nature of the subject&#x27;s\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_80\">                              78</span>\n\finvolvement in the crime being investigated. For instance a by-\n\nstander who witnessed a murder or robbery could potentially\n\nbe implicated as an accused if the test reveals that the said\n\nperson was familiar with the information related to the same.\n\nFurthermore, in cases of amnesia or `memory-hardening&#x27; on\n\npart of the subject, the tests could be blatantly misleading.\n\nEven if the inferences drawn from the `P300 wave test&#x27; are\n\nused for corroborating other evidence, they could have a\n\nmaterial bearing on a finding of guilt or innocence despite\n\nbeing based on an uncertain premise. [For an overview of the\n\nlimitations of these neuroscientific techniques, see: John G.\n\nNew, `If you could read my mind - Implications of neurological\n\nevidence for twenty-first century criminal jurisprudence&#x27;, 29\n\nJournal of Legal Medicine 179-197 (April-June 2008)]\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_101\">75. We have come across two precedents relatable to the use\n\nof `Brain Fingerprinting&#x27; tests in criminal cases. Since this\n\ntechnique is considered to be an advanced version of the P300\n\nWaves test, it will be instructive to examine these precedents.\n\nIn Harrington v. Iowa, 659 N.W.2d 509 (2003), Terry J.\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_81\">                              79</span>\n\fHarrington (appellant) had been convicted for murder in 1978\n\nand the same had allegedly been committed in the course of\n\nan   attempted     robbery.   A        crucial   component    of   the\n\nincriminating materials was the testimony of his accomplice.\n\nHowever, many years later it emerged that the accomplice&#x27;s\n\ntestimony was prompted by an offer of leniency from the\n\ninvestigating   police   and doubts were raised about              the\n\ncredibility of other witnesses as well. Subsequently it was\n\nlearnt that at the time of the trial, the police had not shared\n\nwith the defence some investigative reports that indicated the\n\npossible involvement of another individual in the said crime.\n\nHarrington had also undergone a `Brain Fingerprinting&#x27; test\n\nunder the supervision of Dr. Lawrence Farwell. The test\n\nresults showed that he had no memories of the `probes&#x27;\n\nrelating to the act of murder. Hence, Harrington approached\n\nthe District Court seeking the vacation of his conviction and\n\nan order for a new trial. Post-conviction relief was sought on\n\ngrounds   of    newly    discovered      evidence   which    included\n\nrecantation by the prosecution&#x27;s primary witness, the past\n\nsuppression of police investigative reports which implicated\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_82\">                                  80</span>\n\fanother suspect and the results of the `Brain Fingerprinting&#x27;\n\ntests. However, the District Court denied this application for\n\npost-conviction relief. This was followed by an appeal before\n\nthe Supreme Court of Iowa.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_102\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_103\">76. The appellate court concluded that Harrington&#x27;s appeal\n\nwas timely and his action was not time barred. The appellant\n\nwas granted relief in light of a `due process&#x27; violation, i.e. the\n\nfailure on part of the prosecution at the time of the original\n\ntrial to share the investigative reports with the defence. It was\n\nobserved that the defendant&#x27;s right to a fair trial had been\n\nviolated because the prosecution had suppressed evidence\n\nwhich was favourable to the defendant and clearly material to\n\nthe issue of guilt. Hence the case was remanded back to the\n\nDistrict Court. However, the Supreme Court of Iowa gave no\n\nweightage to the results of the `Brain Fingerprinting&#x27; test and\n\ndid not even inquire into their relevance or reliability. In fact it\n\nwas stated: &quot;Because the scientific testing evidence is not\n\nnecessary to a resolution of this appeal, we give it no further\n\nconsideration.&quot; [659 N.W.2d 509, at p. 516]\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_83\">                                81</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_104\">\f77. The second decision brought to our attention is Slaughter\n\nv. Oklahoma, 105 P. 3d 832 (2005). In that case, Jimmy Ray\n\nSlaughter had been convicted for two murders and sentenced\n\nto death. Subsequently, he filed an application for post-\n\nconviction relief before the Court of Criminal Appeals of\n\nOklahoma which attempted to introduce in evidence an\n\naffidavit and evidentiary materials relating to a `Brain\n\nFingerprinting&#x27; test. This test had been conducted by Dr.\n\nLawrence Farwell whose opinion was that the petitioner did\n\nnot have knowledge of the `salient features of the crime scene&#x27;.\n\nSlaughter also sought a review of the evidence gathered\n\nthrough DNA testing and challenged the bullet composition\n\nanalysis pertaining to the crime scene. However, the appellate\n\ncourt denied the application for post-conviction relief as well\n\nas the motion for an evidentiary hearing.

However, while the lower\n     court in Iowa appears to have admitted the evidence\n     under non-Daubert circumstances, the test did not\n     ultimately factor into the Iowa Supreme Court&#x27;s\n     published decision in any way.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_105\">Accordingly, the following conclusion was stated, Id. at p. 836:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_64\">      &quot;18.

As per the Laboratory Procedure manuals, the impugned\n\ntests are being conducted at the direction of jurisdictional\n\ncourts even without obtaining the consent of the intended test\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_85\">                              83</span>\n\fsubjects.   In   most     cases    these   tests      are   conducted\n\nconjunctively wherein the veracity of the information revealed\n\nthrough narcoanalysis is subsequently tested through a\n\npolygraph examination or the BEAP test. In some cases the\n\ninvestigators could first want to ascertain the capacity of the\n\nsubject to deceive (through polygraph examination) or his/her\n\nfamiliarity with the relevant facts (through BEAP test) before\n\nconducting a narcoanalysis interview. Irrespective of the\n\nsequence in which these techniques are administered, we have\n\nto decide on their permissibility in circumstances where any of\n\nthese   tests     are     compulsorily      administered,       either\n\nindependently or conjunctively.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_108\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_109\">79. It is plausible that investigators could obtain statements\n\nfrom individuals by threatening them with the possibility of\n\nadministering    either   of   these   tests.   The    person   being\n\ninterrogated     could    possibly      make       self-incriminating\n\nstatements on account of apprehensions that these techniques\n\nwill extract the truth. Such behaviour on part of investigators\n\nis more likely to occur when the person being interrogated is\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_86\">                                  84</span>\n\funaware of his/her legal rights or is intimidated for any other\n\nreason. It is a settled principle that a statement obtained\n\nthrough coercion, threat or inducement is involuntary and\n\nhence inadmissible as evidence during trial. However, it is not\n\nsettled whether    a statement made         on account of the\n\napprehension of being forcibly subjected to the impugned tests\n\nwill be involuntary and hence inadmissible. This aspect merits\n\nconsideration. It is also conceivable that an individual who has\n\nundergone either of these tests would be more likely to make\n\nself-incriminating statements when he/she is later confronted\n\nwith the results. The question in that regard is whether the\n\nstatements that are made subsequently should be admissible\n\nas evidence. The answers to these questions rest on the\n\npermissibility of subjecting individuals to these tests without\n\ntheir consent.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_110\">\n\nI.   Whether     the   involuntary      administration    of   the\n\nimpugned techniques violates the `right against self-\n\nincrimination&#x27;    enumerated       in   <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_16\">Article   20(3)</a>   of   the\n\nConstitution?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_111\">\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_87\">                              85</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_112\">\f80. Investigators could seek reliance on the impugned tests to\n\nextract information from a person who is suspected or accused\n\nof having committed a crime. Alternatively these tests could be\n\nconducted on witnesses to aid investigative efforts. As\n\nmentioned earlier, this could serve several objectives, namely\n\nthose of gathering clues which could lead to the discovery of\n\nrelevant evidence, to assess the credibility of previous\n\ntestimony or even to ascertain the mental state of an\n\nindividual. With these uses in mind, we have to decide\n\nwhether the compulsory administration of these tests violates\n\nthe `right against self-incrimination&#x27; which finds place in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_17\">Article 20(3)</a> of the Constitution of India. Along with the `rule\n\nagainst double-jeopardy&#x27; and the `rule against retrospective\n\ncriminalisation&#x27; enumerated in <a href=\"/doc/655638/\" id=\"a_18\">Article 20</a>, it is one of the\n\nfundamental protections that controls interactions between\n\nindividuals and the criminal justice system. <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_19\">Article 20(3)</a> reads\n\nas follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_65\">     &quot;No person accused of any offence shall be compelled to\n     be a witness against himself.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_88\">                              86</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_113\">\f81. The interrelationship between the `right against self-\n\nincrimination&#x27; and the `right to fair trial&#x27; has been recognised\n\nin most jurisdictions as well as international human rights\n\ninstruments. For example, the U.S. Constitution incorporates\n\nthe `privilege against self-incrimination&#x27; in the text of its Fifth\n\nAmendment. The meaning and scope of this privilege has been\n\njudicially moulded by recognising it&#x27;s interrelationship with\n\nother constitutional rights such as the protection against\n\n`unreasonable search and seizure&#x27; (Fourth amendment) and\n\nthe guarantee of `due process of law&#x27; (Fourteenth amendment).\n\nIn the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights\n\n(ICCPR), <a href=\"/doc/1694304/\" id=\"a_20\">Article 14(3)(g)</a> enumerates the minimum guarantees\n\nthat are to be accorded during a trial and states that everyone\n\nhas a right not to be compelled to testify against himself or to\n\nconfess guilt. In the European Convention for the Protection of\n\nHuman Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, <a href=\"/doc/241477/\" id=\"a_21\">Article 6(1)</a> states\n\nthat every person charged with an offence has a right to a fair\n\ntrial and <a href=\"/doc/531094/\" id=\"a_22\">Article 6(2)</a> provides that `Everybody charged with a\n\ncriminal offence shall be presumed innocent until proved\n\nguilty according to law&#x27;. The guarantee of `presumption of\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_89\">                                87</span>\n\finnocence&#x27; bears a direct link to the `right against self-\n\nincrimination&#x27; since compelling the accused person to testify\n\nwould place the burden of proving innocence on the accused\n\ninstead of requiring the prosecution to prove guilt.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_114\">82. In the Indian context, <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_23\">Article 20(3)</a> should be construed\n\nwith due regard for the inter-relationship between rights, since\n\nthis approach was recognised in Maneka Gandhi&#x27;s case,\n\n(1978) 1 SCC 248. Hence, we must examine the `right against\n\nself-incrimination&#x27; in respect of its relationship with the\n\nmultiple dimensions of `personal liberty&#x27; under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_24\">Article 21</a>,\n\nwhich include guarantees such as the `right to fair trial&#x27; and\n\n`substantive due process&#x27;. It must also be emphasized that\n\n<a href=\"/doc/655638/\" id=\"a_25\">Articles 20</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_26\">21</a> have a non-derogable status within Part III\n\nof our Constitution because the Constitution (Fourty-Fourth\n\namendment) Act, 1978 mandated that the right to move any\n\ncourt for the enforcement of these rights cannot be suspended\n\neven during the operation of a proclamation of emergency. In\n\nthis regard, <a href=\"/doc/1760044/\" id=\"a_27\">Article 359(1)</a> of the Constitution of India reads as\n\nfollows:-\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_115\">\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_90\">                               88</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_66\">\f     &quot;359.

Undoubtedly, <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_30\">Article 20(3)</a> has an exalted status in our\n\nConstitution and questions about its meaning and scope\n\ndeserve thorough scrutiny. In one of the impugned judgments,\n\nit was reasoned that all citizens have an obligation to co-\n\noperate with ongoing investigations. For instance reliance has\n\nbeen placed on <a href=\"/doc/1445515/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 39</a>, CrPC which places a duty on\n\ncitizens to inform the nearest magistrate or police officer if\n\nthey are aware of the commission of, or of the intention of any\n\nother person to commit the crimes enumerated in the section.\n\nAttention has also been drawn to the language of <a href=\"/doc/51689/\" id=\"a_32\">Section\n\n156(1)</a>, CrPC which states that a police officer in charge of a\n\npolice station is empowered to investigate cognizable offences\n\neven without an order from the jurisdictional magistrate.\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_91\">                              89</span>\n\fLikewise, our attention was drawn to <a href=\"/doc/184733/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 161(1)</a>, CrPC\n\nwhich empowers the police officer investigating a case to orally\n\nexamine any person who is supposed to be acquainted with\n\nthe facts and circumstances of the case. While the overall\n\nintent of these provisions is to ensure the citizens&#x27; cooperation\n\nduring the course of investigation, they cannot override the\n\nconstitutional protections given to accused persons. The\n\nscheme of the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_34\">CrPC</a> itself acknowledges this hierarchy between\n\nconstitutional and statutory provisions in this regard. For\n\ninstance, <a href=\"/doc/1110422/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 161(2)</a>, CrPC prescribes that when a person\n\nis being examined by a police officer, he is not bound to\n\nanswer such questions, the answers of which would have a\n\ntendency to expose him to a criminal charge or a penalty or\n\nforfeiture.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_117\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_118\">84. Not only does an accused person have the right to refuse\n\nto answer any question that may lead to incrimination, there\n\nis also a rule against adverse inferences being drawn from the\n\nfact of his/her silence. At the trial stage, <a href=\"/doc/1910943/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 313(3)</a> of the\n\nCrPC places a crucial limitation on the power of the court to\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_92\">                               90</span>\n\fput questions to the accused so that the latter may explain\n\nany circumstances appearing in the evidence against him. It\n\nlays down that the accused shall not render himself/herself\n\nliable to punishment by refusing to answer such questions, or\n\nby giving false answers to them. Further, Proviso (b) to <a href=\"/doc/3809/\" id=\"a_37\">Section\n\n315(1)</a> of CrPC mandates that even though an accused person\n\ncan be a competent witness for the defence, his/her failure to\n\ngive evidence shall not be made the subject of any comment by\n\nany of the parties or the court or give rise to any presumption\n\nagainst himself or any person charged together with him at the\n\ntrial. It is evident that <a href=\"/doc/1110422/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 161(2)</a>, CrPC enables a person\n\nto choose silence in response to questioning by a police officer\n\nduring the stage of investigation, and as per the scheme of\n\nSection 313(3) and Proviso (b) to Section 315(1) of the same\n\ncode, adverse inferences cannot be drawn on account of the\n\naccused person&#x27;s silence during the trial stage.\n\n\n\nHistorical origins of the `right against self-incrimination&#x27;\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_119\">85. The right of refusal to answer questions that may\n\nincriminate a person is a procedural safeguard which has\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_93\">                              91</span>\n\fgradually evolved in common law and bears a close relation to\n\nthe `right to fair trial&#x27;. There are competing versions about the\n\nhistorical   origins   of   this   concept.   Some   scholars   have\n\nidentified the origins of this right in the medieval period. In\n\nthat account, it was a response to the procedure followed by\n\nEnglish judicial bodies such as the Star Chamber and High\n\nCommissions which required defendants and suspects to take\n\nex officio oaths. These bodies mainly decided cases involving\n\nreligious non-conformism in a Protestant dominated society,\n\nas well as offences like treason and sedition. Under an ex\n\nofficio oath the defendant was required to answer all questions\n\nposed by the judges and prosecutors during the trial and the\n\nfailure to do so would attract punishments that often involved\n\nphysical torture. It was the resistance to this practice of\n\ncompelling the accused to speak which led to demands for a\n\n`right to silence&#x27;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_120\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_121\">86. In an academic commentary, Leonard Levy (1969) had\n\npointed out that the doctrinal origins of the right against self-\n\nincrimination could be traced back to the Latin maxim `Nemo\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_94\">                                   92</span>\n\ftenetur seipsum prodere&#x27; (i.e. no one is bound to accuse\n\nhimself) and the evolution of the concept of `due process of\n\nlaw&#x27; enumerated in the Magna Carta. [Refer: Leonard Levy,\n\n`The right against self-incrimination: history and judicial\n\nhistory&#x27;, 84(1) Political Science Quarterly 1-29 (March 1969)]\n\nThe use of the ex officio oath by the ecclesiastical courts in\n\nmedieval England had come under criticism from time to time,\n\nand the most prominent cause for discontentment came with\n\nits use in the Star Chamber and the High Commissions. Most\n\nscholarship has focussed on the sedition trial of John Lilburne\n\n(a vocal critic of Charles I, the then monarch) in 1637, when\n\nhe refused to answer questions put to him on the ground that\n\nhe had not been informed of the contents of the written\n\ncomplaint against him. John Lilburne went on to vehemently\n\noppose the use of ex-officio oaths, and the Parliament of the\n\ntime relented by abolishing the Star Chamber and the High\n\nCommission in 1641. This event is regarded as an important\n\nlandmark in the evolution of the `right to silence&#x27;.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_95\">                               93</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_122\">\f87. However, in 1648 a special committee of Parliament\n\nconducted an investigation into the loyalty of members whose\n\nopinions were offensive to the army leaders. The committee&#x27;s\n\ninquisitional conduct and its requirement that witnesses take\n\nan oath to tell the truth provoked opponents to condemn what\n\nthey regarded as a revival of Star Chamber tactics. John\n\nLilburne was once again tried for treason before this\n\ncommittee, this time for his outspoken criticism of the leaders\n\nwho had prevailed in the struggle between the supporters of\n\nthe monarch and those of the Parliament in the English civil\n\nwar. John Lilburne invoked the spirit of the Magna Carta as\n\nwell as the 1628 Petition of Right to argue that even after\n\ncommon-law indictment and without oath, he did not have to\n\nanswer questions against or concerning himself. He drew a\n\nconnection between the right against self-incrimination and\n\nthe guarantee of a fair trial by invoking the idea of `due\n\nprocess of law&#x27; which had been stated in the Magna Carta.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_123\">88. John H. Langbein (1994) has offered more historical\n\ninsights into the emergence of the `right to silence&#x27;. [John H.\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_96\">                              94</span>\n\fLangbein, `The historical origins of the privilege against self-\n\nincrimination at common law&#x27;, 92(5) Michigan Law Review\n\n1047-1085 (March 1994)] He draws attention to the fact that\n\neven though ex officio oaths were abolished in 1641, the\n\npractice of requiring defendants to present their own defence\n\nin criminal proceedings continued for a long time thereafter.\n\nThe Star Chamber and the High Commissions had mostly\n\ntried cases involving religious non-conformists and political\n\ndissenters, thereby attracting considerable criticism. Even\n\nafter their abolition, the defendants in criminal courts did not\n\nhave the right to be represented by a lawyer (`right to counsel&#x27;)\n\nor the right to request the presence of defence witnesses (`right\n\nof compulsory process&#x27;). Hence, defendants were more or less\n\ncompelled to testify on their own behalf. Even though the\n\nthreat of physical torture on account of remaining silent had\n\nbeen removed, the defendant would face a high risk of\n\nconviction if he/she did not respond to the charges by\n\nanswering the material questions posed by the judge and the\n\nprosecutor. In presenting his/her own defence during the trial,\n\nthere was a strong likelihood that the contents of such\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_97\">                               95</span>\n\ftestimony could strengthen the case of the prosecution and\n\nlead to conviction. With the passage of time, the right of a\n\ncriminal defendant to be represented by a lawyer eventually\n\nemerged in the common law tradition. A watershed in this\n\nregard was the Treason Act of 1696 which provided for a `right\n\nto counsel&#x27; as well as `compulsory process&#x27; in cases involving\n\noffences such as treason. Gradually, the right to be defended\n\nby a counsel was extended to more offences, but the role of the\n\ncounsel was limited in the early years. For instance defence\n\nlawyers could only help their clients with questions of law and\n\ncould not make submissions related to the facts.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_124\">89. The practice of requiring the accused persons to narrate or\n\ncontest the facts on their own corresponds to a prominent\n\nfeature of an inquisitorial system, i.e. the testimony of the\n\naccused is viewed as the `best evidence&#x27; that can be gathered.\n\nThe premise behind this is that innocent persons should not\n\nbe reluctant to testify on their own behalf. This approach was\n\nfollowed in the inquisitional procedure of the ecclesiastical\n\ncourts and had thus been followed in other courts as well. The\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_98\">                              96</span>\n\fobvious problem with compelling the accused to testify on his\n\nown behalf is that an ordinary person lacks the legal training\n\nto   effectively    respond     to        suggestive    and       misleading\n\nquestioning, which could come from the prosecutor or the\n\njudge. Furthermore, even an innocent person is at an inherent\n\ndisadvantage       in   an   environment        where     there    may   be\n\nunintentional irregularities in the testimony. Most importantly\n\nthe burden of proving innocence by refuting the charges was\n\nplaced on the defendant himself. In the present day, the\n\ninquisitorial conception of the defendant being the best source\n\nof evidence has long been displaced with the evolution of\n\nadversarial procedure in the common law tradition. Criminal\n\ndefendants     have     been   given        protections    such     as   the\n\npresumption of innocence, right to counsel, the right to be\n\ninformed of charges, the right of compulsory process and the\n\nstandard of proving guilt beyond reasonable doubt among\n\nothers. It can hence be stated that it was only with the\n\nsubsequent emergence of the `right to counsel&#x27; that the\n\naccused&#x27;s `right to silence&#x27; became meaningful. With the\n\nconsolidation of the role of defence lawyers in criminal trials, a\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_99\">                                     97</span>\n\fclear segregation emerged between the testimonial function\n\nperformed   by   the   accused        and   the   defensive   function\n\nperformed by the lawyer. This segregation between the\n\ntestimonial and defensive functions is now accepted as an\n\nessential feature of a fair trial so as to ensure a level-playing\n\nfield between the prosecution and the defence. In addition to a\n\ndefendant&#x27;s `right to silence&#x27; during the trial stage, the\n\nprotections were extended to the stage of pre-trial inquiry as\n\nwell. With the enactment of the Sir John Jervis Act of 1848,\n\nprovisions were made to advise the accused that he might\n\ndecline to answer questions put to him in the pre-trial inquiry\n\nand to caution him that his answers to pre-trial interrogation\n\nmight be used as evidence against him during the trial stage.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_125\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1938988\" id=\"span_100\">90.

While the\nadmissions or confessions of the prisoner, when\nvoluntarily and freely made, have always ranked high in\nthe scale of incriminating evidence, if an accused person\nbe asked to explain his apparent connection with a crime\nunder investigation, the case with which the questions\nput to him may assume an inquisitorial character, the\ntemptation to press the witness unduly, to browbeat him\nif he be timid or reluctant, to push him into a corner, and\nto entrap him into fatal contradictions, which is so\npainfully evident in many of the earlier state trials,\nnotably in those of Sir Nicholas Throckmorton, and Udal,\nthe Puritan minister, made the system so odious as to\ngive rise to a demand for its total abolition. The change in\nthe English criminal procedure in that particular seems\nto be founded upon no statute and no judicial opinion,\nbut upon a general and silent acquiescence of the courts\nin a popular demand. But, however adopted, it has\nbecome firmly embedded in English, as well as in\nAmerican jurisprudence. So deeply did the inequities of\nthe ancient system impress themselves upon the minds\nof the American colonists that the State, with one accord,\nmade a denial of the right to question an accused person\na part of their fundamental law, so that a maxim, which\nin England was a mere rule of evidence, became clothed\nin this country with the impregnability of a constitutional\nenactment.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_102\">                         99</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_126\">\fUnderlying rationale of the right against self-incrimination\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_127\">91. As mentioned earlier, `the right against self-incrimination&#x27;\n\nis now viewed as an essential safeguard in criminal procedure.\n\nIts   underlying    rationale      broadly    corresponds      with         two\n\nobjectives   -   firstly,   that   of     ensuring    reliability     of    the\n\nstatements made by an accused, and secondly, ensuring that\n\nsuch statements are made voluntarily. It is quite possible that\n\na person suspected or accused of a crime may have been\n\ncompelled to testify through methods involving coercion,\n\nthreats or inducements during the investigative stage. When a\n\nperson is compelled to testify on his/her own behalf, there is a\n\nhigher   likelihood    of   such     testimony       being   false.        False\n\ntestimony is undesirable since it impedes the integrity of the\n\ntrial and the subsequent verdict. Therefore, the purpose of the\n\n`rule against involuntary confessions&#x27; is to ensure that the\n\ntestimony considered during trial is reliable. The premise is\n\nthat involuntary statements are more likely to mislead the\n\njudge and the prosecutor, thereby resulting in a miscarriage of\n\njustice. Even during the investigative stage, false statements\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_103\">                                    100</span>\n\fare likely to cause delays and obstructions in the investigation\n\nefforts.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_128\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_129\">92. The concerns about the `voluntariness&#x27; of statements allow\n\na more comprehensive account of this right. If involuntary\n\nstatements were readily given weightage during trial, the\n\ninvestigators would have a strong incentive to compel such\n\nstatements - often through methods involving coercion,\n\nthreats, inducement or deception. Even if such involuntary\n\nstatements are proved to be true, the law should not\n\nincentivise the use of interrogation tactics that violate the\n\ndignity and bodily integrity of the person being examined. In\n\nthis sense, `the right against self-incrimination&#x27; is a vital\n\nsafeguard against torture and other `third-degree methods&#x27;\n\nthat could be used to elicit information. It serves as a check on\n\npolice behaviour during the course of investigation. The\n\nexclusion of compelled testimony is important, otherwise the\n\ninvestigators will be more inclined to extract information\n\nthrough such compulsion as a matter of course. The frequent\n\nreliance on such `short-cuts&#x27; will compromise the diligence\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_104\">                               101</span>\n\frequired for conducting meaningful investigations. During the\n\ntrial stage, the onus is on the prosecution to prove the charges\n\nlevelled against the defendant and the `right against self-\n\nincrimination&#x27; is a vital protection to ensure that the\n\nprosecution discharges the said onus.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_130\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_131\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1626264\" id=\"span_105\">93.

It has been felt that the\n     existence of such an easy way would tend to dissuade\n     persons in charge of investigation or prosecution from\n     conducting diligent search for reliable independent\n     evidence and from sifting of available materials with the\n     care necessary for ascertainment of truth.

In spite of the constitutionally entrenched status of the\n\nright   against    self-incrimination,   there   have   been   some\n\ncriticisms of the policy underlying the same. John Wigmore\n\n(1960) argued against a broad view of the privilege which\n\nextended the same to the investigative stage. [Refer: John\n\nWigmore,    `The     privilege   against   self-incrimination,   its\n\nconstitutional affectation, raison d&#x27;etre and miscellaneous\n\nimplications&#x27;, 51 Journal of Criminal Law, Criminology and\n\nPolice Science 138 (1960)] He has asserted that the doctrinal\n\norigins of the `rule against involuntary confessions&#x27; in evidence\n\nlaw and those of the `right to self-incrimination&#x27; were entirely\n\ndifferent and catered to different objectives. In the learned\n\nauthor&#x27;s opinion, the `rule against involuntary confessions&#x27;\n\nevolved on account of the distrust of statements made in\n\ncustody. The objective was to prevent these involuntary\n\nstatements from being considered as evidence during trial but\n\nthere was no prohibition against relying on statements made\n\ninvoluntarily during investigation. Wigmore argued that the\n\nprivilege against self-incrimination should be viewed as a right\n\nthat was confined to the trial stage, since the judge can\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_110\">                                 105</span>\n\fintervene to prevent an accused from revealing incriminating\n\ninformation at that stage, while similar oversight is not always\n\npossible during the pre-trial stage.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_136\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_137\">97. In recent years, scholars such as David Dolinko (1986),\n\nAkhil Reed Amar (1997) and Mike Redmayne (2007) among\n\nothers have encapsulated the objections to the scope of this\n\nright. [See: David Dolinko, `Is There a Rationale for the\n\nPrivilege   Against   Self-Incrimination?&#x27;,   33   University   of\n\nCalifornia Los Angeles Law Review 1063 (1986); Akhil Reed\n\nAmar, The Constitution and Criminal Procedure: First Principles\n\n(New Haven: Yale University Press, 1997) at pp. 65-70; Mike\n\nRedmayne,      `Re-thinking    the     Privilege   against   Self-\n\nincrimination&#x27;, 27 Oxford Journal of Legal Studies 209-232\n\n(Summer 2007)] It is argued that in aiming to create a fair\n\nstate-individual balance in criminal cases, the task of the\n\ninvestigators and prosecutors is made unduly difficult by\n\nallowing the accused to remain silent. If the overall intent of\n\nthe criminal justice system is to ensure public safety through\n\nexpediency in investigations and prosecutions, it is urged that\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_111\">                               106</span>\n\fthe privilege against self-incrimination protects the guilty at\n\nthe cost of such utilitarian objectives. Another criticism is that\n\nadopting a broad view of this right does not deter improper\n\npractices during investigation and it instead encourages\n\ninvestigators to make false representations to courts about the\n\nvoluntary or involuntary nature of custodial statements. It is\n\nreasoned that when investigators are under pressure to deliver\n\nresults there is an inadvertent tendency to rely on methods\n\ninvolving coercion, threats, inducement or deception in spite of\n\nthe legal prohibitions against them. Questions have also been\n\nraised about conceptual inconsistencies in the way that courts\n\nhave expanded the scope of this right. One such objection is\n\nthat if the legal system is obliged to respect the mental privacy\n\nof individuals, then why is there no prohibition against\n\ncompelled testimony in civil cases which could expose parties\n\nto adverse consequences. Furthermore, questions have also\n\nbeen asked about the scope of the privilege being restricted to\n\ntestimonial acts while excluding physical evidence which can\n\nbe extracted through compulsion.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_138\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_112\">                               107</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_139\">\f98. In response to John Wigmore&#x27;s thesis about the separate\n\nfoundations of the `rule against involuntary confessions&#x27;, we\n\nmust recognise the infusion of constitutional values into all\n\nbranches of law, including procedural areas such as the law of\n\nevidence. While the above-mentioned criticisms have been\n\nmade in academic commentaries, we must defer to the judicial\n\nprecedents that control the scope of <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_44\">Article 20(3).</a> For instance,\n\nthe interrelationship between the privilege against self-\n\nincrimination and the requirements of observing due process\n\nof law were emphasized by William Douglas, J. in Rochin v.\n\nCalifornia, 342 US 166 (1951), at p. 178:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_73\">     &quot;As an original matter it might be debatable whether the\n     provision in the Fifth Amendment that no person `shall\n     be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against\n     himself&#x27; serves the ends of justice. Not all civilized legal\n     procedures recognize it. But the choice was made by the\n     framers, a choice which sets a standard for legal trials in\n     this country. The Framers made it a standard of due\n     process for prosecutions by the Federal Government.

In order to evaluate this\n\nposition, we must answer the following questions:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_74\">  7 Firstly, we should clarify the scope of the `right against\n\n     self-incrimination&#x27; - i.e. whether it should be construed\n\n     as a broad protection that extends to the investigation\n\n     stage or should it be viewed as a narrower right confined\n\n     to the trial stage?\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_75\">  7 Secondly, we must examine the ambit of the words\n\n     `accused of any offence&#x27; in <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_45\">Article 20(3) -</a> i.e. whether the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_114\">                              109</span>\n\f     protection is available only to persons who are formally\n\n     accused in criminal cases, or does it extend to include\n\n     suspects and witnesses as well as those who apprehend\n\n     incrimination   in   cases   other   than    the   one   being\n\n     investigated?\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_76\">  7 Thirdly, we must evaluate the evidentiary value of\n\n     independent materials that are subsequently discovered\n\n     with the help of the test results.

Therefore, we have to\n     base our conclusion not merely upon <a href=\"/doc/357596/\" id=\"a_61\">Section 161(2)</a> but\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_120\">                              112</span>\n\f     on the more fundamental protection, although equal in\n     ambit, contained in <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_62\">Article 20(3).&quot;</a>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_148\">                                               (at p. 435)\n\n     &quot;If the police can interrogate to the point of self-\n     accusation, the subsequent exclusion of that evidence at\n     the trial hardly helps because the harm has already been\n     done. The police will prove through other evidence what\n     they have procured through forced confession. So it is\n     that the foresight of the framers has pre-empted self-\n     incrimination at the incipient stages by not expressly\n     restricting it to the trial stage in court. True, compelled\n     testimony previously obtained is excluded. But the\n     preventive blow falls also on pre-court testimonial\n     compulsion. The condition, as the decisions now go, is\n     that the person compelled must be an accused. Both\n     precedent procurement and subsequent exhibition of\n     self-incriminating testimony are obviated by intelligent\n     constitutional anticipation.&quot;                     (at p. 449)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_149\">103. In upholding this broad view of <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_63\">Article 20(3)</a>, V.R.\n\nKrishna Iyer, J. relied heavily on the decision of the US\n\nSupreme Court in Ernesto Miranda v. Arizona, 384 US 436\n\n(1966). The majority opinion (by Earl Warren, C.J.) laid down\n\nthat custodial statements could not be used as evidence\n\nunless the police officers had administered warnings about the\n\naccused&#x27;s right to remain silent. The decision also recognised\n\nthe right to consult a lawyer prior to and during the course of\n\ncustodial interrogations. The practice promoted by this case is\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_121\">                               113</span>\n\fthat it is only after a person has `knowingly and intelligently&#x27;\n\nwaived of these rights after receiving a warning that the\n\nstatements made thereafter can be admitted as evidence. The\n\nsafeguards were prescribed in the following manner, Id. at pp.\n\n444-445:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_82\">     &quot;... the prosecution may not use statements, whether\n     exculpatory or inculpatory, stemming from custodial\n     interrogation of the defendant unless it demonstrates the\n     use of procedural safeguards effective to secure the\n     privilege against self-incrimination. By custodial\n     interrogation, we mean questioning initiated by law\n     enforcement officers after a person has been taken into\n     custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in\n     any significant way. [...] As for the procedural safeguards\n     to be employed, unless other fully effective means are\n     devised to inform accused persons of their right of silence\n     and to assure a continuous opportunity to exercise it, the\n     following measures are required. Prior to any\n     questioning, the person must be warned that he has a\n     right to remain silent, that any statement he does make\n     may be used as evidence against him, and that he has a\n     right to the presence of an attorney, either retained or\n     appointed. The defendant may waive effectuation of these\n     rights, provided the waiver is made voluntarily,\n     knowingly and intelligently. If, however, he indicates in\n     any manner and at any stage of the process that he\n     wishes to consult with an attorney before speaking there\n     can be no questioning. Likewise, if the individual is alone\n     and indicates in any manner that he does not wish to be\n     interrogated, the police may not question him. The mere\n     fact that he may have answered some questions or\n     volunteered some statements on his own does not deprive\n     him of the right to refrain from answering any further\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_122\">                              114</span>\n\f       inquiries until he has consulted with an attorney and\n       thereafter consents to be questioned.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_150\">104.    These   safeguards   were     designed   to   mitigate   the\n\ndisadvantages faced by a suspect in a custodial environment.\n\nThis was done in recognition of the fact that methods involving\n\ndeception and psychological pressure were routinely used and\n\noften encouraged in police interrogations. Emphasis was\n\nplaced on the ability of the person being questioned to fully\n\ncomprehend and understand the content of the stipulated\n\nwarning. It was held, Id. at pp. 457-458:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_83\">       &quot;In these cases, we might not find the defendant&#x27;s\n       statements to have been involuntary in traditional terms.\n       Our concern for adequate safeguards to protect the\n       precious Fifth Amendment right is, of course, not\n       lessened in the slightest. In each of the cases, the\n       defendant was thrust into an unfamiliar atmosphere and\n       run through menacing police interrogation procedures. ...\n       It is obvious that such an interrogation environment is\n       created for no purpose other than to subjugate the\n       individual to the will of his examiner. This atmosphere\n       carried its own badge of intimidation. To be sure, this is\n       not physical intimidation, but it is equally destructive of\n       human dignity. [Professor Sutherland, `Crime and\n       Confessions&#x27;, 79 Harvard Law Review 21, 37 (1965)] The\n       current practice of incommunicado interrogation is at\n       odds with one of our Nation&#x27;s most cherished principles -\n       that the individual may not be compelled to incriminate\n       himself. Unless adequate protective devices are employed\n       to dispel the compulsion inherent in custodial\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_123\">                                115</span>\n\f     surroundings, no statement obtained from the defendant\n     can truly be the product of his free choice.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_151\">105. The opinion also explained the significance of having a\n\ncounsel present during a custodial interrogation. It was noted,\n\nId. at pp. 469-470:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_84\">     &quot;The circumstances surrounding in-custody interrogation\n     can operate very quickly to overbear the will of one\n     merely made aware of his privilege by his interrogators.\n     Therefore, the right to have counsel present at the\n     interrogation is indispensable to the protection of the\n     Fifth Amendment privilege under the system we delineate\n     today. Our aim is to assure that the individual&#x27;s right to\n     choose between silence and speech remains unfettered\n     throughout the interrogation process. A once-stated\n     warning, delivered by those who will conduct the\n     interrogation, cannot itself suffice to that end among\n     those who most require knowledge of their rights. A mere\n     warning given by the interrogators is not alone sufficient\n     to accomplish that end. Prosecutors themselves claim\n     that the admonishment of the right to remain silent\n     without more `will benefit only the recidivist and the\n     professional.&#x27; [Brief for the National District Attorneys\n     Association as amicus curiae, p. 14] Even preliminary\n     advice given to the accused by his own attorney can be\n     swiftly overcome by the secret interrogation process.\n     [Cited from Escobedo v. State of Illinois, 378 U.S. 478,\n     485 ...] Thus, the need for counsel to protect the Fifth\n     Amendment privilege comprehends not merely a right to\n     consult with counsel prior to questioning, but also to\n     have counsel present during any questioning if the\n     defendant so desires.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_124\">                              116</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_152\">\f106. The majority decision in Miranda (supra.) was not a\n\nsudden development in U.S. constitutional law. The scope of\n\nthe privilege against self-incrimination had been progressively\n\nexpanded in several prior decisions. The notable feature was\n\nthe recognition of the interrelationship between the Fifth\n\nAmendment and the Fourteenth Amendment&#x27;s guarantee that\n\nthe government must observe the `due process of law&#x27; as well\n\nas the Fourth Amendment&#x27;s protection against `unreasonable\n\nsearch and seizure&#x27;. While it is not necessary for us to survey\n\nthese decisions, it will suffice to say that after Miranda\n\n(supra.), administering a warning about a person&#x27;s right to\n\nsilence during custodial interrogations as well as obtaining a\n\nvoluntary waiver of the prescribed rights has become a\n\nubiquitous feature in the U.S. criminal justice system. In the\n\nabsence of such a warning and voluntary waiver, there is a\n\npresumption of compulsion with regard to the custodial\n\nstatements, thereby rendering them inadmissible as evidence.\n\nThe position in India is different since there is no automatic\n\npresumption of compulsion in respect of custodial statements.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_125\">                              117</span>\n\fHowever, if the fact of compulsion is proved then the resulting\n\nstatements are rendered inadmissible as evidence.\n\n\n\nWho can invoke the protection of <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_64\">Article 20(3)?</a>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_153\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1938988\" id=\"span_126\">107.

While there is a requirement of formal accusation for a\n\nperson to invoke <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_70\">Article 20(3)</a> it must be noted that the\n\nprotection contemplated by <a href=\"/doc/1110422/\" id=\"a_71\">Section 161(2)</a>, CrPC is wider.\n\n<a href=\"/doc/357596/\" id=\"a_72\">Section 161(2)</a> read with 161(1) protects `any person supposed\n\nto be acquainted with the facts and circumstances of the case&#x27;\n\nin the course of examination by the police.

Therefore the `right against self-incrimination&#x27; protects\n\npersons who have been formally accused as well as those who\n\nare examined as suspects in criminal cases. It also extends to\n\ncover witnesses who apprehend that their answers could\n\nexpose them to criminal charges in the ongoing investigation\n\nor even in cases other than the one being investigated.\n\nKrishna Iyer, J. clarified this position, (1978) 2 SCC 424, at p.\n\n435:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_89\">       &quot;The learned Advocate General, influenced by American\n       decisions rightly agreed that in expression <a href=\"/doc/357596/\" id=\"a_73\">Section 161(2)</a>\n       of the Code might cover not merely accusations already\n       registered in police stations but those which are likely to\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_130\">                                119</span>\n\f     be the basis for exposing a person to a criminal charge.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_90\">     Indeed, this wider construction, if applicable to <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_74\">Article\n     20(3)</a>, approximates the constitutional clause to the\n     explicit statement of the prohibition in <a href=\"/doc/357596/\" id=\"a_75\">Section 161(2)</a>.\n     This latter provision meaningfully uses the expression\n     `expose himself to a criminal charge&#x27;. Obviously, these\n     words mean, not only cases where the person is already\n     exposed to a criminal charge but also instances which\n     will imminently expose him to criminal charges.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_157\">It was further observed, Id. at pp. 451-452 (Para. 50):\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_91\">     &quot;... `To be a witness against oneself&#x27; is not confined to the\n     particular offence regarding which the questioning is\n     made but extends to other offences about which the\n     accused has reasonable apprehension of implication from\n     his answer. This conclusion also flows from `tendency to\n     be exposed to a criminal charge&#x27;. A `criminal charge&#x27;\n     covers any criminal charge then under investigation or\n     trial or which imminently threatens the accused.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_158\">110. Even though <a href=\"/doc/1110422/\" id=\"a_76\">Section 161(2)</a> of the CrPC casts a wide\n\nprotective net to protect the formally accused persons as well\n\nas suspects and witnesses during the investigative stage,\n\n<a href=\"/doc/921930/\" id=\"a_77\">Section 132</a> of the Evidence Act limits the applicability of this\n\nprotection to witnesses during the trial stage. The latter\n\nprovision provides that witnesses cannot refuse to answer\n\nquestions during a trial on the ground that the answers could\n\nincriminate them. However, the proviso to this section\n\nstipulates that the content of such answers cannot expose the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_131\">                               120</span>\n\fwitness to arrest or prosecution, except for a prosecution for\n\ngiving false evidence. Therefore, the protection accorded to\n\nwitnesses at the stage of trial is not as wide as the one\n\naccorded to the accused, suspects and witnesses during\n\ninvestigation [under <a href=\"/doc/1110422/\" id=\"a_78\">Section 161(2)</a>, CrPC]. Furthermore, it is\n\nnarrower than the protection given to the accused during the\n\ntrial stage [under Section 313(3) and Proviso (b) to <a href=\"/doc/3809/\" id=\"a_79\">Section\n\n315(1)</a>, CrPC]. The legislative intent is to preserve the fact-\n\nfinding function of a criminal trial. <a href=\"/doc/921930/\" id=\"a_80\">Section 132</a> of the Evidence\n\nAct reads:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_92\">     &quot;132.

Since    the    extension     of    the    `right   against   self-\n\nincrimination&#x27; to suspects and witnesses has its basis in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1110422/\" id=\"a_81\">Section 161(2)</a>, CrPC it is not readily available to persons who\n\nare examined during proceedings that are not governed by the\n\ncode. There is a distinction between proceedings of a purely\n\ncriminal nature and those proceedings which can culminate in\n\npunitive remedies and yet cannot be characterised as criminal\n\nproceedings. The consistent position has been that ordinarily\n\n<a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_82\">Article    20(3)</a>    cannot    be      invoked       by   witnesses    during\n\nproceedings        that   cannot      be     characterised     as    criminal\n\nproceedings.         In     administrative          and       quasi-criminal\n\nproceedings, the protection of <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_83\">Article 20(3)</a> becomes available\n\nonly after a person has been formally accused of committing\n\nan offence. For instance in <a href=\"/doc/693505/\" id=\"a_84\">Raja Narayanlal Bansilal v.\n\nManeck Phiroz Mistry</a>, [1961] 1 SCR 417, the contention\n\nrelated to the admissibility of a statement made before an\n\ninspector who was appointed under the <a href=\"/doc/153279772/\" id=\"a_85\">Companies Act, 1923</a>\n\nto investigate the affairs of a company and report thereon.

At the\n     commencement of the enquiry and indeed throughout its\n     proceedings there is no accused person, no accuser, and\n     no accusation against anyone that he has committed an\n     offence. In our opinion a general enquiry and\n     investigation into the affairs of the company thus\n     contemplated cannot be regarded as an investigation\n     which starts with an accusation contemplated in <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_87\">Article\n     20(3)</a> of the Constitution. ...&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_160\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"690751\" id=\"span_135\">112.

In light of these observations, we must examine the\n\npermissibility of extracting statements which may furnish a\n\nlink in the chain of evidence and hence create a risk of\n\nexposure to criminal charges. The crucial question is whether\n\nsuch derivative use of information extracted in a custodial\n\nenvironment is compatible with <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_103\">Article 20(3).</a> It is a settled\n\nprinciple that statements made in custody are considered to\n\nbe unreliable unless they have been subjected to cross-\n\nexamination or judicial scrutiny. The scheme created by the\n\nCode of Criminal Procedure and the Indian Evidence Act also\n\nmandates that confessions made before police officers are\n\nordinarily not admissible as evidence and it is only the\n\nstatements made in the presence of a judicial magistrate\n\nwhich can be given weightage. The doctrine of excluding the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_145\">                              129</span>\n\f`fruits of a poisonous tree&#x27; has been incorporated in <a href=\"/doc/967059/\" id=\"a_104\">Sections\n\n24</a>, <a href=\"/doc/494844/\" id=\"a_105\">25</a> and <a href=\"/doc/387768/\" id=\"a_106\">26</a> of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 which read as\n\nfollows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_105\">     24.

We have already referred to the language of <a href=\"/doc/447673/\" id=\"a_107\">Section 161</a>,\n\nCrPC which protects the accused as well as suspects and\n\nwitnesses who are examined during the course of investigation\n\nin a criminal case. It would also be useful to refer to <a href=\"/doc/721655/\" id=\"a_108\">Sections\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_146\">                              130</span></a>\n\f<a href=\"/doc/523607/\" id=\"a_109\">162</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1184284/\" id=\"a_110\">163</a> and <a href=\"/doc/497457/\" id=\"a_111\">164</a> of the CrPC which lay down procedural\n\nsafeguards in respect of statements made by persons during\n\nthe course of investigation. However, <a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_112\">Section 27</a> of the\n\nEvidence Act incorporates the `theory of confirmation by\n\nsubsequent facts&#x27; - i.e. statements made in custody are\n\nadmissible to the extent that they can be proved by the\n\nsubsequent discovery of facts. It is quite possible that the\n\ncontent of the custodial statements could directly lead to the\n\nsubsequent discovery of relevant facts rather than their\n\ndiscovery through independent means. Hence such statements\n\ncould also be described as those which `furnish a link in the\n\nchain of evidence&#x27; needed for a successful prosecution. This\n\nprovision reads as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_108\">     27. How much of information received from accused\n     may be proved. - Provided that, when any fact is\n     deposed to as discovered in consequence of information\n     received from a person accused of any offence, in the\n     custody of a police officer, so much of such information,\n     whether it amounts to a confession or not, as relates\n     distinctly to the fact thereby discovered, may be proved.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_176\">120. This provision permits the derivative use of custodial\n\nstatements in the ordinary course of events. In Indian law,\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_147\">                              131</span>\n\fthere     is   no   automatic   presumption   that   the   custodial\n\nstatements have been extracted through compulsion. In short,\n\nthere is no requirement of additional diligence akin to the\n\nadministration        of   Miranda      warnings.    However,     in\n\ncircumstances where it is shown that a person was indeed\n\ncompelled to make statements while in custody, relying on\n\nsuch testimony as well as its derivative use will offend <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_113\">Article\n\n20(3).</a> The relationship between <a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_114\">Section 27</a> of the Evidence Act\n\nand <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_115\">Article 20(3)</a> of the Constitution was clarified in Kathi\n\nKalu Oghad (supra.). It was observed in the majority opinion\n\nby Jagannadhadas, J., at pp. 33-34:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_109\">        &quot;The information given by an accused person to a police\n        officer leading to the discovery of a fact which may or\n        may not prove incriminatory has been made admissible\n        in evidence by that Section. If it is not incriminatory of\n        the person giving the information, the question does not\n        arise. It can arise only when it is of an incriminatory\n        character so far as the giver of the information is\n        concerned. If the self-incriminatory information has been\n        given by an accused person without any threat, that will\n        be admissible in evidence and that will not be hit by the\n        provisions of cl. (3) of <a href=\"/doc/655638/\" id=\"a_116\">Art. 20</a> of the Constitution for the\n        reason that there has been no compulsion. It must,\n        therefore, be held that the provisions of<a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_117\"> s. 27</a> of the\n        Evidence Act are not within the prohibition aforesaid,\n        unless compulsion has been used in obtaining the\n        information.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_177\">                                              (emphasis supplied)\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_148\">                                  132</span>\n\fThis position was made amply clear at pp. 35-36:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_110\">     &quot;Hence, the mere fact that the accused person, when he\n     made the statement in question was in police custody\n     would not, by itself, be the foundation for an inference of\n     law that the accused was compelled to make the\n     statement. Of course, it is open to an accused person to\n     show that while he was in police custody at the relevant\n     time, he was subjected to treatment which, in the\n     circumstances of the case, would lend itself to the\n     inference that compulsion was, in fact, exercised. In\n     other words, it will be a question of fact in each case to\n     be determined by the Court on weighing the facts and\n     circumstances disclosed in the evidence before it.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_178\">121. The minority opinion also agreed with the majority&#x27;s\n\nconclusion on this point since Das Gupta, J., held at p. 47:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_111\">     &quot;<a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_118\">Section 27</a> provides that when any fact is deposed to as\n     discovered in consequence of information received from a\n     person accused of any offence, in the custody of a police\n     officer, so much of the information, whether it amounts\n     to a confession or not, as relates distinctly to the fact\n     thereby discovered, may be proved. It cannot be disputed\n     that by giving such information the accused furnishes\n     evidence, and therefore is a `witness&#x27; during the\n     investigation. Unless, however he is `compelled&#x27; to give\n     the information he cannot be said to be `compelled&#x27; to be\n     a witness; and so <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_119\">Article 20(3)</a> is not infringed.\n     Compulsion is not however inherent in the receipt of\n     information from an accused person in the custody of a\n     police officer. There may be cases where an accused in\n     custody is compelled to give the information later on\n     sought to be proved under<a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_120\"> s. 27</a>. There will be other\n     cases where the accused gives the information without\n     any compulsion. Where the accused is compelled to give\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_149\">                              133</span>\n\f        information it will be an infringement of <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_121\">Art. 20(3);</a> but\n        there is no such infringement where he gives the\n        information without any compulsion. ...&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_179\">122. We must also address another line of reasoning which\n\nwas adopted in one of the impugned judgments. It was stated\n\nthat the exclusionary rule in evidence law is applicable to\n\nstatements that are inculpatory in nature. Based on this\n\npremise, it was observed that at the time of administering the\n\nimpugned tests, it cannot be ascertained whether the resulting\n\nrevelations or inferences will prove to be inculpatory or\n\nexculpatory in due course. Taking this reasoning forward, it\n\nwas held that the compulsory administration of the impugned\n\ntests    should be    permissible     since   the   same   does   not\n\nnecessarily lead to the extraction of inculpatory evidence. We\n\nare unable to agree with this reasoning.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_180\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_181\">123. The distinction between inculpatory and exculpatory\n\nevidence gathered during investigation is relevant for deciding\n\nwhat will be admissible as evidence during the trial stage. The\n\nexclusionary rule in evidence law mandates that if inculpatory\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_150\">                                134</span>\n\fevidence has been gathered through improper methods\n\n(involving coercion, threat or inducement among others) then\n\nthe same should be excluded from the trial, while there is no\n\nsuch prohibition on the consideration of exculpatory evidence.\n\nHowever, this distinction between the treatment of inculpatory\n\nand exculpatory evidence is made retrospectively at the trial\n\nstage and it cannot be extended back to the stage of\n\ninvestigation. If we were to permit the admission of involuntary\n\nstatement on the ground that at the time of asking a question\n\nit is not known whether the answer will be inculpatory or\n\nexculpatory, the `right against self-incrimination&#x27; will be\n\nrendered meaningless. The law confers on `any person&#x27; who is\n\nexamined during an investigation, an effective choice between\n\nspeaking and remaining silent. This implies that it is for the\n\nperson being examined to decide whether the answer to a\n\nparticular question will eventually prove to be inculpatory or\n\nexculpatory. Furthermore, it is also likely that the information\n\nor materials collected at an earlier stage of investigation can\n\nprove to be inculpatory in due course.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_182\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_151\">                              135</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_183\">\f124. However, it is conceivable that in some circumstances the\n\ntestimony extracted through compulsion may not actually lead\n\nto exposure to criminal charges or penalties. For example this\n\nis a possibility when the investigators make an offer of\n\nimmunity    against    the    direct     use,   derivative   use   or\n\ntransactional use of the testimony. Immunity against direct\n\nuse entails that a witness will not be prosecuted on the basis\n\nof the statements made to the investigators. A protection\n\nagainst derivative use implies that a person will not be\n\nprosecuted on the basis of the fruits of such testimony.\n\nImmunity against transactional use will shield a witness from\n\ncriminal   charges    in   cases     other   than   the   one   being\n\ninvestigated. It is of course entirely up to the investigating\n\nagencies to decide whether to offer immunity and in what\n\nform. Even though this is distinctly possible, it is difficult to\n\nconceive of such a situation in the context of the present case.\n\nA person who is given an offer of immunity against\n\nprosecution is far more likely to voluntarily cooperate with the\n\ninvestigation efforts. This could be in the form of giving\n\ntestimony or helping in the discovery of material evidence. If a\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_152\">                                   136</span>\n\fperson is freely willing to cooperate with the investigation\n\nefforts, it would be redundant to compel such a person to\n\nundergo the impugned tests. If reliance on such tests is\n\nsought for refreshing a cooperating witness&#x27; memory, the\n\nperson will in all probability give his/her consent to undergo\n\nthese tests.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_184\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_185\">125. It could be argued that the compulsory administration of\n\nthe impugned tests can prove to be useful in instances where\n\nthe cooperating witness has difficulty in remembering the\n\nrelevant facts or is wilfully concealing crucial details. Such\n\nsituations could very well arise when a person who is a co-\n\naccused is offered immunity from prosecution in return for\n\ncooperating with the investigators. Even though the right\n\nagainst self-incrimination is not directly applicable in such\n\nsituations,    the   relevant   legal   inquiry   is   whether   the\n\ncompulsory administration of the impugned tests meets the\n\nrequisite standard of `substantive due process&#x27; for placing\n\nrestraints on personal liberty.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_186\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_153\">                                  137</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_187\">\f126. At this juncture, it must be reiterated that Indian law\n\nincorporates the `rule against adverse inferences from silence&#x27;\n\nwhich is operative at the trial stage. As mentioned earlier, this\n\nposition is embodied in a conjunctive reading of <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_122\">Article 20(3)</a> of\n\nthe Constitution and <a href=\"/doc/357596/\" id=\"a_123\">Sections 161(2)</a>, 313(3) and Proviso (b) of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/3809/\" id=\"a_124\">Section 315(1)</a> of the CrPC. The gist of this position is that\n\neven though an accused is a competent witness in his/her\n\nown trial, he/she cannot be compelled to answer questions\n\nthat could expose him/her to incrimination and the trial judge\n\ncannot draw adverse inferences from the refusal to do so. This\n\nposition is cemented by prohibiting any of the parties from\n\ncommenting on the failure of the accused to give evidence.\n\nThis rule was lucidly explained in the English case of\n\nWoolmington v. DPP, (1935) AC 462, at p. 481:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_112\">     &quot;The `right to silence&#x27; is a principle of common law and it\n     means that normally courts or tribunals of fact should\n     not be invited or encouraged to conclude, by parties or\n     prosecutors, that a suspect or an accused is guilty\n     merely because he has refused to respond to questions\n     put to him by the police or by the Court.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_188\">127. The 180th Report of the Law Commission of India (May\n\n2002) dealt with this very issue. It considered arguments for\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_154\">                               138</span>\n\fdiluting the `rule against adverse inferences from silence&#x27;.\n\nApart from surveying several foreign statutes and decisions,\n\nthe report took note of the fact that Section 342(2) of the\n\nerstwhile <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_125\">Code of Criminal Procedure</a>, 1898 permitted the trial\n\njudge to draw an inference from the silence of the accused.\n\nHowever, this position was changed with the enactment of the\n\nnew <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_126\">Code of Criminal Procedure</a> in 1973, thereby prohibiting\n\nthe making of comments as well as the drawing of inferences\n\nfrom the fact of an accused&#x27;s silence. In light of this, the report\n\nconcluded:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_113\">     &quot;... We have reviewed the law in other countries as well\n     as in India for the purpose of examining whether any\n     amendments are necessary in the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_127\">Code of Criminal\n     Procedure</a>, 1973. On a review, we find that no changes in\n     the law relating to silence of the accused are necessary\n     and if made, they will be ultra vires of <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_128\">Article 20(3)</a> and\n     <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_129\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India. We recommend\n     accordingly.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_189\">128. Some commentators have argued that the `rule against\n\nadverse inferences from silence&#x27; should be broadly construed\n\nin order to give protection against non-penal consequences. It\n\nis reasoned that the fact of a person&#x27;s refusal to answer\n\nquestions should not be held against him/her in a wide variety\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_155\">                                139</span>\n\fof settings, including those outside the context of criminal\n\ntrials. A hypothetical illustration of such a setting is a\n\ndeportation hearing where an illegal immigrant could be\n\ndeported following a refusal to answer questions or furnish\n\nmaterials required by the concerned authorities. This question\n\nis relevant for the present case because a person who refuses\n\nto undergo the impugned tests during the investigative stage\n\ncould face non-penal consequences which lie outside the\n\nprotective scope of <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_130\">Article 20(3).</a> For example, a person who\n\nrefuses to undergo these tests could face the risk of custodial\n\nviolence,   increased   police    surveillance   or   harassment\n\nthereafter. Even a person who is compelled to undergo these\n\ntests could face such adverse consequences on account of the\n\ncontents of the test results if they heighten the investigators&#x27;\n\nsuspicions. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"162242\" id=\"span_156\">Each of these consequences, though condemnable,\n\nfall short of the requisite standard of `exposure to criminal\n\ncharges and penalties&#x27; that has been enumerated in <a href=\"/doc/1110422/\" id=\"a_131\">Section\n\n161(2)</a> of the CrPC. Even though <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_132\">Article 20(3)</a> will not be\n\napplicable in such circumstances, reliance can be placed on\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_133\">Article 21</a> if such non-penal consequences amount to a\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_157\">                                 140</span>\n\fviolation of `personal liberty&#x27; as contemplated under the\n\nConstitution. In the past, this Court has recognised the rights\n\nof prisoners (undertrials as well as convicts) as well as\n\nindividuals in other custodial environments to receive `fair,\n\njust and equitable&#x27; treatment. For instance in <a href=\"/doc/162242/\" id=\"a_134\">Sunil Batra v.\n\nDelhi Administration</a>, (1978) 4 SCC 494, it was decided that\n\npractices such as `solitary confinement&#x27; and the use of bar-\n\nfetters in jails were violative of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_135\">Article 21.</a> Hence, in\n\ncircumstances where persons who refuse to answer questions\n\nduring   the   investigative   stage   are   exposed   to   adverse\n\nconsequences of a non-penal nature, the inquiry should\n\naccount for the expansive scope of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_136\">Article 21</a> rather than the\n\nright contemplated by <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_137\">Article 20(3).</a></span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_190\">\n\nI-B. Whether the results derived from the impugned\n\ntechniques amount to `testimonial compulsion&#x27; thereby\n\nattracting the bar of <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_138\">Article 20(3)?</a>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_191\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_192\">129. The next issue is whether the results gathered from the\n\nimpugned tests amount to `testimonial compulsion&#x27;, thereby\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_158\">                                141</span>\n\fattracting the prohibition of <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_139\">Article 20(3).</a> For this purpose, it\n\nis necessary to survey the precedents which deal with what\n\nconstitutes `testimonial compulsion&#x27; and how testimonial acts\n\nare distinguished from the collection of physical evidence.\n\nApart from the apparent distinction between evidence of a\n\ntestimonial and physical nature, some forms of testimonial\n\nacts lie outside the scope of <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_140\">Article 20(3).</a> For instance, even\n\nthough   acts   such   as      compulsorily   obtaining   specimen\n\nsignatures and handwriting samples are testimonial in nature,\n\nthey are not incriminating by themselves if they are used for\n\nthe purpose of identification or corroboration with facts or\n\nmaterials that the investigators are already acquainted with.\n\nThe relevant consideration for extending the protection of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_141\">Article 20(3)</a> is whether the materials are likely to lead to\n\nincrimination by themselves or `furnish a link in the chain of\n\nevidence&#x27; which could lead to the same result. Hence, reliance\n\non the contents of compelled testimony comes within the\n\nprohibition of <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_142\">Article 20(3)</a> but its use for the purpose of\n\nidentification or corroboration with facts already known to the\n\ninvestigators is not barred.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_193\">\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_159\">                                 142</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_194\">\f130. It is quite evident that the narcoanalysis technique\n\ninvolves a testimonial act. A subject is encouraged to speak in\n\na drug-induced state, and there is no reason why such an act\n\nshould be treated any differently from verbal answers during\n\nan ordinary interrogation. In one of the impugned judgments,\n\nthe compulsory administration of the narcoanalysis technique\n\nwas defended on the ground that at the time of conducting the\n\ntest, it is not known whether the results will eventually prove\n\nto be inculpatory or exculpatory. We have already rejected this\n\nreasoning. We see no other obstruction to the proposition that\n\nthe compulsory administration of the narcoanalysis technique\n\namounts to `testimonial compulsion&#x27; and thereby triggers the\n\nprotection of <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_143\">Article 20(3).</a>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_195\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_196\">131. However, an unresolved question is whether the results\n\nobtained through polygraph examination and the BEAP test\n\nare of a testimonial nature. In both these tests, inferences are\n\ndrawn from the physiological responses of the subject and no\n\ndirect reliance is placed on verbal responses. In some forms of\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_160\">                               143</span>\n\fpolygraph examination, the subject may be required to offer\n\nverbal answers such as `Yes&#x27; or `No&#x27;, but the results are based\n\non the measurement of changes in several physiological\n\ncharacteristics rather than these verbal responses. In the\n\nBEAP test, the subject is not required to give any verbal\n\nresponses   at    all   and   inferences     are   drawn   from   the\n\nmeasurement of electrical activity in the brain. In the\n\nimpugned judgments, it has been held that the results\n\nobtained from both the Polygraph examination and the BEAP\n\ntest do not amount to `testimony&#x27; thereby lying outside the\n\nprotective scope of <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_144\">Article 20(3).</a> The same assertion has been\n\nreiterated before us by the counsel for the respondents. In\n\norder to evaluate this position, we must examine the contours\n\nof the expression `testimonial compulsion&#x27;.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_197\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1306519\" id=\"span_161\">132. The question of what constitutes `testimonial compulsion&#x27;\n\nfor the purpose of <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_145\">Article 20(3)</a> was addressed in <a href=\"/doc/1306519/\" id=\"a_146\">M.P.\n\nSharma</a>&#x27;s case (supra.). In that case, the Court considered\n\nwhether the issuance of search warrants in the course of an\n\ninvestigation    into   the   affairs   of   a   company   (following\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_162\">                                  144</span>\n\fallegations of misappropriation and embezzlement) amounted\n\nto an infringement of <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_147\">Article 20(3).</a> The search warrants issued\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/850208/\" id=\"a_148\">Section 96</a> of the erstwhile <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_149\">Code of Criminal Procedure</a>,\n\n1898 authorised the investigating agencies to search the\n\npremises and seize the documents maintained by the said\n\ncompany.    The    relevant    observations    were    made     by\n\nJagannadhadas, J., at pp. 1087-1088:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_114\">     &quot; ... The phrase used in <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_150\">Article 20(3)</a> is `to be a witness&#x27;. A\n     person can `be a witness&#x27; not merely by giving oral\n     evidence but also by producing documents or making\n     intelligible gestures as in the case of a dumb witness [see\n     <a href=\"/doc/211471/\" id=\"a_151\">Section 119</a> of the Evidence Act or the like]. `To be a\n     witness&#x27; is nothing more than `to furnish evidence&#x27;, and\n     such evidence can be furnished through the lips or by\n     production of a thing or of a document or in other modes.\n     ...\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_115\">     Indeed, every positive volitional act which furnishes\n     evidence is testimony, and testimonial compulsion\n     connotes coercion which procures the positive volitional\n     evidentiary acts of the person, as opposed to the negative\n     attitude of silence or submission on his part. ...&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_198\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"1626264\" id=\"span_163\">133. These observations suggest that the phrase `to be a\n\nwitness&#x27; is not confined to oral testimony for the purpose of\n\ninvoking <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_152\">Article 20(3)</a> and that it includes certain non-verbal\n\nforms of conduct such as the production of documents and\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_164\">                               145</span>\n\fthe making of intelligible gestures. However, in <a href=\"/doc/1626264/\" id=\"a_153\">Kathi Kalu\n\nOghad</a> (supra.), there was a disagreement between the\n\nmajority and minority opinions on whether the expression `to\n\nbe a witness&#x27; was the same as `to furnish evidence&#x27;. In that\n\ncase, this Court had examined whether certain statutory\n\nprovisions, namely - <a href=\"/doc/770022/\" id=\"a_154\">Section 73</a> of the Evidence Act, <a href=\"/doc/1391184/\" id=\"a_155\">Sections 5</a>\n\nand <a href=\"/doc/1675084/\" id=\"a_156\">6</a> of the Identification of Prisoners Act, 1920 and <a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_157\">Section\n\n27</a> of the Evidence Act were compatible with <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_158\">Article 20(3).</a>\n\n<a href=\"/doc/770022/\" id=\"a_159\">Section 73</a> of the Evidence Act empowered courts to obtain\n\nspecimen handwriting or signatures and finger impressions of\n\nan accused person for purposes of comparison. <a href=\"/doc/1391184/\" id=\"a_160\">Sections 5</a> and\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1675084/\" id=\"a_161\">6</a> of the Identification of Prisoners Act empowered a Magistrate\n\nto obtain the photograph or measurements of an accused\n\nperson. In respect of <a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_162\">Section 27</a> of the Evidence Act, there was\n\nan agreement between the majority and the minority opinions\n\nthat the use of compulsion to extract custodial statements\n\namounts to an exception to the `theory of confirmation by\n\nsubsequent facts&#x27;. We have already referred to the relevant\n\nobservations in an earlier part of this opinion. Both the\n\nmajority and minority opinions ruled that the other statutory\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_165\">                              146</span>\n\fprovisions mentioned above were compatible with <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_163\">Article 20(3)</a>,\n\nbut adopted different approaches to arrive at this conclusion.\n\nIn the majority opinion it was held that the ambit of the\n\nexpression `to be a witness&#x27; was narrower than that of\n\n`furnishing evidence&#x27;. B.P. Sinha, C.J. observed, [1962] 3 SCR\n\n10, at pp. 29-32:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_116\">     &quot; `To be a witness&#x27; may be equivalent to `furnishing\n     evidence&#x27; in the sense of making oral or written\n     statements, but not in the larger sense of the expression\n     so as to include giving of thumb impression or\n     impression of palm or foot or fingers or specimen writing\n     or exposing a part of the body by an accused person for\n     purpose of identification. `Furnishing evidence&#x27; in the\n     latter sense could not have been within the\n     contemplation of the Constitution-makers for the simple\n     reason that - though they may have intended to protect\n     an accused person from the hazards of self-\n     incrimination, in the light of the English Law on the\n     subject - they could not have intended to put obstacles in\n     the way of efficient and effective investigation into crime\n     and of bringing criminals to justice. The taking of\n     impressions or parts of the body of an accused person\n     very often becomes necessary to help the investigation of\n     a crime. It is as much necessary to protect an accused\n     person against being compelled to incriminate himself, as\n     to arm the agents of law and the law courts with\n     legitimate powers to bring offenders to justice.\n     Furthermore it must be assumed that the Constitution-\n     makers were aware of the existing law, for example,\n     <a href=\"/doc/770022/\" id=\"a_164\">Section 73</a> of the Evidence Act or <a href=\"/doc/1391184/\" id=\"a_165\">Section 5</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1675084/\" id=\"a_166\">6</a> of the\n     Identification of Prisoners Act (XXXIII of 1920).\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_166\">                              147</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_117\">\f<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1306519\" id=\"span_167\">... The giving of finger impression or of specimen\nsignature or of handwriting, strictly speaking, is not `to\nbe a witness&#x27;. `To be a witness&#x27; means imparting\nknowledge in respect of relevant fact, by means of oral\nstatements or statements in writing, by a person who has\npersonal knowledge of the facts to be communicated to a\ncourt or to a person holding an enquiry or investigation.\nA person is said `to be a witness&#x27; to a certain state of facts\nwhich has to be determined by a court or authority\nauthorised to come to a decision, by testifying to what he\nhas seen, or something he has heard which is capable of\nbeing heard and is not hit by the rule excluding hearsay\nor giving his opinion, as an expert, in respect of matters\nin controversy. Evidence has been classified by text\nwriters into three categories, namely, (1) oral testimony;\n(2) evidence furnished by documents; and (3) material\nevidence. We have already indicated that we are in\nagreement with the Full Court decision in <a href=\"/doc/1306519/\" id=\"a_167\">Sharma</a>&#x27;s case,\n[1954] SCR 1077, that the prohibition in cl. (3) of <a href=\"/doc/655638/\" id=\"a_168\">Art. 20</a>\ncovers not only oral testimony given by a person accused\nof an offence but also his written statements which may\nhave a bearing on the controversy with reference to the\ncharge against him. ...</span>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_199\">... Self-incrimination must mean conveying information\nbased upon the personal knowledge of the person giving\nthe information and cannot include merely the\nmechanical process of producing documents in court\nwhich may throw a light on any of the points in\ncontroversy, but which do not contain any statement of\nthe accused based on his personal knowledge. For\nexample, the accused person may be in possession of a\ndocument which is in his writing or which contains his\nsignature or his thumb impression. The production of\nsuch a document, with a view to comparison of the\nwriting or the signature or the impression, is not the\nstatement of an accused person, which can be said to be\nof the nature of a personal testimony. When an accused\nperson is called upon by the Court or any other authority\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_168\">                          148</span>\n\f     holding an investigation to give his finger impression or\n     signature or a specimen of his handwriting, he is not\n     giving any testimony of the nature of a `personal\n     testimony&#x27;. The giving of a `personal testimony&#x27; must\n     depend on his volition. He can make any kind of\n     statement or may refuse to make any statement. But his\n     finger impressions or his handwriting, in spite of efforts\n     at concealing the true nature of it by dissimulation\n     cannot change their intrinsic character. Thus, the giving\n     of finger impressions or of specimen writing or of\n     signatures by an accused person, though it may amount\n     to `furnishing evidence&#x27; in the larger sense, is not\n     included within the expression `to be a witness&#x27;.\n\n     In order that a testimony by an accused person may be\n     said to have been self-incriminatory, the compulsion of\n     which comes within the prohibition of the constitutional\n     provision, it must be of such a character that by itself it\n     should have the tendency of incriminating the accused, if\n     not also of actually doing so. In other words, it should be\n     a statement which makes the case against the accused\n     person atleast probable, considered by itself. A specimen\n     handwriting or signature or finger impressions by\n     themselves are no testimony at all, being wholly\n     innocuous because they are unchangeable except in rare\n     cases where the ridges of the fingers or the style of\n     writing have been tampered with. They are only materials\n     for comparison in order to lend assurance to the Court\n     that its inference based on other pieces of evidence is\n     reliable. They are neither oral nor documentary evidence\n     but belong to the third category of material evidence\n     which is outside the limit of `testimony&#x27;.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_200\">134. Hence, B.P. Sinha, C.J. construed the expression `to be a\n\nwitness&#x27; as one that was limited to oral or documentary\n\nevidence, while further confining the same to statements that\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_169\">                              149</span>\n\fcould lead to incrimination by themselves, as opposed to those\n\nused for the purpose of identification or comparison with facts\n\nalready known to the investigators. The minority opinion\n\nauthored by Das Gupta, J. (3 judges) took a different\n\napproach, which is evident from the following extracts, Id. at\n\npp. 40-43:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_118\">     &quot;That brings us to the suggestion that the expression `to\n     be a witness&#x27; must be limited to a statement whether oral\n     or in writing by an accused person imparting knowledge\n     of relevant facts; but that mere production of some\n     material evidence, whether documentary or otherwise\n     would not come within the ambit of this expression. This\n     suggestion has found favour with the majority of the\n     Bench, we think however that this is an unduly narrow\n     interpretation. We have to remind ourselves that while on\n     the one hand we should bear in mind that the\n     Constitution-makers could not have intended to stifle\n     legitimate modes of investigation we have to remember\n     further that quite clearly they thought that certain things\n     should not be allowed to be done, during the\n     investigation, or trial, however helpful they might seem to\n     be to the unfolding of truth and an unnecessary\n     apprehension of disaster to the police system and the\n     administration of justice, should not deter us from giving\n     the words their proper meaning.

By\n     themselves, these impressions or the handwritings do not\n     incriminate the accused person, or even tend to do so.\n     That is why it must be held that by giving these\n     impressions or specimen handwriting, the accused\n     person does not furnish evidence against himself. ...\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_123\">     ...

There is little risk, if at all, in the investigator or\n     the prosecutor being induced to lethargy or inaction\n     because he can get such handwriting or impressions\n     from an accused person. For, by themselves they are of\n     little or of no assistance to bring home the guilt of an\n     accused.

Since the majority decision in <a href=\"/doc/1626264/\" id=\"a_175\">Kathi Kalu Oghad</a>\n\n(supra.) is the controlling precedent, it will be useful to re-\n\nstate the two main premises for understanding the scope of\n\n`testimonial compulsion&#x27;. The first is that ordinarily it is the\n\noral   or   written   statements   which   convey   the   personal\n\nknowledge of a person in respect of relevant facts that amount\n\nto `personal testimony&#x27; thereby coming within the prohibition\n\ncontemplated by <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_176\">Article 20(3).</a> In most cases, such `personal\n\ntestimony&#x27; can be readily distinguished from material evidence\n\nsuch as bodily substances and other physical objects. The\n\nsecond premise is that in some cases, oral or written\n\nstatements can be relied upon but only for the purpose of\n\nidentification or comparison with facts and materials that are\n\nalready in the possession of the investigators. The bar of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_177\">Article 20(3)</a> can be invoked when the statements are likely to\n\nlead to incrimination by themselves or `furnish a link in the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_174\">                               153</span>\n\fchain of evidence&#x27; needed to do so. We must emphasize that a\n\nsituation where a testimonial response is used for comparison\n\nwith facts already known to investigators is inherently\n\ndifferent from a situation where a testimonial response helps\n\nthe investigators to subsequently discover fresh facts or\n\nmaterials that could be relevant to the ongoing investigation.</span>\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_203\">137. The recognition of the distinction between testimonial\n\nacts and physical evidence for the purpose of invoking <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_178\">Article\n\n20(3)</a> of the Constitution finds a close parallel in some foreign\n\ndecisions. In Armando Schmerber v. California, 384 US 757\n\n(1966), the U.S. Supreme Court had to determine whether an\n\ninvoluntary blood test of a defendant had violated the Fifth\n\nAmendment. The defendant was undergoing treatment at a\n\nhospital following an automobile accident. A blood sample was\n\ntaken against his will at the direction of a police officer.\n\nAnalysis of the same revealed that Schmerber had been\n\nintoxicated and these results were admitted into evidence,\n\nthereby leading to his conviction for drunk driving. An\n\nobjection was raised on the basis of the Fifth Amendment and\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_175\">                              154</span>\n\fthe majority opinion (Brennan, J.) relied on a distinction\n\nbetween evidence of a `testimonial&#x27; or `communicative&#x27; nature\n\nas opposed to evidence of a `physical&#x27; or `real nature&#x27;,\n\nconcluding that the privilege against self-incrimination applied\n\nto the former but not to the latter. In arriving at this decision,\n\nreference was made to several precedents with a prominent\n\none being United States v. Holt, 218 US 245 (1910). In that\n\ncase, a defendant was forced to try on an article of clothing\n\nduring the course of investigation. It had been ruled that the\n\nprivilege against self-incrimination prohibited the use of\n\ncompulsion to `extort communications&#x27; from the defendant,\n\nbut not the use of the defendant&#x27;s body as evidence.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_204\">138. In addition to citing John Wigmore&#x27;s position that `the\n\nprivilege is limited to testimonial disclosures&#x27; the Court in\n\nSchmerber also took note of other examples where it had been\n\nheld that the privilege did not apply to physical evidence,\n\nwhich included `compulsion to submit to fingerprinting,\n\nphotographing, or measurements, to write or speak for\n\nidentification, to appear in court, to stand, to assume a\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_176\">                               155</span>\n\fstance, to walk, or to make a particular gesture.&#x27; However, it\n\nwas cautioned that the privilege applied to testimonial\n\ncommunications, irrespective of what form they might take.\n\nHence it was recognised that the privilege not only extended to\n\nverbal communications, but also to written words as well as\n\ngestures intended to communicate [for, e.g., pointing or\n\nnodding]. This line of thinking becomes clear because the\n\nmajority opinion indicated that the distinction between\n\ntestimonial and physical acts may not be readily applicable in\n\nthe case of Lie-Detector tests. Brennan, J. had noted, 384 US\n\n757 (1966), at p. 764:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_125\">     &quot;Although we agree that this distinction is a helpful\n     framework for analysis, we are not to be understood to\n     agree with past applications in all instances. There will\n     be many cases in which such a distinction is not readily\n     drawn. Some tests seemingly directed to obtain `physical\n     evidence,&#x27; for example, lie detector tests measuring\n     changes in body function during interrogation, may\n     actually be directed to eliciting responses which are\n     essentially testimonial. To compel a person to submit to\n     testing in which an effort will be made to determine his\n     guilt or innocence on the basis of physiological\n     responses, whether willed or not, is to evoke the spirit\n     and history of the Fifth Amendment. Such situations call\n     to mind the principle that the protection of the privilege\n     `is as broad as the mischief against which it seeks to\n     guard.&#x27; [...]&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_177\">                              156</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_205\">\fIn a recently published paper, Michael S.

Following   the   Schmerber   decision   (supra.),   the\n\ndistinction between physical and testimonial evidence has\n\nbeen applied in several cases. However, some complexities\n\nhave also arisen in the application of the testimonial-physical\n\ndistinction to various fact-situations. While we do not need to\n\ndiscuss these cases to decide the question before us, we must\n\ntake note of the fact that the application of the testimonial-\n\nphysical distinction can be highly ambiguous in relation to\n\nnon-verbal forms of conduct which nevertheless convey\n\nrelevant information. Among other jurisdictions, the European\n\nCourt of Human Rights (ECtHR) has also taken note of the\n\ndistinction between testimonial and physical acts for the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_178\">                              157</span>\n\fpurpose of invoking the privilege against self-incrimination. In\n\nSaunders v. United Kingdom, (1997) 23 EHRR 313, it was\n\nexplained:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_127\">     &quot;... The right not to incriminate oneself, in particular,\n     presupposes that the prosecution in a criminal case seek\n     to prove their case against the accused without resort to\n     evidence obtained through methods of coercion or\n     oppression in defiance of the will of the accused. In this\n     sense the right is closely linked to the presumption of\n     innocence ... The right not to incriminate oneself is\n     primarily concerned, however, with respecting the will of\n     an accused person to remain silent. As commonly\n     understood in the legal systems of the Contracting\n     Parties to the Convention and elsewhere, it does not\n     extend to the use in criminal proceedings of material\n     which may be obtained from the accused through the use\n     of compulsory powers but which has an existence\n     independent of the will of the suspect such as, inter alia,\n     documents acquired pursuant to a warrant, breath,\n     blood and urine samples and bodily tissue for the\n     purpose of DNA testing.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_207\">Evolution of the law on `medical examination&#x27;\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_208\">140. With respect to the testimonial-physical distinction, an\n\nimportant statutory development in our legal system was the\n\nintroduction of provisions for medical examination with the\n\noverhauling of the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_179\">Code of Criminal Procedure</a> in 1973.\n\n<a href=\"/doc/633996/\" id=\"a_180\">Sections 53</a> and <a href=\"/doc/441720/\" id=\"a_181\">54</a> of the CrPC contemplate the medical\n\nexamination of a person who has been arrested, either at the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_179\">                              158</span>\n\finstance of the investigating officer or even the arrested person\n\nhimself.

However, there were no provisions for authorising such a\n\nmedical examination in the erstwhile <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_182\">Code of Criminal\n\nProcedure</a>, 1898. The absence of a statutory basis for the\n\nsame had led courts to hold that a medical examination could\n\nnot be conducted without the prior consent of the person who\n\nwas to be subjected to the same. For example in <a href=\"/doc/1738066/\" id=\"a_183\">Bhondar v.\n\nEmperor</a>, AIR 1931 Cal 601, Lord Williams, J. held, at p. 602:</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_128\">     &quot;If it were permitted forcibly to take hold of a prisoner\n     and examine his body medically for the purpose of\n     qualifying some medical witness to give medical evidence\n     in the case against the accused there is no knowing\n     where such procedure would stop.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_129\">     ...Any such examination without the consent of the\n     accused would amount to an assault and I am quite\n     satisfied that the police are not entitled without statutory\n     authority to commit assaults upon prisoners for the\n     purpose of procuring evidence against them. If the\n     legislature desires that evidence of this kind should be\n     given, it will be quite simple to add a short section to the\n     <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_184\">Code of Criminal Procedure</a> expressly giving power to\n     order such a medical examination.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_181\">                               159</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_211\">\fS.K.

On the other hand, the counsel for the appellants have\n\ncontended that the Parliament was well aware of the impugned\n\ntechniques   at   the   time   of   the   2005   amendment   and\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_193\">                                167</span>\n\fconsciously chose not to include them in the amended\n\nExplanation to <a href=\"/doc/633996/\" id=\"a_216\">Sections 53</a>, <a href=\"/doc/125412981/\" id=\"a_217\">53-A</a> and <a href=\"/doc/441720/\" id=\"a_218\">54</a> of the CrPC. It was\n\nreasoned that this choice recognised the distinction between\n\ntestimonial   acts   and   physical   evidence.   While   bodily\n\nsubstances such as blood, semen, sputum, sweat, hair and\n\nfingernail clippings can be readily characterised as physical\n\nevidence, the same cannot be said for the techniques in\n\nquestion. This argument was supported by invoking the rule of\n\n`ejusdem generis&#x27; which is used in the interpretation of\n\nstatutes. This rule entails that the meaning of general words\n\nwhich follow specific words in a statutory provision should be\n\nconstrued in light of the commonality between those specific\n\nwords. In the present case, the substances enumerated are all\n\nexamples of physical evidence. Hence the words `and such\n\nother tests&#x27; which appear in the Explanation to <a href=\"/doc/633996/\" id=\"a_219\">Sections 53</a>,\n\n<a href=\"/doc/125412981/\" id=\"a_220\">53-A</a> and <a href=\"/doc/441720/\" id=\"a_221\">54</a> of the CrPC should be construed to include the\n\nexamination of physical evidence but not that of testimonial\n\nacts.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_229\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_194\">                              168</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_230\">\f149. We are inclined towards the view that the results of the\n\nimpugned tests should be treated as testimonial acts for the\n\npurpose of invoking the right against self-incrimination.\n\nTherefore, it would be prudent to state that the phrase `and\n\nsuch other tests&#x27; [which appears in the Explanation to\n\n<a href=\"/doc/633996/\" id=\"a_222\">Sections 53</a>, <a href=\"/doc/125412981/\" id=\"a_223\">53-A</a> and <a href=\"/doc/441720/\" id=\"a_224\">54</a> of the CrPC] should be read so as to\n\nconfine its meaning to include only those tests which involve\n\nthe examination of physical evidence. In pursuance of this line\n\nof reasoning, we agree with the appellant&#x27;s contention about\n\nthe applicability of the rule of `ejusdem generis&#x27;. It should also\n\nbe noted that the Explanation to <a href=\"/doc/633996/\" id=\"a_225\">Sections 53</a>, <a href=\"/doc/125412981/\" id=\"a_226\">53-A</a> and <a href=\"/doc/441720/\" id=\"a_227\">54</a> of\n\nthe CrPC does not enumerate certain other forms of medical\n\nexamination that involve testimonial acts, such as psychiatric\n\nexamination among others. This demonstrates that the\n\namendment to this provision was informed by a rational\n\ndistinction between the examination of physical substances\n\nand testimonial acts.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_231\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_232\">150. However, the submissions touching on the legislative\n\nintent require some reflection. While it is most likely that the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_195\">                               169</span>\n\fParliament was well aware of the impugned techniques at the\n\ntime of the 2005 amendment to the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_228\">CrPC</a> and deliberately\n\nchose not to enumerate them, we cannot arrive at a conclusive\n\nfinding on this issue. While it is open to courts to examine the\n\nlegislative history of a statutory provision, it is not proper for\n\nus to try and conclusively ascertain the legislative intent. Such\n\nan inquiry is impractical since we do not have access to all the\n\nmaterials   which   would    have    been   considered   by   the\n\nParliament. In such a scenario, we must address the\n\nrespondent&#x27;s arguments about the interpretation of statutes\n\nwith regard to scientific advancements. To address this aspect,\n\nwe can refer to some extracts from a leading commentary on\n\nthe interpretation of statutes [See: Justice G.P. Singh,\n\nPrinciples of Statutory Interpretation, 10th edn. (New Delhi:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_139\">Wadhwa &amp; Co. Nagpur, 2006) at pp. 239-247]. The learned\n\nauthor has noted, at pp. 240-241:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_140\">     &quot;Reference to the circumstances existing at the time of\n     the passing of the statute does not, therefore, mean that\n     the language used, at any rate, in a modern statute,\n     should be held to be inapplicable to social, political and\n     economic developments or to scientific inventions not\n     known at the time of the passing of the statute. ... The\n     question again is as to what was the intention of the law\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_196\">                               170</span>\n\fmakers: Did they intend as originalists may argue, that\nthe words of the statute be given the meaning they would\nhave received immediately after the statute&#x27;s enactment\nor did they intend as dynamists may contend that it\nwould be proper for the court to adopt the current\nmeaning of the words? The courts have now generally\nleaned in favour of dynamic construction. [...] But the\ndoctrine has also its limitations. For example it does not\nmean that the language of an old statute can be\nconstrued to embrace something conceptually different.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_141\">The guidance on the question as to when an old statute\ncan apply to new state of affairs not in contemplation\nwhen the statute was enacted was furnished by Lord\nWilberforce in his dissenting speech in Royal College of\nNursing of the U.K. v. Dept. of Health and Social Security,\n(1981) 1 All ER 545, which is now treated as\nauthoritative. (...) Lord Wilberforce said, at pp. 564-565:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_142\">     In interpreting an Act of Parliament it is proper, and\n     indeed necessary, to have regard to the state of\n     affairs existing, and known by Parliament to be\n     existing, at the time. It is a fair presumption that\n     Parliament&#x27;s policy or intention is directed to that\n     state of affairs. Leaving aside cases of omission by\n     inadvertence, this being not such a case when a\n     new state of affairs, or a fresh set of facts bearing on\n     policy, comes into existence, the courts have to\n     consider whether they fall within the parliamentary\n     intention. They may be held to do so, if they fall\n     within the same genus of facts as those to which the\n     expressed policy has been formulated. They may\n     also be held to do so if there can be detected a clear\n     purpose in the legislation which can only be fulfilled\n     if the extension is made. How liberally these\n     principles may be applied must depend on the\n     nature of the enactment, and the strictness or\n     otherwise of the words in which it has been\n     expressed. The courts should be less willing to\n     extend expressed meanings if it is clear that the Act\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_197\">                          171</span>\n\f            in question was designed to be restrictive or\n            circumscribed in its operation rather than liberal or\n            permissive. They will be much less willing to do so\n            where the new subject matter is different in kind or\n            dimension from that for which the legislation was\n            passed. In any event there is one course which the\n            courts cannot take under the law of this country:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_143\">            they cannot fill gaps; they cannot by asking the\n            question, `What would Parliament have done in this\n            current case, not being one in contemplation, if the\n            facts had been before it?&#x27; attempt themselves to\n            supply the answer, if the answer is not to be found\n            in the terms of the Act itself.&quot;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_144\">                                      (internal citations omitted)\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_233\">151. The learned author has further taken note of several\n\ndecisions    where   general   words   appearing    in   statutory\n\nprovisions have been liberally interpreted to include newer\n\nscientific inventions and technologies. [Id. at pp. 244-246] The\n\nrelevant portion of the commentary quotes Subbarao, J. in\n\nSenior Electric Inspector v. Laxminarayan Chopra, AIR\n\n1962 SC 159, at p. 163:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_145\">     &quot;It is perhaps difficult to attribute to a legislative body\n     functioning in a static society that its intention was\n     couched in terms of considerable breadth so as to take\n     within its sweep the future developments comprehended\n     by the phraseology used. It is more reasonable to confine\n     its intention only to the circumstances obtaining at the\n     time the law was made. But in modern progressive\n     society it would be unreasonable to confine the intention\n     of a Legislature to the meaning attributable to the word\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_198\">                                172</span>\n\f     used at the time the law was made, for a modern\n     Legislature making laws to govern society which is fast\n     moving must be presumed to be aware of an enlarged\n     meaning the same concept might attract with the march\n     of time and with the revolutionary changes brought\n     about in social, economic, political and scientific and\n     other fields of human activity. Indeed, unless a contrary\n     intention appears, an interpretation should be given to\n     the words used to take in new facts and situations, if the\n     words are capable of comprehending them.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_234\">152. In light of this discussion, there are some clear\n\nobstructions to the dynamic interpretation of the amended\n\nExplanation to <a href=\"/doc/633996/\" id=\"a_229\">Sections 53</a>, <a href=\"/doc/125412981/\" id=\"a_230\">53-A</a> and <a href=\"/doc/441720/\" id=\"a_231\">54</a> of the CrPC. Firstly,\n\nthe general words in question, i.e. `and such other tests&#x27;\n\nshould ordinarily be read to include tests which are in the\n\nsame genus as the other forms of medical examination that\n\nhave been specified. Since all the explicit references are to the\n\nexamination of bodily substances, we cannot readily construe\n\nthe said phrase to include the impugned tests because the\n\nlatter seem to involve testimonial responses. Secondly, the\n\ncompulsory administration of the impugned techniques is not\n\nthe only means for ensuring an expeditious investigation.\n\nFurthermore, there is also a safe presumption that Parliament\n\nwas well aware of the existence of the impugned techniques\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_199\">                               173</span>\n\fbut deliberately chose not to enumerate them. Hence, on an\n\naggregate understanding of the materials produced before us\n\nwe lean towards the view that the impugned tests, i.e. the\n\nnarcoanalysis technique, polygraph examination and the\n\nBEAP test should not be read into the provisions for `medical\n\nexamination&#x27; under the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_232\">Code of Criminal Procedure</a>, 1973.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_235\">153. However, it must be borne in mind that even though the\n\nimpugned techniques have not been expressly enumerated in\n\nthe <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_233\">CrPC</a>, there is no statutory prohibition against them\n\neither. It is a clear case of silence in the law. Furthermore, in\n\ncircumstances where an individual consents to undergo these\n\ntests, there is no dilution of <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_234\">Article 20(3).</a> In the past, the\n\nmeaning and scope of the term `investigation&#x27; has been held to\n\ninclude measures that had not been enumerated in statutory\n\nprovisions. For example, prior to the enactment of an express\n\nprovision for medical examination in the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_235\">CrPC</a>, it was observed\n\nin Mahipal Maderna v. State of Maharashtra, 1971 Cri L J\n\n1405 (Bom), that an order requiring the production of a hair\n\nsample   comes     within   the      ordinary   understanding   of\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_200\">                               174</span>\n\f`investigation&#x27; (at pp. 1409-1410, Para. 17). <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"147362898\" id=\"span_201\">We must also take\n\nnote of the decision in <a href=\"/doc/147362898/\" id=\"a_236\">Jamshed v. State of Uttar Pradesh</a>,\n\n1976 Cri L J 1680 (All), wherein it was held that a blood\n\nsample can be compulsorily extracted during a `medical\n\nexamination&#x27; conducted under <a href=\"/doc/633996/\" id=\"a_237\">Section 53</a> of the CrPC. At that\n\ntime, the collection of blood samples was not expressly\n\ncontemplated in the said provision. Nevertheless, the Court\n\nhad ruled that the phrase `examination of a person&#x27; should be\n\nread liberally so as to include an examination of what is\n\nexternally visible on a body as well as the examination of an\n\norgan inside the body. [See p. 1689, Para 13]</span>\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_236\">154. We must also refer back to the substance of the decision\n\nin Sharda v. Dharampal, (supra.) which upheld the authority\n\nof a civil court to order a medical examination in exercise of\n\nthe inherent powers vested in it by <a href=\"/doc/56600062/\" id=\"a_238\">Section 151</a> of the Code of\n\nCivil Procedure, 1908. The same reasoning cannot be readily\n\napplied in the criminal context. Despite the absence of a\n\nstatutory basis, it is tenable to hold that criminal courts\n\nshould be allowed to direct the impugned tests with the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_202\">                              175</span>\n\fsubject&#x27;s consent, keeping in mind that there is no statutory\n\nprohibition against them either.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_237\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_238\">155. Another pertinent contention raised by the appellants is\n\nthat the involvement of medical personnel in the compulsory\n\nadministration of the impugned tests is violative of their\n\nprofessional ethics. In particular, criticism was directed\n\nagainst the involvement of doctors in the narcoanalysis\n\ntechnique and it was urged that since the content of the drug-\n\ninduced revelations were shared with investigators, this\n\ntechnique breaches the duty of confidentiality which should be\n\nordinarily maintained by medical practitioners. [See generally:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_146\">Amar Jesani, `Willing participants and tolerant profession:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_147\">Medical ethics and human rights in narco-analysis&#x27;, Indian\n\nJournal of Medical Ethics, Vol. 16(3), July-Sept. 2008] The\n\ncounsel have also cited the text of the `Principles of Medical\n\nEthics&#x27; adopted by the United Nations General Assembly [GA\n\nRes. 37/194, 111th Plenary Meeting] on December 18, 1982.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_148\">This document enumerates some `Principles of Medical Ethics\n\nrelevant to the role of health personnel, particularly physicians,\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_203\">                               176</span>\n\fin the protection of prisoners and detainees against torture, and\n\nother cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment of punishment&#x27;.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_149\">Emphasis was placed on Principle 4 which reads:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_150\">     Principle 4\n     It is a contravention of medical ethics for health\n     personnel, particularly physicians:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_151\">     To apply their knowledge and skills in order to assist in\n     the interrogation of prisoners and detainees in a manner\n     that may adversely affect the physical or mental health or\n     condition of such prisoners or detainees and which is not\n     in     accordance    with   the    relevant    international\n     instruments;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_239\">156. Being a court of law, we do not have the expertise to\n\nmould the specifics of professional ethics for the medical\n\nprofession. Furthermore, the involvement of doctors in the\n\ncourse of investigation in criminal cases has long been\n\nrecognised as an exception to the physician-patient privilege.\n\nIn the Indian context, the statutory provisions for directing a\n\nmedical examination are an example of the same. Fields such\n\nas forensic toxicology have become important in criminal-\n\njustice systems all over the world and doctors are frequently\n\ncalled on to examine bodily substances such as samples of\n\nblood, hair, semen, saliva, sweat, sputum and fingernail\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_204\">                               177</span>\n\fclippings as well as marks, wounds and other physical\n\ncharacteristics. A reasonable limitation on the forensic uses of\n\nmedical expertise is the fact that testimonial acts such as the\n\nresults of a psychiatric examination cannot be used as\n\nevidence without the subject&#x27;s informed consent.\n\n\n\n\nResults of impugned tests should be treated as `personal\n\ntestimony&#x27;\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_240\">157. We now return to the operative question of whether the\n\nresults obtained through polygraph examination and the BEAP\n\ntest should be treated as testimonial responses. Ordinarily\n\nevidence is classified into three broad categories, namely oral\n\ntestimony, documents and material evidence. The protective\n\nscope of <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_239\">Article 20(3)</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/1110422/\" id=\"a_240\">Section 161(2)</a>, CrPC guards\n\nagainst the compulsory extraction of oral testimony, even at\n\nthe stage of investigation. With respect to the production of\n\ndocuments, the applicability of <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_241\">Article 20(3)</a> is decided by the\n\ntrial judge but parties are obliged to produce documents in the\n\nfirst place. However, the compulsory extraction of material (or\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_205\">                              178</span>\n\fphysical) evidence lies outside the protective scope of <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_242\">Article\n\n20(3).</a> Furthermore, even testimony in oral or written form can\n\nbe required under compulsion if it is to be used for the\n\npurpose of identification or comparison with materials and\n\ninformation that is already in the possession of investigators.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_241\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1626264\" id=\"span_206\">158. We have already stated that the narcoanalysis test\n\nincludes substantial reliance on verbal statements by the test\n\nsubject and hence its involuntary administration offends the\n\n`right against self-incrimination&#x27;. The crucial test laid down in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1626264/\" id=\"a_243\">Kathi Kalu Oghad</a>, (supra.) is that of `imparting knowledge in\n\nrespect of relevant fact by means of oral statements or\n\nstatements in writing, by a person who has personal\n\nknowledge of the facts to be communicated to a court or to a\n\nperson holding an enquiry or investigation&#x27; [Id. at p. 30]. The\n\ndifficulty arises since the majority opinion <a href=\"/doc/1626264/\" id=\"a_244\">in that case</a> appears\n\nto confine the understanding of `personal testimony&#x27; to the\n\nconveyance of personal knowledge through oral statements or\n\nstatements in writing. The results obtained from polygraph\n\nexamination or a BEAP test are not in the nature of oral or\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_207\">                               179</span>\n\fwritten statements. Instead, inferences are drawn from the\n\nmeasurement of physiological responses recorded during the\n\nperformance of these tests. It could also be argued that tests\n\nsuch as polygraph examination and the BEAP test do not\n\ninvolve a `positive volitional act&#x27; on part of the test subject and\n\nhence their results should not be treated as testimony.\n\nHowever, this does not entail that the results of these two tests\n\nshould be likened to physical evidence and thereby excluded\n\nfrom the protective scope of <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_245\">Article 20(3).</a></span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1626264\" id=\"span_208\">We must refer back\n\nto the substance of the decision in <a href=\"/doc/1626264/\" id=\"a_246\">Kathi Kalu Oghad</a> (supra.)\n\nwhich equated a testimonial act with the imparting of\n\nknowledge by a person who has personal knowledge of the\n\nfacts that are in issue. It has been recognised in other\n\ndecisions that such personal knowledge about relevant facts\n\ncan also be communicated through means other than oral or\n\nwritten statements.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1306519\" id=\"span_209\">For example in <a href=\"/doc/1306519/\" id=\"a_247\">M.P.

Furthermore, common\n\nsense dictates that certain communicative gestures such as\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_210\">                                180</span>\n\fpointing or nodding can also convey personal knowledge about\n\na relevant fact, without offering a verbal response. It is quite\n\nforeseeable that such a communicative gesture may by itself\n\nexpose a person to `criminal charges or penalties&#x27; or furnish a\n\nlink in the chain of evidence needed for prosecution.</span>\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_242\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1626264\" id=\"span_211\">159. We must also highlight that there is nothing to show that\n\nthe learned judges in <a href=\"/doc/1626264/\" id=\"a_248\">Kathi Kalu Oghad</a> (supra.) had\n\ncontemplated the impugned techniques while discussing the\n\nscope of the phrase `to be a witness&#x27; for the purpose of <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_249\">Article\n\n20(3).</a> At that time, the transmission of knowledge through\n\nmeans other than speech or writing was not something that\n\ncould have been easily conceived of. Techniques such as\n\npolygraph examination were fairly obscure and were the\n\nsubject of experimentation in some Western nations while the\n\nBEAP technique was developed several years later. Just as the\n\ninterpretation of statutes has to be often re-examined in light\n\nof scientific advancements, we should also be willing to re-\n\nexamine judicial observations with a progressive lens. An\n\nexplicit reference to the Lie-Detector tests was of course made\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_212\">                              181</span>\n\fby the U.S. Supreme Court in the Schmerber decision, 384\n\nUS 757 (1966), wherein Brennan, J. had observed, at p. 764:</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_152\">     &quot;To compel a person to submit to testing in which an\n     effort will be made to determine his guilt or innocence on\n     the basis of physiological responses, whether willed or\n     not, is to evoke the spirit and history of the Fifth\n     Amendment.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_243\">160. Even though the actual process of undergoing a\n\npolygraph examination or a BEAP test is not the same as that\n\nof making an oral or written statement, the consequences are\n\nsimilar. By making inferences from the results of these tests,\n\nthe examiner is able to derive knowledge from the subject&#x27;s\n\nmind which otherwise would not have become available to the\n\ninvestigators. These two tests are different from medical\n\nexamination and the analysis of bodily substances such as\n\nblood, semen and hair samples, since the test subject&#x27;s\n\nphysiological responses are directly correlated to mental\n\nfaculties.   Through   lie-detection   or   gauging   a   subject&#x27;s\n\nfamiliarity with the stimuli, personal knowledge is conveyed in\n\nrespect of a relevant fact. It is also significant that unlike the\n\ncase of documents, the investigators cannot possibly have any\n\nprior knowledge of the test subject&#x27;s thoughts and memories,\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_213\">                               182</span>\n\feither in the actual or constructive sense. Therefore, even if a\n\nhighly-strained analogy were to be made between the results\n\nobtained from the impugned tests and the production of\n\ndocuments,    the   weight    of     precedents   leans   towards\n\nrestrictions on the extraction of `personal knowledge&#x27; through\n\nsuch means.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_244\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_245\">161. During the administration of a polygraph test or a BEAP\n\ntest, the subject makes a mental effort which is accompanied\n\nby certain physiological responses. The measurement of these\n\nresponses then becomes the basis of the transmission of\n\nknowledge to the investigators. This knowledge may aid an\n\nongoing investigation or lead to the discovery of fresh evidence\n\nwhich could then be used to prosecute the test subject. In any\n\ncase, the compulsory administration of the impugned tests\n\nimpedes the subject&#x27;s right to choose between remaining silent\n\nand offering substantive information. The requirement of a\n\n`positive volitional act&#x27; becomes irrelevant since the subject is\n\ncompelled to convey personal knowledge irrespective of\n\nhis/her own volition.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_246\">\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_214\">                               183</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_247\">\f162. Some academics have also argued that the results\n\nobtained from tests such as polygraph examination are\n\n`testimonial&#x27; acts that should come within the prohibition of\n\nthe right against self-incrimination. For instance, Michael S.\n\nPardo (2008) has observed [Cited from: Michael S. Pardo, `Self-\n\nIncrimination and the Epistemology of Testimony&#x27;, 30 Cardozo\n\nLaw Review 1023-1046 (December 2008) at p. 1046]:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_153\">     &quot;The results of polygraphs and other lie-detection tests,\n     whether they call for a voluntary response or not, are\n     testimonial because the tests are just inductive evidence\n     of the defendant&#x27;s epistemic state.

Ronald J. Allen and M. Kristin Mace (2004) have offered a\n\ntheory that the right against self-incrimination is meant to\n\nprotect an individual in a situation where the State places\n\nreliance on the `substantive results of cognition&#x27;. The following\n\ndefinition of `cognition&#x27; has been articulated to explain this\n\nposition [Cited from: Ronald J. Allen and M. Kristin Mace, `The\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_215\">                               184</span>\n\fSelf-Incrimination Clause explained and its future predicted&#x27;,\n\n94 Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology 243-293 (2004),\n\nFn. 16 at p. 247]:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_154\">     &quot;... `Cognition&#x27; is used herein to refer to these intellectual\n     processes that allow one to gain and make use of\n     substantive knowledge and to compare one&#x27;s `inner world&#x27;\n     (previous knowledge) with the `outside world&#x27; (stimuli\n     such as questions from an interrogator).

The above-mentioned authors have taken a hypothetical\n\nexample where the inferences drawn from an involuntary\n\npolygraph test that did not require verbal answers, led to the\n\ndiscovery of incriminating evidence. They have argued that if\n\nthe scope of the Fifth Amendment extends to protecting the\n\nsubject in respect of `substantive results of cognition&#x27;, then\n\nreliance on polygraph test results would violate the said right.\n\nA similar conclusion has also been made by the National\n\nHuman Rights Commission, as evident from the following\n\nextract   in   the   Guidelines Relating   to Administration    of\n\nPolygraph Test [Lie Detector Test] on an Accused (2000):\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_216\">                                185</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_155\">\f     &quot;The extent and nature of the `self-incrimination&#x27; is wide\n     enough to cover the kinds of statements that were sought\n     to be induced. In M.P. Sharma, AIR 1954 SC 300, the\n     Supreme Court included within the protection of the self-\n     incrimination rule all positive volitional acts which\n     furnish evidence. This by itself would have made all or\n     any interrogation impossible. The test - as stated in\n     Kathi Kalu Oghad (AIR 1961 SC 1808) - retains the\n     requirement of personal volition and states that `self-\n     incrimination&#x27; must mean conveying information based\n     upon the personal knowledge of the person giving\n     information. By either test, the information sought to be\n     elicited in a Lie Detector Test is information in the\n     personal knowledge of the accused.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_251\">165. In light of the preceding discussion, we are of the view\n\nthat the results obtained from tests such as polygraph\n\nexamination and the BEAP test should also be treated as\n\n`personal testimony&#x27;, since they are a means for `imparting\n\npersonal     knowledge    about    relevant   facts&#x27;.   Hence,    our\n\nconclusion    is   that   the   results   obtained      through   the\n\ninvoluntary administration of either of the impugned tests (i.e.\n\nthe narcoanalysis technique, polygraph examination and the\n\nBEAP test) come within the scope of `testimonial compulsion&#x27;,\n\nthereby attracting the protective shield of <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_250\">Article 20(3).</a>\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_217\">                                  186</span>\n\fII.   Whether    the   involuntary       administration    of     the\n\nimpugned     techniques     is   a     reasonable   restriction   on\n\n`personal liberty&#x27; as understood in the context of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_251\">Article\n\n21</a> of the Constitution?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_252\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_253\">166. The preceding discussion does not conclusively address\n\nthe contentions before us. <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_252\">Article 20(3)</a> protects a person who\n\nis `formally accused&#x27; of having committed an offence or even a\n\nsuspect or a witness who is questioned during an investigation\n\nin a criminal case. However, <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_253\">Article 20(3)</a> is not applicable\n\nwhen a person gives his/her informed consent to undergo any\n\nof the impugned tests. It has also been described earlier that\n\nthe `right against self-incrimination&#x27; does not protect persons\n\nwho may be compelled to undergo the tests in the course of\n\nadministrative proceedings or any other proceedings which\n\nmay result in civil liability. It is also conceivable that a person\n\nwho is forced to undergo these tests may not subsequently\n\nface criminal charges. In this context, <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_254\">Article 20(3)</a> will not\n\napply in situations where the test results could become the\n\nbasis of non-penal consequences for the subject such as\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_218\">                                 187</span>\n\fcustodial abuse, police surveillance and harassment among\n\nothers.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_254\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_255\">167. In order to account for these possibilities, we must\n\nexamine whether the involuntary administration of any of\n\nthese tests is compatible with the constitutional guarantee of\n\n`substantive due process&#x27;. The standard of `substantive due\n\nprocess&#x27; is of course the threshold for examining the validity of\n\nall categories of governmental action that tend to infringe upon\n\nthe idea of `personal liberty. We will proceed with this inquiry\n\nwith regard to the various dimensions of `personal liberty&#x27; as\n\nunderstood in the context of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_255\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution,\n\nwhich lays down that:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_156\">     `No person shall be deprived of his life and liberty except\n     according to procedure established by law&#x27;.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_256\">168. Since administering the impugned tests entails the\n\nphysical confinement of the subject, it is important to consider\n\nwhether they can be read into an existing statutory provision.\n\nThis is so because any form of restraint on personal liberty,\n\nhowsoever slight it may be, must have a basis in law. However,\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_219\">                               188</span>\n\fwe have already explained how it would not be prudent to read\n\nthe explanation to <a href=\"/doc/633996/\" id=\"a_256\">Sections 53</a>, <a href=\"/doc/125412981/\" id=\"a_257\">53-A</a> and <a href=\"/doc/441720/\" id=\"a_258\">54</a> of the CrPC in an\n\nexpansive manner so as to include the impugned techniques.\n\nThe second line of inquiry is whether the involuntary\n\nadministration of these tests offends certain rights that have\n\nbeen read into <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_259\">Article 21</a> by way of judicial precedents. The\n\ncontentions before us have touched on aspects such as the\n\n`right to privacy&#x27; and the `right against cruel, inhuman and\n\ndegrading treatment&#x27;. The third line of inquiry is structured\n\naround the right to fair trial which is an essential component\n\nof `personal liberty&#x27;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_257\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_258\">169. There are several ways in which the involuntary\n\nadministration of either of the impugned tests could be viewed\n\nas a restraint on `personal liberty&#x27;. The most obvious indicator\n\nof restraint is the use of physical force to ensure that an\n\nunwilling person is confined to the premises where the tests\n\nare   to   be   conducted.   Furthermore,   the   drug-induced\n\nrevelations or the substantive inferences drawn from the\n\nmeasurement of the subject&#x27;s physiological responses can be\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_220\">                              189</span>\n\fdescribed as an intrusion into the subject&#x27;s mental privacy. It\n\nis also quite conceivable that a person could make an\n\nincriminating     statement      on    being   threatened      with   the\n\nprospective     administration    of    any    of   these    techniques.\n\nConversely, a person who has been forcibly subjected to these\n\ntechniques could be confronted with the results in a\n\nsubsequent      interrogation,    thereby      eliciting    incriminating\n\nstatements.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_259\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_260\">170. We must also account for circumstances where a person\n\nwho undergoes the said tests is subsequently exposed to\n\nharmful consequences, though not of a penal nature. We have\n\nalready expressed our concern with situations where the\n\ncontents of the test results could prompt investigators to\n\nengage in custodial abuse, surveillance or undue harassment.\n\nWe have also been apprised of some instances where the\n\ninvestigation agencies have leaked the video-recordings of\n\nnarcoanalysis interviews to media organisations. This is an\n\nespecially worrisome practice since the public distribution of\n\nthese recordings can expose the subject to undue social\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_221\">                                  190</span>\n\fstigma and specific risks. It may even encourage acts of\n\nvigilantism in addition to a `trial by media&#x27;.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_261\">171. We must remember that the law does provide for some\n\nrestrictions on `personal liberty&#x27; in the routine exercise of\n\npolice powers. For instance, the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_260\">CrPC</a> incorporates an\n\nelaborate scheme prescribing the powers of arrest, detention,\n\ninterrogation, search and seizure. A fundamental premise of\n\nthe criminal justice system is that the police and the judiciary\n\nare empowered to exercise a reasonable degree of coercive\n\npowers. Hence, the provision that enables Courts to order a\n\nperson who is under arrest to undergo a medical examination\n\nalso provides for the use of `force as is reasonably necessary&#x27;\n\nfor this purpose. It is evident that the notion of `personal\n\nliberty&#x27; does not grant rights in the absolute sense and the\n\nvalidity of restrictions placed on the same needs to be\n\nevaluated on the basis of criterion such as `fairness, non-\n\narbitrariness, and reasonableness&#x27;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_262\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_222\">                                191</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_263\">\f172.

Even though the extracted sample of blood is purely\n\nphysical evidence as opposed to a narcoanalysis interview\n\nwhere the test subject offers testimonial responses, the\n\ncomparison can be sustained to examine whether puncturing\n\nthe skin with a needle or an injection is an unreasonable\n\nrestraint on `personal liberty&#x27;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_264\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_265\">173.

With regard to the facts in that case, Felix\n\nFrankfurter, J. had decided that the extraction of evidence had\n\nindeed violated the same, Id. at pp. 172-173:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_266\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_223\">                                   192</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_157\">\f      &quot; ... we are compelled to conclude that the proceedings by\n      which this conviction was obtained do more than offend\n      some       fastidious     squeamishness       or     private\n      sentimentalism about combating crime too energetically.\n      This is conduct that shocks the conscience. Illegally\n      breaking into the privacy of the petitioner, the struggle to\n      open his mouth and remove what was there, the forcible\n      extraction of his stomach&#x27;s contents - this course of\n      proceeding by agents of government to obtain evidence is\n      bound to offend even hardened sensibilities.

Coming to the cases cited before us, in State of\n\nMaharashtra v. Sheshappa Dudhappa Tambade, AIR 1964\n\nBom      253,   the   Bombay   High   Court   had    upheld   the\n\nconstitutionality of <a href=\"/doc/109466239/\" id=\"a_261\">Section 129-A</a> of the Bombay Prohibition\n\nAct, 1949. This provision empowered prohibition officers and\n\npolice    personnel    to   produce   a   person    for   `medical\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_224\">                                193</span>\n\fexamination&#x27;, which could include the collection of a blood\n\nsample. The said provision authorised the use of `all means\n\nreasonably necessary to secure the production of such person\n\nor the examination of his body or the collection of blood\n\nnecessary for the test&#x27;. Evidently, the intent behind this\n\nprovision was to enforce the policy of prohibition on the\n\nconsumption of intoxicating liquors. Among other questions,\n\nthe Court also ruled that this provision did not violate Article\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_268\">21. Reliance was placed on a decision of the U.S. Supreme\n\nCourt in Paul H. Breithaupt v. Morris Abram, 352 US 432\n\n(1957),    wherein   the   contentious   issue   was   whether    a\n\nconviction on the basis of an involuntary blood-test violated\n\nthe guarantee of `due process of law&#x27;. In deciding that the\n\ninvoluntary extraction of the blood sample did not violate the\n\nguarantee of `Due Process of Law&#x27;, Clark, J. observed, at pp.\n\n435-437:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_159\">     &quot; ... there is nothing `brutal&#x27; or `offensive&#x27; in the taking of\n     a blood sample when done as in this case, under the\n     protective eye of a physician. To be sure, the driver here\n     was unconscious when the blood was taken, but the\n     absence of conscious consent, without more, does not\n     necessarily render the taking a violation of a\n     constitutional right and certainly the test administered\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_225\">                                194</span>\n\f     here would not be considered offensive by even the most\n     delicate. Furthermore, due process is not measured by\n     the yardstick of personal reaction or the sphygmogram of\n     the most sensitive person, but by that whole community\n     sense of `decency and fairness&#x27; that has been woven by\n     common experience into the fabric of acceptable conduct.\n     It is on this bedrock that this Court has established the\n     concept of due process. The blood test procedure has\n     become routine in our everyday life. It is a ritual for those\n     going into the military service as well as those applying\n     for marriage licenses. Many colleges require such tests\n     before permitting entrance and literally millions of us\n     have voluntarily gone through the same, though a longer,\n     routine in becoming blood donors. Likewise, we note that\n     a majority of our States have either enacted statutes in\n     some form authorizing tests of this nature or permit\n     findings so obtained to be admitted in evidence. We\n     therefore conclude that a blood test taken by a skilled\n     technician is not such `conduct that shocks the\n     conscience&#x27; [Rochin v. California, 342 US 165, 172\n     (1952)], nor such a method of obtaining evidence that it\n     offends a `sense of justice&#x27; [Brown v. Mississippi, 297 US\n     278, 285 (1936)]...&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_269\">175. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"147362898\" id=\"span_226\">In <a href=\"/doc/147362898/\" id=\"a_262\">Jamshed v.

If a culprit is\n     suspected to have swallowed some stolen article, an\n     emetic may be used and X-ray examination may also be\n     necessary. For such purposes the law permits the use of\n     necessary force.

This line of precedents shows that the compelled\n\nextraction of blood samples in the course of a medical\n\nexamination does not amount to `conduct that shocks the\n\nconscience&#x27;. There is also an endorsement of the view that the\n\nuse of `force as may be reasonably necessary&#x27; is mandated by\n\nlaw and hence it meets the threshold of `procedure established\n\nby    law&#x27;.   In     this     light,   we      must    restate   two   crucial\n\nconsiderations that are relevant for the case before us. Firstly,\n\nthe restrictions placed on `personal liberty&#x27; in the course of\n\nadministering the impugned techniques are not limited to\n\nphysical confinement and the extraction of bodily substances.\n\nAll the three techniques in question also involve testimonial\n\nresponses. Secondly, most of the above-mentioned cases were\n\ndecided in accordance with the threshold of `procedure\n\nestablished by law&#x27; for restraining `personal liberty&#x27;. However,\n\nin    this    case    we      must       use    a     broader    standard   of\n\nreasonableness to evaluate the validity of the techniques in\n\nquestion. This wider inquiry calls for deciding whether they\n\nare    compatible           with   the      various     judicially-recognised\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_231\">                                         197</span>\n\fdimensions of `personal liberty&#x27; such as the right to privacy,\n\nthe right against cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment and\n\nthe right to fair trial.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_273\">\n\nApplicability of the `right to privacy&#x27;\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_274\">177. In Sharda v. Dharampal, (supra.) this Court had upheld\n\nthe power of a civil court to order the medical examination of a\n\nparty to a divorce proceeding. In that case, the medical\n\nexamination was considered necessary for ascertaining the\n\nmental condition of one of the parties and it was held that a\n\ncivil court could direct the same in the exercise of its inherent\n\npowers, despite the absence of an enabling provision. In\n\narriving at this decision it was also considered whether\n\nsubjecting a person to a medical examination would violate\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_271\">Article 21.</a> We must highlight the fact that a medical test for\n\nascertaining the mental condition of a person is most likely to\n\nbe in the nature of a psychiatric evaluation which usually\n\nincludes testimonial responses. Accordingly, a significant part\n\nof that judgment dealt with the `right to privacy&#x27;.

The discussion on the `right to privacy&#x27; in Sharda v.\n\nDharampal, (supra.) also cited a decision of the Court of\n\nAppeal (in the U.K.) in R (on the application of S) v. Chief\n\nConstable of South Yorkshire, (2003) 1 All ER 148 (CA). The\n\ncontentious issues arose in respect of the retention of\n\nfingerprints and DNA samples taken from persons who had\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_248\">                                205</span>\n\fbeen suspected of having committed offences in the past but\n\nwere not convicted for them. It was argued that this policy\n\nviolated <a href=\"/doc/691208/\" id=\"a_291\">Articles 8</a> and <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_292\">14</a> of the European Convention on\n\nHuman Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, 1950 [Hereinafter\n\n`EctHR]. <a href=\"/doc/691208/\" id=\"a_293\">Article 8</a> deals with the `Right to respect for private\n\nand family life&#x27; while <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_294\">Article 14</a> lays down the scope of the\n\n`Prohibition   Against   Discrimination&#x27;.   For   the    present\n\ndiscussion, it will be useful to examine the language of <a href=\"/doc/691208/\" id=\"a_295\">Article\n\n8</a> of the EctHR:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_167\">     <a href=\"/doc/691208/\" id=\"a_296\">Article 8 -</a> Right to respect for private and family life\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_168\">     1.

In that case, a distinction was drawn between the\n\n`taking&#x27;, `retention&#x27; and `use&#x27; of fingerprints and DNA samples.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_286\">While the `taking&#x27; of such samples from individual suspects\n\ncould be described as a reasonable measure in the course of\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_249\">                              206</span>\n\froutine police functions, the controversy arose with respect to\n\nthe `retention&#x27; of samples taken from individuals who had been\n\nsuspected of having committing offences in the past but had\n\nnot been convicted for them. The statutory basis for the\n\nretention of physical samples taken from suspects was Section\n\n64(1A) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act, 1984. This\n\nprovision also laid down that these samples could only be\n\nused for purposes related to the `prevention or detection of\n\ncrime, the investigation of an offence or the conduct of a\n\nprosecution&#x27;. This section had been amended to alter the older\n\nposition which provided that physical samples taken from\n\nsuspects were meant to be destroyed once the suspect was\n\ncleared of the charges or acquitted. As per the older position, it\n\nwas only the physical samples taken from convicted persons\n\nwhich could be retained by the police authorities. It was\n\ncontended that the amended provision was incompatible with\n\n<a href=\"/doc/691208/\" id=\"a_297\">Articles 8</a> and <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_298\">14</a> of the EctHR and hence the relief sought was\n\nthat the fingerprints and DNA samples of the concerned\n\nparties should be destroyed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_287\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_250\">                               207</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_288\">\f187. In response to these contentions, the majority (Lord\n\nWoolf, C.J.) held that although the retention of such material\n\ninterfered with the <a href=\"/doc/1266611/\" id=\"a_299\">Art. 8(1)</a> rights of the individuals (`right to\n\nrespect for private and family life&#x27;) from whom it had been\n\ntaken, that interference was justified by <a href=\"/doc/1444915/\" id=\"a_300\">Art. 8(2).</a> It was\n\nfurther     reasoned     that   the   purpose    of   the   impugned\n\namendment, the language of which was very similar to <a href=\"/doc/1444915/\" id=\"a_301\">Art.\n\n8(2)</a>,    was   obvious    and    lawful.   Nor   were   the   adverse\n\nconsequences to the individual disproportionate to the benefit\n\nto the public. It was held, at Para. 17:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_171\">        &quot;So far as the prevention and detection of crime is\n        concerned, it is obvious the larger the databank of\n        fingerprints and DNA samples available to the police, the\n        greater the value of the databank will be in preventing\n        crime and detecting those responsible for crime. There\n        can be no doubt that if every member of the public was\n        required to provide fingerprints and a DNA sample this\n        would make a dramatic contribution to the prevention\n        and detection of crime. To take but one example, the\n        great majority of rapists who are not known already to\n        their victim would be able to be identified. However, the\n        1984 Act does not contain blanket provisions either as to\n        the taking, the retention, or the use of fingerprints or\n        samples; Parliament has decided upon a balanced\n        approach.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_251\">                                  208</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_289\">\fLord Woolf, C.J. also referred to the following observations\n\nmade by Lord Steyn in an earlier decision of the House of\n\nLords, which was reported as Attorney General&#x27;s Reference\n\n(No. 3 of 1999), (2001) 1 All ER 577, at p. 584:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_172\">     &quot;... It must be borne in mind that respect for the privacy\n     of defendants is not the only value at stake. The purpose\n     of the criminal law is to permit everyone to go about their\n     daily lives without fear of harm to person or property.\n     And it is in the interests of everyone that serious crime\n     should be effectively investigated and prosecuted. There\n     must be fairness to all sides. In a criminal case this\n     requires the court to consider a triangulation of interests.\n     It involves taking into account the position of the\n     accused, the victim and his or her family, and the\n     public.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_290\">On the question of whether the retention of material samples\n\ncollected from suspects who had not been convicted was\n\nviolative of the `Prohibition against Discrimination&#x27; under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_302\">Art.\n\n14</a> of the EctHR, it was observed, (2003) 1 All ER 148 (CA), at\n\np. 162:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_173\">     &quot;In the present circumstances when an offence is being\n     investigated or is the subject of a charge it is accepted\n     that fingerprints and samples may be taken.

In the present case, written submissions made on behalf\n\nof the respondents have tried to liken the compulsory\n\nadministration of the impugned techniques with the DNA\n\nprofiling technique. In light of this attempted analogy, we must\n\nstress that the DNA profiling technique has been expressly\n\nincluded among the various forms of medical examination in\n\nthe amended explanation to <a href=\"/doc/633996/\" id=\"a_303\">Sections 53</a>, <a href=\"/doc/125412981/\" id=\"a_304\">53-A</a> and <a href=\"/doc/441720/\" id=\"a_305\">54</a> of the\n\nCrPC. It must also be clarified that a `DNA profile&#x27; is different\n\nfrom a DNA sample which can be obtained from bodily\n\nsubstances. A DNA profile is a record created on the basis of\n\nDNA samples made available to forensic experts. Creating and\n\nmaintaining DNA profiles of offenders and suspects are useful\n\npractices since newly obtained DNA samples can be readily\n\nmatched with existing profiles that are already in the\n\npossession of law-enforcement agencies. The matching of DNA\n\nsamples is emerging as a vital tool for linking suspects to\n\nspecific criminal acts. It may also be recalled that the as per\n\nthe majority decision in <a href=\"/doc/1626264/\" id=\"a_306\">Kathi Kalu Oghad</a>, (supra.) the use\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_254\">                               210</span>\n\fof material samples such as fingerprints for the purpose of\n\ncomparison    and   identification    does   not   amount   to   a\n\ntestimonial act for the purpose of <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_307\">Article 20(3).</a> Hence, the\n\ntaking and retention of DNA samples which are in the nature\n\nof physical evidence does not face constitutional hurdles in the\n\nIndian context. However, if the DNA profiling technique is\n\nfurther developed and used for testimonial purposes, then\n\nsuch uses in the future could face challenges in the judicial\n\ndomain.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_292\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_293\">189. The judgment delivered in Sharda v. Dharampal,\n\n(supra.) had surveyed the above-mentioned decisions to\n\nconclude that a person&#x27;s right to privacy could be justifiably\n\ncurtailed if it was done in light of competing interests.\n\nReference was also made to some statutes that permitted the\n\ncompulsory administration of medical tests. For instance, it\n\nwas observed, at Para. 61-62:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_174\">     &quot;Having outlined the law relating to privacy in India, it is\n     relevant in this context to notice that certain laws have\n     been enacted by the Indian Parliament where the\n     accused may be subjected to certain medical or other\n     tests.\n</blockquote>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_255\">                                211</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_175\">\f     By way of example, we may refer to <a href=\"/doc/139481594/\" id=\"a_308\">Sections 185</a>, <a href=\"/doc/37876545/\" id=\"a_309\">202</a>,\n     <a href=\"/doc/11563856/\" id=\"a_310\">203</a> and <a href=\"/doc/24716656/\" id=\"a_311\">204</a> of the Motor Vehicles Act, <a href=\"/doc/633996/\" id=\"a_312\">Sections 53</a> and\n     <a href=\"/doc/441720/\" id=\"a_313\">54</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure and <a href=\"/doc/814675/\" id=\"a_314\">Section 3</a> of the\n     Identification of Prisoners Act, 1920.

However, it is important for us to distinguish between the\n\nconsiderations that occupied this Court&#x27;s attention in Sharda\n\nv. Dharampal, (supra.) and the ones that we are facing in the\n\npresent case. It is self-evident that the decision did not to\n\ndwell on the distinction between medical tests whose results\n\nare based on testimonial responses and those tests whose\n\nresults are based on the analysis of physical characteristics\n\nand bodily substances. It can be safely stated that the Court\n\ndid not touch on the distinction between testimonial acts and\n\nphysical   evidence,   simply   because   <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_317\">Article   20(3)</a>   is   not\n\napplicable to a proceeding of a civil nature.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_295\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_296\">191. Moreover, a distinction must be made between the\n\ncharacter of restraints placed on the right to privacy. While the\n\nordinary exercise of police powers contemplates restraints of a\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_256\">                                212</span>\n\fphysical nature such as the extraction of bodily substances\n\nand the use of reasonable force for subjecting a person to a\n\nmedical examination, it is not viable to extend these police\n\npowers to the forcible extraction of testimonial responses. In\n\nconceptualising the `right to privacy&#x27; we must highlight the\n\ndistinction between privacy in a physical sense and the\n\nprivacy of one&#x27;s mental processes.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_297\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_298\">192. So far, the judicial understanding of privacy in our\n\ncountry has mostly stressed on the protection of the body and\n\nphysical spaces from intrusive actions by the State. While the\n\nscheme of criminal procedure as well as evidence law\n\nmandates interference with physical privacy through statutory\n\nprovisions that enable arrest, detention, search and seizure\n\namong others, the same cannot be the basis for compelling a\n\nperson `to impart personal knowledge about a relevant fact&#x27;.\n\nThe theory of interrelationship of rights mandates that the\n\nright against self-incrimination should also be read as a\n\ncomponent of `personal liberty&#x27; under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_318\">Article 21.</a> Hence, our\n\nunderstanding of the `right to privacy&#x27; should account for its\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_257\">                              213</span>\n\fintersection with <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_319\">Article 20(3).</a> Furthermore, the `rule against\n\ninvoluntary confessions&#x27; as embodied in <a href=\"/doc/967059/\" id=\"a_320\">Sections 24</a>, <a href=\"/doc/494844/\" id=\"a_321\">25</a>, <a href=\"/doc/387768/\" id=\"a_322\">26</a>\n\nand <a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_323\">27</a> of the Evidence Act, 1872 seeks to serve both the\n\nobjectives of reliability as well as voluntariness of testimony\n\ngiven in a custodial setting. A conjunctive reading of <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_324\">Articles\n\n20(3)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_325\">21</a> of the Constitution along with the principles of\n\nevidence law leads us to a clear answer. We must recognise\n\nthe importance of personal autonomy in aspects such as the\n\nchoice between remaining silent and speaking. An individual&#x27;s\n\ndecision to make a statement is the product of a private choice\n\nand there should be no scope for any other individual to\n\ninterfere with such autonomy, especially in circumstances\n\nwhere the person faces exposure to criminal charges or\n\npenalties.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_299\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_300\">193. Therefore, it is our considered opinion that subjecting a\n\nperson to the impugned techniques in an involuntary manner\n\nviolates     the   prescribed   boundaries   of   privacy.   Forcible\n\ninterference with a person&#x27;s mental processes is not provided\n\nfor under any statute and it most certainly comes into conflict\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_258\">                                  214</span>\n\fwith the `right against self-incrimination&#x27;. However, this\n\ndetermination does not account for circumstances where a\n\nperson could be subjected to any of the impugned tests but\n\nnot exposed to criminal charges and the possibility of\n\nconviction. In such cases, he/she could still face adverse\n\nconsequences such as custodial abuse, surveillance, undue\n\nharassment and social stigma among others. In order to\n\naddress such circumstances, it is important to examine some\n\nother dimensions of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_326\">Article 21.</a>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_301\">\n\nSafeguarding    the   `right   against   cruel,   inhuman   or\n\ndegrading treatment&#x27;\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_302\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"162242\" id=\"span_259\">194. We will now examine whether the act of forcibly\n\nsubjecting a person to any of the impugned techniques\n\nconstitutes `cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment&#x27;, when\n\nconsidered by itself. This inquiry will account for the\n\npermissibility of these techniques in all settings, including\n\nthose where a person may not be subsequently prosecuted but\n\ncould face adverse consequences of a non-penal nature. The\n\nappellants have contended that the use of the impugned\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_260\">                               215</span>\n\ftechniques   amounts     to   `cruel,   inhuman    or   degrading\n\ntreatment&#x27;. Even though the Indian Constitution does not\n\nexplicitly enumerate a protection against `cruel, inhuman or\n\ndegrading punishment or treatment&#x27; in a manner akin to the\n\nEighth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, this Court has\n\ndiscussed this aspect in several cases. For example, in <a href=\"/doc/162242/\" id=\"a_327\">Sunil\n\nBatra v. Delhi Administration</a>, (1978) 4 SCC 494, V.R.\n\nKrishna Iyer, J. observed at pp. 518-519:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_176\">     &quot;True, our Constitution has no `due process&#x27; clause or the\n     VIII Amendment; but, in this branch of law, after Cooper\n     [(1970) 1 SCC 248] and Maneka Gandhi, [(1978) 1 SCC\n     248] the consequence is the same. For what is punitively\n     outrageous, scandalizingly unusual or cruel and\n     rehabilitatively    counter-productive,      is   unarguably\n     unreasonable and arbitrary and is shot down by <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_328\">Article\n     14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_329\">19</a> and if inflicted with procedural unfairness,\n     falls foul of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_330\">Article 21.</a> Part III of the Constitution does\n     not part company with the prisoner at the gates, and\n     judicial oversight protects the prisoner&#x27;s shrunken\n     fundamental rights, if flouted, frowned upon or frozen by\n     the prison authority.

In the above-mentioned case, this Court had disapproved\n\nof practices such as solitary-confinement and the use of bar-\n\nfetters in prisons. It was held that prisoners were also entitled\n\nto `personal liberty&#x27; though in a limited sense, and hence\n\njudges   could    enquire     into    the   reasonableness    of   their\n\ntreatment by prison-authorities. Even though `the right\n\nagainst cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment&#x27; cannot be\n\nasserted in an absolute sense, there is a sufficient basis to\n\nshow that <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_335\">Article 21</a> can be invoked to protect the `bodily\n\nintegrity and dignity&#x27; of persons who are in custodial\n\nenvironments. This protection extends not only to prisoners\n\nwho are convicts and under-trials, but also to those persons\n\nwho   may    be    arrested     or     detained   in   the   course   of\n\ninvestigations in criminal cases. Judgments such as <a href=\"/doc/501198/\" id=\"a_336\">D.K.\n\nBasu v. State of West Bengal</a>, AIR 1997 SC 610, have\n\nstressed upon the importance of preventing the `cruel,\n\ninhuman or degrading treatment&#x27; of any person who is taken\n\ninto custody. In respect of the present case, any person who is\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_263\">                                     217</span>\n\fforcibly subjected to the impugned tests in the environs of a\n\nforensic laboratory or a hospital would be effectively in a\n\ncustodial environment for the same.

The definition of torture indicates that the threshold for\n\nthe same is the intentional infliction of physical or mental pain\n\nand suffering, by or at the instance of a public official for the\n\npurpose of extracting information or confessions. `Cruel,\n\nInhuman or Degrading Treatment&#x27; has been defined as\n\nconduct that does not amount to torture but is wide enough to\n\ncover all kinds of abuses. Hence, proving the occurrence of\n\n`cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment&#x27; would require a lower\n\nthreshold than that of torture. In addition to highlighting these\n\ndefinitions, the counsel for the appellants have submitted that\n\ncausing physical pain by injecting a drug can amount to\n\n`Injury&#x27; as defined by <a href=\"/doc/1106981/\" id=\"a_352\">Section 44</a> of the IPC or `Hurt&#x27; as defined\n\nin Section 319 of the same Code.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_320\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_321\">201. In response, the counsel for the respondents have drawn\n\nour attention to literature which suggests that in the case of\n\nthe impugned techniques, the intention on part of the\n\ninvestigators is to extract information and not to inflict any\n\npain or suffering. Furthermore, it has been contended that the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_269\">                               223</span>\n\factual administration of either the narcoanalysis technique,\n\npolygraph examination or the BEAP test does not involve a\n\ncondemnable degree of `physical pain or suffering&#x27;. Even\n\nthough some physical force may be used or threats may be\n\ngiven to compel a person to undergo the tests, it was argued\n\nthat the administration of these tests ordinarily does not\n\nresult in physical injuries. [See: Linda M. Keller, `Is Truth\n\nSerum Torture?&#x27; 20 American University International Law\n\nReview 521-612 (2005)] However, it is quite conceivable that\n\nthe administration of any of these techniques could involve the\n\ninfliction of `mental pain or suffering&#x27; and the contents of their\n\nresults could expose the subject to physical abuse. When a\n\nperson undergoes a narcoanalysis test, he/she is in a half-\n\nconscious state and subsequently does not remember the\n\nrevelations made in a drug-induced state. In the case of\n\npolygraph examination and the BEAP test, the test subject\n\nremains fully conscious during the tests but does not\n\nimmediately know the nature and implications of the results\n\nderived from the same. However, when he/she later learns\n\nabout the contents of the revelations, they may prove to be\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_270\">                               224</span>\n\fincriminatory or be in the nature of testimony that can be\n\nused to prosecute other individuals. We have also highlighted\n\nthe likelihood of a person making incriminatory statements\n\nwhen he/she is subsequently confronted with the test results.\n\nThe realisation of such consequences can indeed cause\n\n`mental pain or suffering&#x27; for the person who was subjected to\n\nthese tests. The test results could also support the theories or\n\nsuspicions of the investigators in a particular case. These\n\nresults could very well confirm suspicions about a person&#x27;s\n\ninvolvement in a criminal act. For a person in custody, such\n\nconfirmations could lead to specifically targeted behaviour\n\nsuch as physical abuse. In this regard, we have repeatedly\n\nexpressed our concern with situations where the test results\n\ncould trigger undesirable behaviour.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_322\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_323\">202. We must also contemplate situations where a threat\n\ngiven by the investigators to conduct any of the impugned\n\ntests could prompt a person to make incriminatory statements\n\nor to undergo some mental trauma. Especially in cases of\n\nindividuals from weaker sections of society who are unaware\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_271\">                              225</span>\n\fof their fundamental rights and unable to afford legal advice,\n\nthe mere apprehension of undergoing scientific tests that\n\nsupposedly reveal the truth could push them to make\n\nconfessional statements. Hence, the act of threatening to\n\nadminister the impugned tests could also elicit testimony. It is\n\nalso quite conceivable that an individual may give his/her\n\nconsent to undergo the said tests on account of threats, false\n\npromises or deception by the investigators. For example, a\n\nperson may be convinced to give his/her consent after being\n\npromised that this would lead to an early release from custody\n\nor dropping of charges. However, after the administration of\n\nthe tests the investigators may renege on such promises. In\n\nsuch a case the relevant inquiry is not confined to the\n\napparent voluntariness of the act of undergoing the tests, but\n\nalso includes an examination of the totality of circumstances.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_324\">203. Such a possibility had been outlined by the National\n\nHuman Rights Commission which had published `Guidelines\n\nrelating to administration of Polygraph test (Lie Detector test) on\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_272\">                                226</span>\n\fan accused (2000)&#x27;. The relevant extract has been reproduced\n\nbelow:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_186\">     &quot;... The lie detector test is much too invasive to admit of\n     the argument that the authority for Lie Detector tests\n     comes from the general power to interrogate and answer\n     questions or make statements. (Ss. 160-167 <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_353\">CrPC</a>)\n     However, in India we must proceed on the assumption of\n     constitutional       invasiveness        and     evidentiary\n     impermissiveness to take the view that such holding of\n     tests is a prerogative of the individual, not an\n     empowerment of the police. In as much as this invasive\n     test is not authorised by law, it must perforce be\n     regarded as illegal and unconstitutional unless it is\n     voluntarily       undertaken        under       non-coercive\n     circumstances. If the police action of conducting a lie\n     detector test is not authorised by law and impermissible,\n     the only basis on which it could be justified is, if it is\n     volunteered. There is a distinction between: (a)\n     volunteering, and (b) being asked to volunteer. This\n     distinction is of some significance in the light of the\n     statutory and constitutional protections available to any\n     person. There is a vast difference between a person\n     saying, `I wish to take a lie detector test because I wish to\n     clear my name&#x27;, and when a person is told by the police,\n     `If you want to clear your name, take a lie detector test&#x27;. A\n     still worse situation would be where the police say, `Take\n     a lie detector test, and we will let you go&#x27;. In the first\n     example, the person voluntarily wants to take the test. It\n     would still have to be examined whether such\n     volunteering was under coercive circumstances or not. In\n     the second and third examples, the police implicitly (in\n     the second example) and explicitly (in the third example)\n     link up the taking of the lie detector test to allowing the\n     accused to go free.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_273\">                               227</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_325\">\f204. We can also contemplate a possibility that even when an\n\nindividual freely consents to undergo the tests in question, the\n\nresulting   testimony   cannot    be   readily   characterised   as\n\nvoluntary in nature. This is attributable to the differences\n\nbetween the manner in which the impugned tests are\n\nconducted and an ordinary interrogation. In an ordinary\n\ninterrogation, the investigator asks questions one by one and\n\nthe subject has the choice of remaining silent or answering\n\neach of these questions. This choice is repeatedly exercised\n\nafter each question is asked and the subject decides the\n\nnature and content of each testimonial response. On account\n\nof the continuous exercise of such a choice, the subject&#x27;s\n\nverbal responses can be described as voluntary in nature.\n\nHowever, in the context of the impugned techniques the test\n\nsubject does not exercise such a choice in a continuous\n\nmanner. After the initial consent is given, the subject has no\n\nconscious control over the subsequent responses given during\n\nthe test. In case of the narcoanalysis technique, the subject\n\nspeaks in a drug-induced state and is clearly not aware of\n\nhis/her own responses at the time. In the context of polygraph\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_274\">                                 228</span>\n\fexamination and the BEAP tests, the subject cannot anticipate\n\nthe contents of the `relevant questions&#x27; that will be asked or\n\nthe `probes&#x27; that will be shown. Furthermore, the results are\n\nderived from the measurement of physiological responses and\n\nhence the subject cannot exercise an effective choice between\n\nremaining silent and imparting personal knowledge. In light of\n\nthese facts, it was contended that a presumption cannot be\n\nmade about the voluntariness of the test results even if the\n\nsubject had given prior consent. In this respect, we can re-\n\nemphasize Principle 6 and 21 of the Body of Principles for the\n\nProtection of all persons under any form of Detention or\n\nImprisonment (1988). The explanation to Principle 6 provides\n\nthat:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_187\">        &quot;The term `cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or\n        punishment&#x27; should be interpreted so as to extend the\n        widest possible protection against abuses, whether\n        physical or mental, including the holding of a detained or\n        imprisoned person in conditions which deprive him,\n        temporarily or permanently, of the use of any of his\n        natural senses, such as sight or hearing, or of his\n        awareness of place and the passing of time.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_326\">Furthermore, Principle 21(2) lays down that:\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_275\">                                 229</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_188\">\f       &quot;No detained person while being interrogated shall be\n       subjected to violence, threats or methods of interrogation\n       which impair his capacity of decision or judgment.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_327\">205. It is undeniable that during a narcoanalysis interview,\n\nthe test subject does lose `awareness of place and passing of\n\ntime&#x27;. It is also quite evident that all the three impugned\n\ntechniques can be described as methods of interrogation\n\nwhich impair the test subject&#x27;s `capacity of decision or\n\njudgment&#x27;. Going by the language of these principles, we hold\n\nthat    the   compulsory     administration   of   the   impugned\n\ntechniques     constitutes    `cruel,   inhuman    or    degrading\n\ntreatment&#x27; in the context of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_354\">Article 21.</a> It must be remembered\n\nthat the law disapproves of involuntary testimony, irrespective\n\nof the nature and degree of coercion, threats, fraud or\n\ninducement used to elicit the same. The popular perceptions\n\nof terms such as `torture&#x27; and `cruel, inhuman or degrading\n\ntreatment&#x27; are associated with gory images of blood-letting and\n\nbroken bones. However, we must recognise that a forcible\n\nintrusion into a person&#x27;s mental processes is also an affront to\n\nhuman dignity and liberty, often with grave and long-lasting\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_276\">                                 230</span>\n\fconsequences. [A similar conclusion has been made in the\n\nfollowing paper: Marcy Strauss, `Criminal Defence in the Age\n\nof Terrorism - Torture&#x27;, 48 New York Law School Law Review\n\n201-274 (2003/2004)]\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_328\">206. It would also be wrong to sustain a comparison between\n\nthe forensic uses of these techniques and the practice of\n\nmedicine. It has been suggested that patients undergo a\n\ncertain degree of `physical or mental pain and suffering&#x27; on\n\naccount of medical interventions such as surgeries and drug-\n\ntreatments. However, such interventions are acceptable since\n\nthe objective is to ultimately cure or prevent a disease or\n\ndisorder. So it is argued that if the infliction of some `pain and\n\nsuffering&#x27; is permitted in the medical field, it should also be\n\ntolerated for the purpose of expediting investigations in\n\ncriminal cases. This is the point where our constitutional\n\nvalues step in. A society governed by rules and liberal values\n\nmakes    a    rational   distinction    between    the    various\n\ncircumstances where individuals face pain and suffering.\n\nWhile the infliction of a certain degree of pain and suffering is\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_277\">                               231</span>\n\fmandated by law in the form of punishments for various\n\noffences, the same cannot be extended to all those who are\n\nquestioned during the course of an investigation. Allowing the\n\nsame would vest unlimited discretion and lead to the\n\ndisproportionate exercise of police powers.\n\n\n\nIncompatibility with the `Right to fair trial&#x27;\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_329\">207. The respondents&#x27; position is that the compulsory\n\nadministration    of   the   impugned    techniques   should   be\n\npermitted at least for investigative purposes, and if the test\n\nresults lead to the discovery of fresh evidence, then these\n\nfruits should be admissible. We have already explained in light\n\nof the conjunctive reading of <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_355\">Article 20(3)</a> of the Constitution\n\nand <a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_356\">Section 27</a> of the Evidence Act, that if the fact of\n\ncompulsion is proved, the test results will not be admissible as\n\nevidence. However, for the sake of argument, if we were to\n\nagree with the respondents and allow investigators to compel\n\nindividuals to undergo these tests, it would also affect some of\n\nthe key components of the `right to fair trial&#x27;.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_278\">                                232</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_330\">\f<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"501198\" id=\"span_279\">208. The decision of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/501198/\" id=\"a_357\">D.K. Basu v. State of West\n\nBengal</a>, AIR 1997 SC 610, had stressed upon the entitlement\n\nof a person in custody to consult a lawyer. Access to legal\n\nadvice is an essential safeguard so that an individual can be\n\nadequately apprised of his constitutional and statutory rights.\n\nThis is also a measure which checks custodial abuses.\n\nHowever, the involuntary administration of any of the\n\nimpugned tests can lead to a situation where such legal advice\n\nbecomes ineffective. For instance even if a person receives the\n\nbest of legal advice before undergoing any of these tests, it\n\ncannot prevent the extraction of information which may prove\n\nto be inculpatory by itself or lead to the subsequent discovery\n\nof incriminating materials. Since the subject has no conscious\n\ncontrol over the drug-induced revelations or substantive\n\ninferences, the objective of providing access to legal advice are\n\nfrustrated.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_331\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_332\">209. Since the subject is not immediately aware of the\n\ncontents of the drug-induced revelations or substantive\n\ninferences, it also conceivable that the investigators may chose\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_280\">                               233</span>\n\fnot to communicate them to the subject even after completing\n\nthe tests. In fact statements may be recorded or charges\n\nframed without the knowledge of the test subject. At the stage\n\nof trial, the prosecution is obliged to supply copies of all\n\nincriminating materials to the defendant but reliance on the\n\nimpugned tests could curtail the opportunity of presenting a\n\nmeaningful and wholesome defence. If the contents of the\n\nrevelations or inferences are communicated much later to the\n\ndefendant, there may not be sufficient time to prepare an\n\nadequate defence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_333\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_334\">210. Earlier in this judgment, we had surveyed some foreign\n\njudicial precedents dealing with each of the tests in question.\n\nA common concern expressed with regard to each of these\n\ntechniques was the questionable reliability of the results\n\ngenerated by them. In respect of the narcoanalysis technique,\n\nit was observed that there is no guarantee that the drug-\n\ninduced revelations will be truthful. Furthermore, empirical\n\nstudies   have   shown   that    during   the   hypnotic   stage,\n\nindividuals are prone to suggestibility and there is a good\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_281\">                                234</span>\n\fchance that false results could lead to a finding of guilt or\n\ninnocence. As far as polygraph examination is concerned,\n\nthough there are some studies showing improvements in the\n\naccuracy of results with advancement in technology, there is\n\nalways     scope   for   error   on    account     of   several        factors.\n\nObjections can be raised about the qualifications of the\n\nexaminer, the physical conditions under which the test was\n\nconducted, the manner in which questions were framed and\n\nthe possible use of `countermeasures&#x27; by the test subject. A\n\nsignificant criticism of polygraphy is that sometimes the\n\nphysiological responses triggered by feelings such as anxiety\n\nand fear could be misread as those triggered by deception.\n\nSimilarly, with the P300 Waves test there are inherent\n\nlimitations such as the subject having had `prior exposure&#x27; to\n\nthe `probes&#x27; which are used as stimuli. Furthermore, this\n\ntechnique has not been the focus of rigorous independent\n\nstudies.    The    questionable       scientific   reliability    of     these\n\ntechniques comes into conflict with the standard of proof\n\n`beyond reasonable doubt&#x27; which is an essential feature of\n\ncriminal trials.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_335\">\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_282\">                                  235</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_336\">\f211. Another factor that merits attention is the role of the\n\nexperts who administer these tests. While the consideration of\n\nexpert opinion testimony has become a mainstay in our\n\ncriminal justice system with the advancement of fields such as\n\nforensic toxicology, questions have been raised about the\n\ncredibility of experts who are involved in administering the\n\nimpugned techniques. It is a widely accepted principle for\n\nevaluating the validity of any scientific technique that it\n\nshould have been subjected to rigorous independent studies\n\nand peer review. This is so because the persons who are\n\ninvolved   in   the   invention    and   development   of   certain\n\ntechniques are perceived to have           an interest in their\n\npromotion. Hence, it is quite likely that such persons may give\n\nunduly favourable responses about the reliability of the\n\ntechniques in question.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_337\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_338\">212. Even though India does not have a jury system, the use\n\nof the impugned techniques could impede the fact-finding role\n\nof a trial judge. This is a special concern in our legal system,\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_283\">                                  236</span>\n\fsince the same judge presides over the evidentiary phase of\n\nthe trial as well as the guilt phase. The consideration of the\n\ntest results or their fruits for the purpose of deciding on their\n\nadmissibility could have a prejudicial effect on the judge&#x27;s\n\nmind even if the same are not eventually admitted as evidence.\n\nFurthermore, we echo the concerns expressed by the Supreme\n\nCourt of Canada in R v. Beland, [1987] 36 C.C.C. (3d) 481,\n\nwhere it was observed that reliance on scientific techniques\n\ncould cloud human judgment on account of an `aura of\n\ninfallibility&#x27;. While judges are expected to be impartial and\n\nobjective in their evaluation of evidence, one can never\n\ndiscount the possibility of undue public pressure in some\n\ncases,    especially   when    the    test   results   appear     to    be\n\ninculpatory.    We     have   already     expressed    concerns        with\n\nsituations where media organisations have either circulated\n\nthe      video-recordings     of     narcoanalysis     interviews        or\n\nbroadcasted      dramatized        re-constructions,   especially        in\n\nsensational criminal cases.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_339\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_284\">                                    237</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_340\">\f213. Another important consideration is that of ensuring\n\nparity between the procedural safeguards that are available to\n\nthe prosecution and the defence. If we were to permit the\n\ncompulsory administration of any of the impugned techniques\n\nat the behest of investigators, there would be no principled\n\nbasis to deny the same opportunity to defendants as well as\n\nwitnesses. If the investigators could justify reliance on these\n\ntechniques, there would be an equally compelling reason to\n\nallow the indiscrete administration of these tests at the\n\nrequest of convicts who want re-opening of their cases or even\n\nfor the purpose of attacking and rehabilitating the credibility\n\nof witnesses during a trial. The decision in United States v.\n\nScheffer, 523 US 303 (1998), has highlighted the concerns\n\nwith encouraging litigation that is collateral to the main facts\n\nin issue. We are of the view that an untrammelled right of\n\nresorting to the techniques in question will lead to an\n\nunnecessary rise in the volume of frivolous litigation before\n\nour Courts.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_341\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_285\">                              238</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_342\">\f214. Lastly, we must consider the possibility that the victims\n\nof offences could be forcibly subjected to any of these\n\ntechniques during the course of investigation. We have already\n\nhighlighted a provision in the Laboratory Procedure Manual for\n\nPolygraph tests which contemplates the same for ascertaining\n\nthe testimony of victims of sexual offences. In light of the\n\npreceding discussion, it is our view that irrespective of the\n\nneed to expedite investigations in such cases, no person who\n\nis a victim of an offence can be compelled to undergo any of\n\nthe tests in question. Such a forcible administration would be\n\nan unjustified intrusion into mental privacy and could lead to\n\nfurther stigma for the victim.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_343\">\n\nExamining the `compelling public interest&#x27;\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_344\">215. The respondents have contended that even if the\n\ncompulsory    administration     of    the   impugned   techniques\n\namounts to a seemingly disproportionate intrusion into\n\npersonal liberty, their investigative use is justifiable since\n\nthere is a compelling public interest in eliciting information\n\nthat could help in preventing criminal activities in the future.\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_286\">                                 239</span>\n\fSuch utilitarian considerations hold some significance in light\n\nof the need to combat terrorist activities, insurgencies and\n\norganised crime. It has been argued that such exigencies\n\njustify some intrusions into civil liberties. The textual basis for\n\nthese restraints could be grounds such as preserving the\n\n`sovereignty and integrity of India&#x27;, `the security of the state&#x27;\n\nand `public order&#x27; among others. It was suggested that if\n\ninvestigators are allowed to rely on these tests, the results\n\ncould help in uncovering plots, apprehending suspects and\n\npreventing armed attacks as well as the commission of\n\noffences. Reference was also made to the frequently discussed\n\n`Ticking Bomb&#x27; scenario. This hypothetical situation examines\n\nthe choices available to investigators when they have reason to\n\nbelieve that the person whom they are interrogating is aware\n\nof the location of a bomb. The dilemma is whether it is\n\njustifiable to use torture or other improper means for eliciting\n\ninformation which could help in saving the lives of ordinary\n\ncitizens. [The arguments for the use of `truth serums&#x27; in such\n\nsituations have been examined in the following articles: Jason\n\nR. Odeshoo, `Truth or Dare?: Terrorism and Truth Serum in\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_287\">                                240</span>\n\fthe Post- 9/11 World, 57 Stanford Law Review 209-255\n\n(October 2004); Kenneth Lasson, `Torture, Truth Serum, and\n\nTicking Bombs: Toward a pragmatic perspective on coercive\n\ninterrogation&#x27;, 39 Loyola University Chicago Law Journal 329-\n\n360 (Winter 2008)]\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_345\">216. While these arguments merit consideration, it must be\n\nnoted that ordinarily it is the task of the legislature to arrive at\n\na pragmatic balance between the often competing interests of\n\n`personal liberty&#x27; and public safety. In our capacity as a\n\nconstitutional court, we can only seek to preserve the balance\n\nbetween these competing interests as reflected in the text of\n\nthe Constitution and its subsequent interpretation. There is\n\nabsolutely no ambiguity on the status of principles such as\n\nthe   `right   against   self-incrimination&#x27;   and    the   various\n\ndimensions of `personal liberty&#x27;. We have already pointed out\n\nthat the rights guaranteed in <a href=\"/doc/655638/\" id=\"a_358\">Articles 20</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_359\">21</a> of the\n\nConstitution of India have been given a non-derogable status\n\nand they are available to citizens as well as foreigners. It is not\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_288\">                                241</span>\n\fwithin the competence of the judiciary to create exceptions\n\nand limitations on the availability of these rights.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_346\">217. Even though the main task of constitutional adjudication\n\nis to safeguard the core organising principles of our polity, we\n\nmust also highlight some practical concerns that strengthen\n\nthe case against the involuntary administration of the tests in\n\nquestion.   Firstly, the claim that the results obtained from\n\nthese techniques will help in extraordinary situations is\n\nquestionable. All of the tests in question are those which need\n\nto be patiently administered and the forensic psychologist or\n\nthe examiner has to be very skilful and thorough while\n\ninterpreting the results. In a narcoanalysis test the subject is\n\nlikely to divulge a lot of irrelevant and incoherent information.\n\nThe subject is as likely to divulge false information as he/she\n\nis likely to reveal useful facts. Sometimes the revelations may\n\nbegin to make sense only when compared with the testimony\n\nof several other individuals or through the discovery of fresh\n\nmaterials. In a polygraph test, interpreting the results is a\n\ncomplex process that involves accounting for distortions such\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_289\">                               242</span>\n\fas `countermeasures&#x27; used by the subject and weather\n\nconditions among others. In a BEAP test, there is always the\n\npossibility of the subject having had prior exposure to the\n\n`probes&#x27; that are used as stimuli. All of this is a gradually\n\nunfolding process and it is not appropriate to argue that the\n\ntest results will always prove to be crucial in times of exigency.\n\nIt is evident that both the tasks of preparing for these tests\n\nand interpreting their results need considerable time and\n\nexpertise.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_347\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_348\">218. Secondly, if we were to permit the forcible administration\n\nof these techniques, it could be the first step on a very\n\nslippery-slope as far as the standards of police behaviour are\n\nconcerned. In some of the impugned judgments, it has been\n\nsuggested that the promotion of these techniques could reduce\n\nthe regrettably high incidence of `third degree methods&#x27; that\n\nare being used by policemen all over the country. This is a\n\ncircular line of reasoning since one form of improper behaviour\n\nis sought to be replaced by another. What this will result in is\n\nthat investigators will increasingly seek reliance on the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_290\">                               243</span>\n\fimpugned techniques rather than engaging in a thorough\n\ninvestigation.   The    widespread     use    of   `third-degree&#x27;\n\ninterrogation methods so as to speak is a separate problem\n\nand needs to be tackled through long-term solutions such as\n\nmore emphasis on the protection of human rights during\n\npolice training, providing adequate resources for investigators\n\nand stronger accountability measures when such abuses do\n\ntake place.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_349\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_350\">219. Thirdly, the claim that the use of these techniques will\n\nonly be sought in cases involving heinous offences rings\n\nhollow since there will no principled basis for restricting their\n\nuse once the investigators are given the discretion to do so.\n\nFrom the statistics presented before us as well as the charges\n\nfiled against the parties in the impugned judgments, it is\n\nobvious that investigators have sought reliance on the\n\nimpugned tests to expedite investigations, unmindful of the\n\nnature of offences involved. In this regard, we do not have the\n\nauthority to permit the qualified use of these techniques by\n\nway of enumerating the offences which warrant their use. By\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_291\">                               244</span>\n\fitself, permitting such qualified use would amount to a law-\n\nmaking function which is clearly outside the judicial domain.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_351\">220. One of the main functions of constitutionally prescribed\n\nrights is to safeguard the interests of citizens in their\n\ninteractions with the government. As the guardians of these\n\nrights, we will be failing in our duty if we permit any citizen to\n\nbe forcibly subjected to the tests in question. One could argue\n\nthat some of the parties who will benefit from this decision are\n\nhardened criminals who have no regard for societal values.\n\nHowever, it must be borne in mind that in constitutional\n\nadjudication our concerns are not confined to the facts at\n\nhand but extend to the implications of our decision for the\n\nwhole population as well as the future generations. Sometimes\n\nthere are apprehensions about judges imposing their personal\n\nsensibilities   through     broadly        worded   terms   such   as\n\n`substantive due process&#x27;, but in this case our inquiry has\n\nbeen   based    on   a    faithful     understanding   of   principles\n\nentrenched in our Constitution. In this context it would be\n\nuseful to refer to some observations made by the Supreme\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_292\">                                     245</span>\n\fCourt of Israel in Public Committee Against Torture in\n\nIsrael v. State of Israel, H.C. 5100 / 94 (1999), where it was\n\nheld that the use of physical means (such as shaking the\n\nsuspect,   sleep-deprivation   and    enforcing   uncomfortable\n\npositions for prolonged     periods) during interrogation      of\n\nterrorism suspects was illegal. Among other questions raised\n\nin that case, it was also held that the `necessity&#x27; defence could\n\nbe used only as a post factum justification for past conduct\n\nand that it could not be the basis of a blanket pre-emptive\n\npermission for coercive interrogation practices in the future.\n\nRuling against such methods, Aharon Barak, J. held at p. 26:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_189\">     &quot;... This is the destiny of democracy, as not all means are\n     acceptable to it, and not all practices employed by its\n     enemies are open before it. Although a democracy must\n     often fight with one hand tied behind its back, it\n     nonetheless has the upper hand. Preserving the `Rule of\n     Law&#x27; and recognition of an individual&#x27;s liberty constitutes\n     an important component in its understanding of\n     security.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_352\">CONCLUSION\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_353\">221. In our considered opinion, the compulsory administration\n\nof the impugned techniques violates the `right against self-\n\nincrimination&#x27;. This is because the underlying rationale of the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_293\">                               246</span>\n\fsaid right is to ensure the reliability as well as voluntariness of\n\nstatements that are admitted as evidence. This Court has\n\nrecognised that the protective scope of <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_360\">Article 20(3)</a> extends to\n\nthe investigative stage in criminal cases and when read with\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1110422/\" id=\"a_361\">Section 161(2)</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 it\n\nprotects accused persons, suspects as well as witnesses who\n\nare examined during an investigation. The test results cannot\n\nbe admitted in evidence if they have been obtained through\n\nthe use of compulsion. <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_362\">Article 20(3)</a> protects an individual&#x27;s\n\nchoice between speaking and remaining silent, irrespective of\n\nwhether the subsequent testimony proves to be inculpatory or\n\nexculpatory.    <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_363\">Article 20(3)</a> aims to prevent the forcible\n\n`conveyance of personal knowledge that is relevant to the facts\n\nin issue&#x27;. The results obtained from each of the impugned tests\n\nbear a `testimonial&#x27; character and they cannot be categorised\n\nas material evidence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_354\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_355\">222. We are also of the view that forcing an individual to\n\nundergo any of the impugned techniques violates the standard\n\nof `substantive due process&#x27; which is required for restraining\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_294\">                                247</span>\n\fpersonal liberty. Such a violation will occur irrespective of\n\nwhether these techniques are forcibly administered during the\n\ncourse of an investigation or for any other purpose since the\n\ntest   results   could        also   expose         a   person        to    adverse\n\nconsequences      of     a     non-penal           nature.     The     impugned\n\ntechniques cannot be read into the statutory provisions which\n\nenable medical examination during investigation in criminal\n\ncases, i.e. the Explanation to <a href=\"/doc/633996/\" id=\"a_364\">Sections 53</a>, <a href=\"/doc/125412981/\" id=\"a_365\">53-A</a> and <a href=\"/doc/441720/\" id=\"a_366\">54</a> of the\n\nCode of Criminal Procedure, 1973. Such an expansive\n\ninterpretation is not feasible in light of the rule of `ejusdem\n\ngeneris&#x27;   and     the        considerations            which     govern         the\n\ninterpretation    of         statutes         in    relation     to        scientific\n\nadvancements. We have also elaborated how the compulsory\n\nadministration of any of these techniques is an unjustified\n\nintrusion into the mental privacy of an individual. It would\n\nalso amount to `cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment&#x27; with\n\nregard to the language of evolving international human rights\n\nnorms. Furthermore, placing reliance on the results gathered\n\nfrom these techniques comes into conflict with the `right to fair\n\ntrial&#x27;. Invocations of a compelling public interest cannot justify\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_295\">                                        248</span>\n\fthe dilution of constitutional rights such as the `right against\n\nself-incrimination&#x27;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_356\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_357\">223. In light of these conclusions, we hold that no individual\n\nshould be forcibly subjected to any of the techniques in\n\nquestion, whether in the context of investigation in criminal\n\ncases or otherwise. Doing so would amount to an unwarranted\n\nintrusion into personal liberty. However, we do leave room for\n\nthe voluntary administration of the impugned techniques in\n\nthe   context   of     criminal   justice,     provided    that   certain\n\nsafeguards are in place. Even when the subject has given\n\nconsent to undergo any of these tests, the test results by\n\nthemselves cannot be admitted as evidence because the\n\nsubject does not exercise conscious control over the responses\n\nduring   the    administration      of   the     test.    However,   any\n\ninformation or material that is subsequently discovered with\n\nthe help of voluntary administered test results can be\n\nadmitted, in accordance with <a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_367\">Section 27</a> of the Evidence Act,\n\n1872. The National Human Rights Commission had published\n\n`Guidelines for the Administration of Polygraph Test (Lie\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_296\">                                  249</span>\n\fDetector Test) on an Accused&#x27; in 2000.
