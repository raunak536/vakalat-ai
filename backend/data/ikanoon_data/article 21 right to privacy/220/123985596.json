Background\n\n\n1.   Leave granted.\n\n2.   This appeal arises out of the judgment of a Division Bench of the High Court\n\n     of Delhi dated 15 July 2022. The appellant invoked the writ jurisdiction of the\n\n     High Court seeking its permission to terminate her pregnancy before the\n\n     completion of twenty-four weeks on 15 July 2022. Other ancillary reliefs were\n\n     sought. For convenience of reference, the reliefs claimed before the High\n\n     Court are extracted below:\n\n\n             “A. Permit the Petitioner to terminate her ongoing\n             pregnancy through registered medical practitioners at any\n             approved private or government center or Hospital before\n             15.07.2022 as her relief will be infructuous after that as the\n             pregnancy will be of around 24 Weeks by that time;\n\n             B. Restrain the Respondent from taking any coercive\n             action or criminal proceedings against the Petitioner or any\n             Registered Medical Practitioner terminating the pregnancy\n             of the petitioner at any approved private center or hospital\n             registered by Govt NCT of Delhi;\n\n             C. Direct the Respondent to include unmarried woman\n             also within the ambit of the Rule 3B of the Medical\n             Termination of Pregnancy Rules 2003 (as amended on\n             21.10.2021) for termination of pregnancy under clause (b)\n             of sub-section (2) <a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 3</a> of the MTP Act, for a period of\n             up to twenty-four weeks;\n\n             D. Order an immediate Interim Relief of Stay during the\n             course of proceedings”\n\n\n\n3.    The appellant is an Indian citizen and a permanent resident of Manipur. She\n\nis currently residing in New Delhi. The appellant averred that she is the eldest\n\namongst five siblings and that her parents are agriculturists. At the time of the\n\n\n\n\n                                               4\n\f                                                                             PART A\n\ninstitution of the Writ Petition before the High Court of Delhi, 1 the appellant was\n\ncarrying a single intrauterine pregnancy corresponding to a gestational age of\n\ntwenty-two weeks. The appellant is an unmarried woman aged about twenty-five\n\nyears, and had become pregnant as a result of a consensual relationship. The\n\nappellant wished to terminate her pregnancy as “her partner had refused to marry\n\nher at the last stage.” She stated that she did not want to carry the pregnancy to\n\nterm since she was wary of the “social stigma and harassment” pertaining to\n\nunmarried single parents, especially women. Moreover, the appellant submitted\n\nthat in the absence of a source of livelihood, she was not mentally prepared to\n\n“raise and nurture the child as an unmarried mother.” The appellant stated that the\n\ncontinuation of the unwanted pregnancy would involve a risk of grave and immense\n\ninjury to her mental health.\n\n\n4.      The appellant sought permission to terminate her pregnancy in terms of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/312960/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 3(2)(b)</a> of the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act 1971 2 and Rule 3B(c)\n\nof the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Rules 2003 3 (as amended on 12 October\n\n2021). The appellant instituted a Criminal Miscellaneous Application 4 for grant of\n\ninterim relief to terminate her pregnancy during the pendency of the Writ Petition.\n\n\n5.      By its order dated 15 July 2022, the High Court issued notice restricted only\n\nto prayer C of the Writ Petition, and rejected the Criminal Miscellaneous\n\nApplication, effectively rejecting prayers A and B. The High Court observed that\n\n<a href=\"/doc/312960/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 3(2)(b)</a> of the MTP Act was inapplicable to the facts of the present case\n\n\n\n1 WP(C) 10602/2022\n2 “<a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_8\">MTP Act</a>”\n3 “MTP Rules”\n4 CM Application 30708/2022\n\n\n\n                                          5\n\f                                                                                PART A\n\nsince the appellant, being an unmarried woman, whose pregnancy arose out of a\n\nconsensual relationship, was not covered by any of the sub-clauses of Rule 3B of\n\nthe MTP Rules. The High Court held that:\n\n\n               “8. The Petitioner, who is an unmarried woman and whose\n               pregnancy arises out of a consensual relationship, is\n               clearly not covered by any of the Clauses under the\n               Medical Termination of Pregnancy Rules, 2003. Therefore,\n               <a href=\"/doc/312960/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 3(2)(b)</a> of the Act is not applicable to the facts of\n               this case.\n\n               9. Learned counsel for the Petitioner states that Rule 3B of\n               the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Rules, 2003 is\n               violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_10\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India, 1950,\n               inasmuch as it excludes an unmarried woman. Whether\n               such rule is valid or not can be decided only after the said\n               rule is held ultra vires, for which purpose, notice has to be\n               issued in the writ petition and has been done so by this\n               Court.\n\n               10. As of today, Rule 3B of the Medical Termination of\n               Pregnancy Rules, 2003, stands, and this Court, while\n               exercising its power under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_11\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution\n               of India, 1950, cannot go beyond the Statute. Granting\n               interim relief now would amount to allowing the writ petition\n               itself.”\n\n6.       The order of the High Court gave rise to the present appeal. Notice was\n\nissued on the Petition for Special Leave to Appeal on 21 July 2022. This Court, by\n\nits order dated 21 July 2022 modified the order of the High Court and permitted the\n\nappellant to terminate her pregnancy. This Court passed the following ad interim\n\norder:\n\n\n               “22. In the above background, we pass the following ad\n               interim order:\n\n               (i) We request the Director of the All India Institute of\n               Medical Sciences, Delhi to constitute a Medical Board in\n               terms of the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/199658711/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 3(2D)</a> of the Act,\n               extracted in the earlier part of this order, during the course\n               of 22 July 2022; and\n\n\n\n                                                 6\n\f                                                                                 PART B\n\n                   (ii) In the event that the Medical Board concludes that the\n                   fetus can be aborted without danger to the life of the\n                   petitioner, a team of doctors at the All India Institute of\n                   Medical Sciences shall carry out the abortion in terms of\n                   the request which has been made before the High Court\n                   and which has been reiterated both in the Special Leave\n                   Petition and in the course of the submissions before this\n                   Court by counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner.\n                   Before doing so the wishes of the petitioner shall be\n                   ascertained again and her written consent obtained after\n                   due verification of identity.”\n\n7.        Counsel for the petitioner and the respondent stated that a Medical Board\n\nwas constituted at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences. 5 The Board noted\n\nthat the petitioner had consented to the termination of her pregnancy and the\n\nprocedure could be undertaken without danger to her life. The report submitted by\n\nAIIMS indicates that the termination of the pregnancy was safely carried out.\n\n\n8.        As the case involves a substantial question of law, this Court has taken it up\n\nfor further consideration. The Writ Petition before the Delhi High Court shall stand\n\ntransferred to this Court. The significant issue which comes up for determination in\n\nthis appeal turns on the interpretation of Rule 3B of the MTP Rules.\n\n\nB.       Submissions\n\n\n9.        Dr. Amit Mishra, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant made\n\nthe following submissions:\n\n\n              a.   The appellant was an unmarried woman whose partner had refused\n\n                   to marry her. She did not wish to continue the pregnancy and have\n\n                   the child out of wedlock as she lacked the financial resources to do\n\n                   so. She was not employed and her parents were farmers;\n\n5   “AIIMS”\n\n                                                   7\n\f                                                                               PART B\n\n        b.   She was also not mentally prepared to raise a child by herself. If she\n\n             was compelled to do so, it would cause grave injury to her physical\n\n             and mental health. The appellant was not prepared to face the social\n\n             stigma surrounding unwed mothers; and\n\n        c.   <a href=\"/doc/312960/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 3(2)(b)</a> of the MTP Act and Rule 3B of the MTP Rules are\n\n             arbitrary and discriminatory because they exclude unmarried women\n\n             from their ambit. They discriminate against women on the ground of\n\n             marital status, in violation of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_14\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution.\n\n\n10.   Ms. Aishwarya Bhati, learned senior counsel and Additional Solicitor\n\nGeneral has ably assisted this Court in the interpretation of <a href=\"/doc/357331/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 3(2)</a> of the MTP\n\nAct and Rule 3B(c) of the MTP Rules. She made the following submissions in\n\nsupport of the argument that Rule 3B(c) extends to unmarried or single women\n\nwho are in long-term relationships:\n\n\n        a.   The interpretation of legislation must be guided by the text and context\n\n             of a statute as well as the object it seeks to achieve. The Statement\n\n             of Objects and Reasons of a statute must also guide its interpretation;\n\n        b.   Modern legislations ought to be read in view of the evolution of society\n\n             from the time of enactment. The literal construction of beneficial\n\n             legislations must be avoided, and they ought to be given a purposive\n\n             interpretation;\n\n        c.   A subordinate legislation should give effect to the statute it is enacted\n\n             under. If two constructions are possible, the interpretation in\n\n             consonance with the statutory scheme ought to be adopted;\n\n\n\n                                           8\n\f                                                                             PART C\n\n        d.   The term “change of marital status” in Rule 3B(c) ought to be\n\n             interpreted as “change in the status of a relationship” to include\n\n             unmarried or single women as well as women who are not divorced\n\n             but are separated or have been deserted;\n\n        e.   “Live-in relationships” are equivalent to marital relationships because\n\n             in both types of relationships, the woman is entitled to maintenance.\n\n             Further, the children born out of such a relationship are vested with\n\n             the right of succession. Various national legislations, including the\n\n             <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_16\">MTP Act</a>, do not make a distinction between married women and\n\n             unmarried or single women; and\n\n        f.   Women enjoy the right to bodily integrity and autonomy, as well as\n\n             reproductive rights. They are entitled to exercise decisional\n\n             autonomy.\n\n\n<a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_17\">C.    The Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act</a> 1971 and the rules framed\n\n      thereunder\n\n\n11.    Before we embark upon a discussion on the law and its application, it must\n\nbe mentioned that we use the term “woman” in this judgment as including persons\n\nother than cis-gender women who may require access to safe medical termination\n\nof their pregnancies.\n\n\n12.    In India, termination of pregnancies is to be done strictly in terms of the <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_18\">MTP\n\nAct</a>. The preamble of the <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_19\">MTP Act</a> states that it is an “Act to provide for the\n\ntermination of certain pregnancies by registered medical practitioners and for\n\nmatters connected therewith or incidental thereto.” <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_20\">The MTP Act</a> specifies the\n\n\n                                          9\n\f                                                                                    PART C\n\nrequirements to be fulfilled for terminating a pregnancy, including the persons who\n\nare competent to perform the termination procedure, circumstances when abortion\n\nis permissible, and places where the procedure may be performed.\n\n\n13.       <a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 3</a> of the MTP Act, as amended by the <a href=\"/doc/1834371/\" id=\"a_22\">Medical Termination of\n\nPregnancy (Amendment) Act</a> 2021 (8 of 2021), 6 provides for when pregnancies\n\nmay be terminated:\n\n\n                 “<a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 3</a> - When pregnancies may be terminated by\n                 registered medical practitioners\n\n                 (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_24\">Indian Penal\n                 Code</a> (45 of 1860), a registered medical practitioner shall\n                 not be guilty of any offence under that code or under any\n                 other law for the time being in force, if any pregnancy is\n                 terminated by him in accordance with the provisions of this\n                 Act.\n\n                 2[(2) Subject to the provisions of sub-section (4), a\n                 pregnancy may be terminated by a registered medical\n                 practitioner,--\n\n                 (a) where the length of the pregnancy does not exceed\n                 twenty weeks, if such medical practitioner is, or\n\n                 (b) where the length of the pregnancy exceeds twenty\n                 weeks but does not exceed twenty-four weeks in case of\n                 such category of woman as may be prescribed by rules\n                 made under this Act, if not less than two registered medical\n                 practitioners are, of the opinion, formed in good faith, that-\n                 -\n</pre>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_1\">                 (i) the continuance of the pregnancy would involve a risk\n                 to the life of the pregnant woman or of grave injury to her\n                 physical or mental health;

Despite the enactment of the <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_59\">MTP Act</a>, a number of hurdles continue to\n\nprevent full access to safe and legal abortions, pushing women to avail of\n\nclandestine, unsafe abortions. These barriers include insufficient infrastructural\n\nfacilities, a lack of awareness, social stigma, and failure to ensure confidential care.\n\nIn some situations, unmarried women face particular barriers due to gender\n\nstereotypes about women’s sexual autonomy outside marriage. These barriers are\n\na serious impediment and deter single women from seeking safe and legal\n\nabortions. Such barriers may contribute to a delay in accessing abortion services\n\nor a complete denial of such services, consequently negating women’s right to\n\nreproductive autonomy.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_14\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_15\">      i.      RMPs’ fear of prosecution\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_16\">19.        It is not only the factors mentioned above which hinder access to safe\n\nabortion but also a fear of prosecution under the country’s criminal laws. Under the\n\ncurrent legal framework, the <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_60\">MTP Act</a> merely lays out exceptions to the provisions\n\ncriminalizing abortion in <a href=\"/doc/1990693/\" id=\"a_61\">Sections 312</a> to <a href=\"/doc/1173112/\" id=\"a_62\">318</a> of the IPC. <a href=\"/doc/1331665/\" id=\"a_63\">Section 3(1)</a> of the MTP\n\nAct begins with a non-obstante clause and stipulates that “Notwithstanding\n\nanything contained in the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_64\">Indian Penal Code</a> (45 of 1860), a registered medical\n\npractitioner shall not be guilty of any offence under that Code or under any other\n\nlaw for the time being in force, if any pregnancy is terminated by him in accordance\n\nwith the provisions of this Act.” In terms of <a href=\"/doc/1331665/\" id=\"a_65\">Section 3(1)</a>, the termination of a\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                              16</span>\n\f                                                                                                PART D\n\npregnancy is a criminal offence under the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_66\">IPC</a>, unless it fulfils the conditions laid\n\ndown in the <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_67\">MTP Act</a>, including who can terminate a pregnancy, the place where\n\ntermination can take place, and the specific conditions in accordance with which\n\nsuch termination is permissible. <a href=\"/doc/771999/\" id=\"a_68\">Section 5(2)</a> provides penalties when termination\n\nof pregnancy is carried out by a person who is not an RMP. <a href=\"/doc/183951605/\" id=\"a_69\">Section 5(3)</a> provides\n\npenalties when termination of pregnancy is carried out in a place other than that\n\nmentioned in <a href=\"/doc/47920/\" id=\"a_70\">Section 4</a>. RMPs and women seeking termination of pregnancy are\n\nexempted from any legal action under the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_71\">IPC</a> mentioned above\n\nonly when these conditions are fulfilled.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_17\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_18\">20.     Presently, under the <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_72\">MTP Act</a>, the opinion of an RMP (in accordance with\n\nthe restrictions and grounds laid down in the Act) is decisive. It is on the basis of\n\nthe opinion formed by RMP(s), either under <a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_73\">Section 3</a> or under <a href=\"/doc/1891528/\" id=\"a_74\">Section 5</a>, that a\n\nwoman can terminate a pregnancy under the <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_75\">MTP Act</a>. This makes the <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_76\">MTP Act</a> a\n\nprovider-centric law. Since women’s right to access abortion is conditional on the\n\napproval by an RMP, the denial of services by an RMP compels women to\n\napproach courts or seek abortions in unsafe conditions. 24 A fear of prosecution\n\nunder this complex labyrinth of laws, including linking of the <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_77\">MTP Act</a> with the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_78\">IPC</a>,\n\nacts as a major barrier to safe abortion access, by having a chilling effect on the\n\nbehaviour of RMPs.

The fear faced by RMPs of prosecution under the penal provisions often\n\nleads to unnecessary delays. It is a common yet lamentable practice for RMPs to\n\ninsist on compliance with extra-legal conditions such as consent from the woman’s\n\nfamily, documentary proofs, or judicial authorisation. 27 If the woman fails to comply\n\nwith these additional requirements, RMPs frequently decline to provide their\n\nservices in conducting legal abortions.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_22\">\n26   (2018) 10 SCC 1\n27   Centre for Reproductive Rights, “Reform to Address Women’s and Girl’s need for Abortion after 20 weeks” (2018)\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                                         18</span>\n\f                                                                                                 PART D\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_23\">23.

According to the facts of the case, the accused\n\nwas in an “illicit relation” with the deceased, an unmarried woman of twenty-four\n\nyears. The deceased woman had become pregnant as a result of this relationship.\n\n\n31   (2000) 4 SCC 110\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">                                          20</span>\n\f                                                                             PART D\n\nBoth of them had approached the clinic of a so-called doctor (who was named as\n\na co-accused) to terminate the pregnancy of around 3 months (approximately 12\n\nweeks).

During the\n\nprocedure for the termination of pregnancy, the woman passed away.

The social stigma that women face for engaging in pre-marital sexual\n\nrelations prevents them from realizing their right to reproductive health in a variety\n\nof ways. They have insufficient or no access to knowledge about their own bodies\n\ndue to a lack of sexual health education, their access to contraceptives is limited,\n\nand they are frequently unable to approach healthcare providers and consult them\n\nwith respect to their reproductive health. Consequently, unmarried and single\n\nwomen face additional obstacles.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_34\">\n</p><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"422557\" id=\"span_26\"><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_35\">29.   The social stigma surrounding single women who are pregnant is even\n\ngreater and they often lack support from their family or partner. This leads to the\n\nproliferation of persons not qualified / certified to practice medicine. Such persons\n\noffer the possibility of a discreet abortion and many women may feel compelled by\n\ntheir circumstances to engage the services of such persons instead of opting for a\n\nmedically safe abortion. As illustrated in <a href=\"/doc/422557/\" id=\"a_105\">Surendra Chauhan</a> (supra), this often\n\nleads to disastrous consequences for the woman.

In Kanailal Sur v. Paramnidhi Sadhu Khan, 33 Gajendragadkar,\n\nJ. (as the learned Chief Justice then was) opined that “the first and primary rule of\n\nconstruction is that the intention of the Legislature must be found in the words used\n\nby the Legislature itself.” But when the words are capable of bearing two or more\n\nconstructions, they should be construed in light of the object and purpose of the\n\nenactment. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"30721\" id=\"span_28\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"311809\" id=\"span_29\">The purposive construction of the provision must be “illumined by the\n\ngoal, though guided by the word.”34 Aharon Barak opines that in certain\n\ncircumstances this may indicate giving “an unusual and exceptional meaning” to\n\nthe language and words used.35 Before we engage in the exercise of purposive\n\n\n32 JUSTICE G.P SINGH, G.P.

The courts must look to the object which the\n                statute seeks to achieve while interpreting any of the\n                provisions of the Act. A purposive approach for interpreting\n                the Act is necessary. We are unable to persuade ourselves\n                to agree with Mr Rao that it is only the property or valuable\n                security given at the time of marriage which would bring\n                the same within the definition of “dowry” punishable under\n                the Act, as such an interpretation would be defeating the\n                very object for which the Act was enacted. Keeping in view\n                the object of the Act, “demand of dowry” as a\n                consideration for a proposed marriage would also\n                come within the meaning of the expression dowry under\n                the Act.

Section 312 criminalizes abortion, making any person (including the\n\npregnant woman herself) liable for causing the miscarriage of a woman with an\n\nunborn foetus, except where the procedure is done in good faith in order to save\n\nthe woman’s life. Section 313 stipulates a penalty of imprisonment for life or\n\nimprisonment for a term which may extend to ten years when the offence of\n\n‘causing miscarriage’ is committed without the consent of the woman.

The continuing crisis\n\nof unsafe abortions looms large in the parliamentary history of the <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_175\">MTP Act</a> since\n\n1971. Unsafe abortions are a leading but preventable cause of maternal mortality\n\nand morbidity. However, despite the enactment of the <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_176\">MTP Act</a> in 1971, unsafe\n\nabortions continue to be the third leading cause of maternal mortality, and close to\n\neight women in India die each day due to causes related to unsafe abortions.66\n\nAnother study published in the BMJ Global Health points out to the grim statistics\n\nof unsafe abortions in India: between the years 2007 and 2011, an estimate of 67%\n\nof abortions carried out were classified as unsafe. 67 It further observes that\n\ndisadvantaged women in India, including women from a lower socio-economic\n\nstatus, are at a higher risk of undergoing unsafe abortions. By denying access to\n\nsafe abortion services, restrictive abortion laws have been shown to increase the\n\nincident of unsafe abortions. 68 In view of the serious social malady due to illegal\n\n\n\n65 Lok Sabha Debates, Seventeenth Series, at page 274\n66 United Nations Population Fund, “Seeing the Unseen: The case for action in the neglected crisis of unintended\npregnancy, State of World Populations” (2022)\n67 Ryo Yokoe, Choudhury SS, et al., Unsafe abortion and abortion-related death among 1.8 million women in India,\n\n4(3) BMJ Global Health (2019)\n68 Jonathan Baerak, et al., Unintended pregnancy and abortion by income, region, and the legal status of abortion:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_45\">estimates from a comprehensive model for 1990–2019, 8(9) Lancet Global Health (2020)\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_68\">                                                       38</span>\n\f                                                                                          PART E\n\nand unsafe abortions, the <a href=\"/doc/1834371/\" id=\"a_177\">MTP Amendment Act</a> 2021 intended to improve the\n\navailability and quality of legal abortion care for women by liberalizing certain\n\nrestrictive features of the unamended <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_178\">MTP Act</a> and by increasing the legal limit of\n\nthe gestational period within which abortions could be conducted from twenty to\n\ntwenty-four weeks.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_46\">       iv.   <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_179\">The MTP Act</a> as an aid of interpretation: Understanding “injury to\n\n             mental health”\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_47\">60.

The members of the Expert Committee suggested different\n\ncategories of women such as “survivors of sexual violence/ rape; mentally\n\nchallenged women, minors, women with disabilities; foetal anomalies; conception\n\n\n83   Judgment dated 6 October 2021 in WP(L) 21977 of 2021 (Bombay High Court)\n84   2020 SCC OnLine Bom 11672\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_96\">                                                     43</span>\n\f                                                                                PART E\n\nin lactational amenorrhea period; single women (such as unwed women (major),\n\ndivorced and widowed, separated women); women who are facing difficulties in\n\ncontexts of humanitarian setting/ emergencies and/or natural disasters; women\n\nvictims of domestic violence/ gender-based violence etc.” The members of the\n\nExpert Committee urged the inclusion of women in Rule 3B, who often delay\n\nrevealing the pregnancy or making decisions as to its continuance, for various\n\nreasons.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_101\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_102\">69.    The common thread running through each category of women mentioned in\n\nRule 3B is that the woman is in a unique and often difficult circumstance, with\n\nrespect to her physical, mental, social, or financial state. All the different categories\n\nin Rule 3B represent women who seek an abortion after twenty weeks either due\n\nto a delay in recognizing pregnancy, or some other change in their environment\n\nimpacting their decision on whether the pregnancy is wanted or unwanted. The law\n\nrecognizes the myriad ways in which a pregnancy may cause distress in such\n\nsituations and cause grave injury to her physical and mental health. It gives such\n\nwomen latitude in seeking out the termination of an unwelcome pregnancy by\n\nextending the gestational period up to which the termination is legally permissible.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_103\">70.    Rule 3B(a) is based on an acknowledgement of the reality that survivors of\n\nsexual assault, rape, or incest may face immense stigma if and when they share\n\nthe fact of their assault with others, including family members. It is no secret that a\n\nculture of shame surrounds sexual violence in India. Survivors are often hesitant\n\nto speak about the violence inflicted upon them. This is doubly the case with victims\n\nof incestuous sexual assault or rape, whose close relatives abuse their power and\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_97\">                                           44</span>\n\f                                                                                  PART E\n\nauthority over the woman and other family members oftentimes being unwilling to\n\nbelieve that the perpetrator (that is to say, their relative) is guilty of sexual violence.\n\nMany survivors, including minors, may not even be aware that pregnancy is a\n\npossible consequence of rape. Hence, the delay in revealing the fact that a man\n\nhas raped them may lead to a delay in discovering the pregnancy. Alternatively,\n\nthe woman in question may be unable to access medical facilities in a timely\n\nfashion and may therefore find herself unable to terminate the pregnancy before\n\nthe completion of twenty weeks.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_104\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_105\">71.    Married women may also form part of the class of survivors of sexual assault\n\nor rape. The ordinary meaning of the word ‘rape’ is sexual intercourse with a\n\nperson, without their consent or against their will, regardless of whether such\n\nforced intercourse occurs in the context of matrimony. A woman may become\n\npregnant as a result of non-consensual sexual intercourse performed upon her by\n\nher husband. We would be remiss in not recognizing that intimate partner violence\n\nis a reality and can take the form of rape. The misconception that strangers are\n\nexclusively or almost exclusively responsible for sex- and gender-based violence\n\nis a deeply regrettable one. Sex- and gender-based violence (in all its forms) within\n\nthe context of the family has long formed a part of the lived experiences of scores\n\nof women.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_106\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_107\">72.    Existing Indian laws recognize various forms of familial violence – the Pre-\n\nConception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques Act 1994 criminalises the\n\ncommunication of the sex of the foetus to the pregnant woman or her relatives.\n\n<a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_211\">Section 498A</a> of the IPC criminalises physical, mental, and emotional abuse.

An adolescent and her guardian may be wary of the\n\nmandatory reporting requirement as they may not want to entangle themselves\n\nwith the legal process.

If there is an insistence on the disclosure of the name of the\n\nminor in the report under Section 19(1) of POCSO, minors may be less likely to\n\nseek out RMPs for safe termination of their pregnancies under the <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_237\">MTP Act</a>.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_121\">81.   To ensure that the benefit of Rule 3B(b) is extended to all women under 18\n\nyears of age who engage in consensual sexual activity, it is necessary to\n\nharmoniously read both the POCSO Act and the MTP Act. For the limited purposes\n\nof providing medical termination of pregnancy in terms of the <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_238\">MTP Act</a>, we clarify\n\nthat the RMP, only on request of the minor and the guardian of the minor, need not\n\ndisclose the identity and other personal details of the minor in the information\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_103\">                                         49</span>\n\f                                                                                  PART E\n\nprovided under <a href=\"/doc/19638608/\" id=\"a_239\">Section 19(1)</a> of the POCSO Act.

A woman in such situations may have decided to have a child before the\n\nemergency or disaster which changed her material circumstances. However, this\n\nchange may understandably impact each woman’s evaluation of her ability to raise\n\na child as well as her willingness to carry the pregnancy to term. While many\n\nwomen may decide to carry the pregnancy to term, others may no longer find the\n\npregnancy to be a viable or practical option.

Rule 3B(c) states that a “change in the marital status during the ongoing\n\npregnancy (widowhood and divorce)” renders women eligible for termination of\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_108\">                                          52</span>\n\f                                                                             PART E\n\ntheir pregnancy under <a href=\"/doc/312960/\" id=\"a_247\">Section 3(2)(b)</a>. The impact of the continuance of an\n\nunwanted pregnancy on a woman’s physical or mental health should take into\n\nconsideration various social, economic, and cultural factors operating in her actual\n\nor reasonably foreseeable environment, as provided in <a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_248\">Section 3(3)</a>. The rationale\n\nbehind Rule 3B(c) is comparable to the rationale for Rule 3B(g) i.e., a change in a\n\nwoman’s material circumstances during the ongoing pregnancy.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_135\">90.   Rule 3B(c) is based on the broad recognition of the fact that a change in the\n\nmarital status of a woman often leads to a change in her material circumstances.\n\nA change in material circumstance during the ongoing pregnancy may arise when\n\na married woman divorces her husband or when he dies, as recognized by the\n\nexamples provided in parenthesis in Rule 3B(c). The fact that widowhood and\n\ndivorce are mentioned in brackets at the tail end of Rule 3B(c) does not hinder our\n\ninterpretation of the rule because they are illustrative.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_136\">91.   A change in material circumstance may also result when a woman is\n\nabandoned by her family or her partner. When a woman separates from or divorces\n\nher partner, it may be that she is in a different (and possibly less advantageous)\n\nposition financially. She may no longer have the financial resources to raise a child.\n\nThis is of special concern to women who have opted to be a homemaker thereby\n\nforgoing an income of their own. Moreover, a woman in this situation may not be\n\nprepared to raise a child as a single parent or by coparenting with her former\n\npartner. Similar consequences may follow when a woman’s partner dies.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_137\">92.   Women may undergo a sea change in their lives for reasons other than a\n\nseparation with their partner (Rule 3B(c)), detection of foetal “abnormalities” (Rule\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_109\">                                          53</span>\n\f                                                                                   PART E\n\n3B(f)), or a disaster or emergency (Rule 3B(g)). They may find themselves in the\n\nsame position (socially, mentally, financially, or even physically) as the other\n\ncategories of women enumerated in Rule 3B but for other reasons. For instance, it\n\nis not unheard of for a woman to realise that she is pregnant only after the passage\n\nof twenty weeks. 88 Other examples are if a woman loses her job and is no longer\n\nfinancially secure, or if domestic violence is perpetrated against her,89 or if she\n\nsuddenly has dependents to support. Moreover, a woman may suddenly be\n\ndiagnosed with an acute or chronic or life-threatening disease, which impacts her\n\ndecision on whether to carry the pregnancy to term. If Rule 3B(c) was to be\n\ninterpreted such that its benefits extended only to married women, it would\n\nperpetuate the stereotype and socially held notion that only married women indulge\n\nin sexual intercourse, and that consequently, the benefits in law ought to extend\n\nonly to them. This artificial distinction between married and single women is not\n\nconstitutionally sustainable. The benefits in law extend equally to both single and\n\nmarried women.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_138\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_139\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"141218881\" id=\"span_110\">93.

Zakiya Luna has, in a 2020 publication, argued that reproduction is both\n\nbiological and political. 90 According to Luna, it is biological since physical bodies\n\nreproduce, and it is political since the decision on whether to reproduce or not is\n\nnot solely a private matter. This decision is intimately linked to wider political,\n\nsocial, and economic structures. A woman’s role and status in family, and society\n\ngenerally, is often tied to childbearing and ensuring the continuation of successive\n\ngenerations.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_148\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_149\">98.     To this, we may add that a woman is often enmeshed in complex notions of\n\nfamily, community, religion, and caste. Such external societal factors affect the way\n\na woman exercises autonomy and control over her body, particularly in matters\n\nrelating to reproductive decisions. Societal factors often find reinforcement by way\n\nof legal barriers restricting a woman’s right to access abortion. The decision to have\n\nor not to have an abortion is borne out of complicated life circumstances, which\n\nonly the woman can choose on her own terms without external interference or\n\ninfluence. Reproductive autonomy requires that every pregnant woman has the\n\nintrinsic right to choose to undergo or not to undergo abortion without any consent\n\nor authorization from a third party.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_150\">\n\n\n90ZAKIYA LUNA, REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS AS HUMAN RIGHTS: WOMEN OF COLOR AND FIGHT   FOR   REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE\n(NYU Press, 2020)\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_113\">                                                56</span>\n\f                                                                                        PART F\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_151\">99.        The right to reproductive autonomy is closely linked with the right to bodily\n\nautonomy. As the term itself suggests, bodily autonomy is the right to take\n\ndecisions about one’s body. The consequences of an unwanted pregnancy on a\n\nwoman’s body as well as her mind cannot be understated. The foetus relies on the\n\npregnant woman’s body for sustenance and nourishment until it is born. The\n\nbiological process of pregnancy transforms the woman’s body to permit this. The\n\nwoman may experience swelling, body ache, contractions, morning sickness, and\n\nrestricted mobility, to name a few of a host of side effects. Further, complications\n\nmay arise which pose a risk to the life of the woman. A mere description of the side\n\neffects of a pregnancy cannot possibly do justice to the visceral image of forcing a\n\nwoman to continue with an unwanted pregnancy. Therefore, the decision to carry\n\nthe pregnancy to its full term or terminate it is firmly rooted in the right to bodily\n\nautonomy and decisional autonomy of the pregnant woman.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_152\">100. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"127517806\" id=\"span_114\">In <a href=\"/doc/127517806/\" id=\"a_254\">K S Puttaswamy v.

It was held that the state\n\nadministration cannot claim guardianship of the woman as she was a major.

This\n\nCourt concluded that the state must respect the reproductive rights of women with\n\n“mental retardation” with regard to decisions about terminating their pregnancy. In\n\nthe process, this Court recognized that a woman’s right to reproductive autonomy\n\nis a dimension of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_265\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_157\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_49\">             “22.

Privacy of the individual is an essential aspect of\n              dignity. Dignity has both an intrinsic and instrumental\n              value. As an intrinsic value, human dignity is an entitlement\n              or a constitutionally protected interest in itself. In its\n              instrumental facet, dignity and freedom are inseparably\n              intertwined, each being a facilitative tool to achieve the\n              other. The ability of the individual to protect a zone of\n              privacy enables the realisation of the full value of life and\n              liberty. Liberty has a broader meaning of which privacy is\n              a subset. All liberties may not be exercised in privacy. Yet\n              others can be fulfilled only within a private space. Privacy\n              enables the individual to retain the autonomy of the body\n              and mind. The autonomy of the individual is the ability to\n              make decisions on vital matters of concern to life. Privacy\n              has not been couched as an independent fundamental\n              right. ... The intersection between one&#x27;s mental integrity\n              and privacy entitles the individual to freedom of thought,\n              the freedom to believe in what is right, and the freedom of\n              self-determination. When these guarantees intersect with\n              gender, they create a private space which protects all\n              those elements which are crucial to gender identity. The\n              family, marriage, procreation and sexual orientation are all\n              integral to the dignity of the individual. Above all, the\n              privacy of the individual recognises an inviolable right to\n              determine how freedom shall be exercised. … Dignity\n              cannot exist without privacy. Both reside within the\n              inalienable values of life, liberty and freedom which the\n              Constitution has recognised.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_176\">114. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"168671544\" id=\"span_134\">In <a href=\"/doc/168671544/\" id=\"a_281\">Navtej Singh Johar</a> (supra), this Court read down <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_282\">Section 377</a> of the IPC\n\ninsofar as it criminalized consensual sexual conduct between adults of same sex.\n\nImportantly, this Court also recognised that the members of the LGBTQ+\n\ncommunity are entitled to a full range of constitutional rights protected under the\n\nConstitution, including the right to dignity.

In the theatre of life, without\n                   possession of the attribute of identity with dignity, the entity\n                   may be allowed entry to the centre stage but would be\n                   characterised as a spineless entity or, for that matter,\n                   projected as a ruling king without the sceptre. The purpose\n                   of saying so is that the identity of every individual attains\n                   the quality of an “individual being” only if he/she has the\n                   dignity. Dignity while expressive of choice is averse to\n                   creation of any dent. When biological expression, be\n                   it an orientation or optional expression of choice, is\n                   faced with impediment, albeit through any imposition\n                   of law, the individual&#x27;s natural and constitutional right\n                   is dented. Such a situation urges the conscience of the\n                   final constitutional arbiter to demolish the obstruction\n                   and remove the impediment so as to allow the full\n                   blossoming of the natural and constitutional rights of\n                   individuals. This is the essence of dignity and we say,\n                   without any inhibition, that it is our constitutional duty\n                   to allow the individual to behave and conduct\n                   himself/herself as he/she desires and allow him/her to\n                   express himself/herself, of course, with the consent of\n                   the other. That is the right to choose without fear. It\n                   has to be ingrained as a necessary prerequisite that\n                   consent is the real fulcrum of any sexual relationship.”\n\n                                                            (emphasis supplied)\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_178\">115. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"87705010\" id=\"span_136\">In <a href=\"/doc/87705010/\" id=\"a_283\">Independent Thought v.

The documentary material\n              placed before us clearly suggests that an early marriage\n              takes away the self-esteem and confidence of a girl child\n              and subjects her, in a sense, to sexual abuse. Under no\n              circumstances can it be said that such a girl child lives a\n              life of dignity. The right of a girl child to maintain her bodily\n              integrity is effectively destroyed by a traditional practice\n              sanctified by <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_287\">IPC</a>. Her husband, for the purposes of\n              <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_288\">Section 375</a> IPC, effectively has full control over her body\n              and can subject her to sexual intercourse without her\n              consent or without her willingness since such an activity\n              would not be rape. Anomalously, although her husband\n              can rape her but he cannot molest her for if he does so he\n              could be punished under the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_289\">IPC</a>. This was\n              recognised by LCI in its 172nd Report but was not\n              commented upon. It appears therefore that different and\n              irrational standards have been laid down for the treatment\n              of the girl child by her husband and it is necessary to\n              harmonise the provisions of various statutes and also\n              harmonise different provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_290\">IPC</a> inter se.”\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_180\">116.

True realization of reproductive autonomy is possible only by addressing\n\nproblems in the societal contexts within which individuals, particularly women, are\n\nsituated. It is not only social stigma which prevents women from realizing the right\n\nto health but also caste and economic location. The cost of an abortion at a private\n\nhospital may be prohibitive for those whose monthly salaries are a fraction of that\n\ncost. Public hospitals in rural areas are often not equipped with the resources to\n\nprovide the kind and quality of healthcare that ought to be provided free of cost or\n\nat highly subsidized rates. A lack of awareness about the resources that public\n\nhospitals offer coupled with the discriminatory attitudes of many health providers\n\nonly serve to exacerbate this problem.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_200\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_201\">130. <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_321\">The MTP Act</a> recognises the reproductive autonomy of every pregnant\n\nwoman to choose medical intervention to terminate her pregnancy.

It is meaningless\n\nto speak of the latter in the absence of the former.
