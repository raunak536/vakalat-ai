With regards to the applicability of <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the RTI Act, 2005\nregarding non-disclosure of the Income Tax Returns, this Commission refers to\nthe judgment dated 03-10-2012 of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court of India in\nSLP(C) No. 27734 of 2012 titled as <a href=\"/doc/160205361/\" id=\"a_7\">Girish Ramchandra Deshpande v.\nCentral Information Commission</a> &amp; ors., wherein, it has been held as under:-</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">          &quot;12. The petitioner herein sought for copies of all memos, show\n          cause notices and censure/punishment awarded to the third\n          respondent from his employer and also details viz. movable and\n          immovable properties and also the details of his investments,\n          lending and borrowing from Banks and other financial\n          institutions. Further, he has also sought for the details of gifts\n          stated to have accepted by the third respondent, his family\n          members and friends and relatives at the marriage of his son.\n          The information mostly sought for finds a place in the income\n          tax returns of the third respondent. The question that has come\n          up for consideration is whether the abovementioned\n          information sought for qualifies to be &quot;personal information&quot; as\n          defined in clause (j) of <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 8(1)</a> of the RTI Act.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">          13. We are in agreement with the CIC and the courts below that\n          the details called for by the petitioner i.e. copies of all memos\n          issued to the third respondent, show cause notices and orders of\n          censure/punishment etc. are qualified to be personal\n          information as defined in clause (j) of <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 8(1)</a> of the RTI\n          Act. The performance of an employee/officer in an organization\n          is primarily a matter between the employee and the employer\n          and normally those aspects are governed by the service rules\n          which fall under the expression &quot;personal information&quot;, the\n          disclosure of which has no relationship to any public activity or\n          public interest. On the other hand, the disclosure of which\n          would cause unwarranted invasion of privacy of that individual.\n          Of course, in a given case, if the Central Public Information\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                                                       Page 2 of 6</span>\n           Officer or the State Public Information Officer of the Appellate\n          Authority is satisfied that the larger public interest justifies the\n          disclosure of such information, appropriate orders could be\n          passed but the petitioner cannot claim those details as a matter\n          of right.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">          14. The details disclosed by a person in his income tax returns\n          are &quot;personal information&quot; which stand exempted from\n          disclosure under clause (j) of <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 8(1)</a> of the RTI Act,\n          unless involves a larger public interest and the Central Public\n          Information Officer or the State Public Information Officer or\n          the Appellate Authority is satisfied that the larger public\n          interest justifies the disclosure of such information.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_8\">7.     Henceforth, the legal issue to be decided herein is whether the appellant\nclaiming to be the legally wedded wife of Mr. Devendra V Kakodkar is entitled\nto seek details of his income tax returns. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"45224879\" id=\"span_4\">In this regard, it is apt to mention the\ndecision dated 01-07-2009 of the Hon&#x27;ble High Court of Delhi in W.P.(C)\n803/2009 titled as <a href=\"/doc/45224879/\" id=\"a_11\">Vijay Prakash v.

Since filing of the Income Tax Returns by an individual with the Income\nTax Department is not a public activity and rather it is in the nature of\nan obligation which a citizen owes to the State viz. to pay his taxes, this\ninformation cannot be disclosed to the appellant in the absence of any larger\npublic interest relying on the legal principle enunciated in the judgment dated\n11-06-2015 rendered by the Hon&#x27;ble Bombay High Court in Writ Petition No.\n8753 of 2013 titled as <a href=\"/doc/47087959/\" id=\"a_13\">Shailesh Gandhi v.

I am afraid the said contention is\n          thoroughly misconceived as filing of Income Tax Returns can\n          be no stretch of imagination be said to be a public activity, but\n          is an obligation which a citizen owes to the State viz. to pay his\n          taxes and since the said information is held by the Income Tax\n          Department in a fiduciary capacity, the same cannot be directed\n          to be revealed unless the pre-requisites for the same are\n          satisfied.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                                                         Page 3 of 6</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\"> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"69052901\" id=\"span_7\">9.

Indisputably, <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the Act would be applicable\n     to the information pertaining to Dr Naresh Trehan (petitioner in\n     W.P.(C) 88/2010) and the information contained in the income tax\n     returns would be personal information under <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the\n     Act. However, the CIC directed disclosure of information of Dr\n     Trehan also by concluding that income tax returns and\n     information provided for assessment was in relation to a &quot;public\n     activity.&quot; In my view, this is wholly erroneous and unmerited. The\n     act of filing returns with the department cannot be construed as\n     public activity. The expression &quot;public activity&quot; would mean\n     activities of a public nature and not necessarily act done in\n     compliance of a statute. The expression &quot;public activity&quot; would\n     denote activity done for the public and/or in some manner\n     available for participation by public or some section of public.\n     There is no public activity involved in filing a return or an\n     individual pursuing his assessment with the income tax\n     authorities. In this view, the information relating to individual\n     assessee could not be disclosed. Unless, the CIC held that the\n     same was justified &quot;in the larger public interest.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"144795012\" id=\"span_8\">10.

At this juncture, this Commission deems it appropriate to quote <a href=\"/doc/436180/\" id=\"a_26\">Section\n2(n)</a> of the RTI Act, 2005 which reads as under:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">     &quot;2(n):- &quot;third party&quot; means a person other than the citizen making a\n     request for information and includes a public authority.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">12. From the words circumscribed u/<a href=\"/doc/436180/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 2(n)</a> of the RTI Act, 2005, it is\nvividly clear that any person other than the citizen making a request for\ninformation can be termed as &#x27;third party&#x27;. Therefore, Mr. Devendra V\nKakodkar being a person other than the RTI applicant surely comes within the\ndefinition of &#x27;third party&#x27;. Moreover, the CPIO has also not intended to disclose\nthe information treating it as confidential and has rather pleaded that there is no\npublic interest in the matter. This Commission also does not find any public\ninterest which outweighs the harm caused in its disclosure.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"155236387\" id=\"span_14\">13.

Similarly, professional records, including\n         qualification, performance, evaluation reports, ACRs,\n         disciplinary proceedings, etc. are all personal information.\n         Medical records, treatment, choice of medicine, list of hospitals\n         and doctors visited, findings recorded, including that of the\n         family members, information relating to assets, liabilities,\n         income tax returns, details of investments, lending and\n         borrowing, etc. are personal information.
