After hearing the learned counsel for the  respondent-writ  petitioner\nand the learned Additional Solicitor General for Union of India, this  Court\nheld in the judgment under review that the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/280060/\" id=\"a_16\">Sections 12(5)</a>  and\n<a href=\"/doc/1272769/\" id=\"a_17\">15(5)</a> of the Act did not specify the basic qualifications of the persons  to\nbe appointed as Information Commissioners and only mentioned that the  Chief\nInformation Commissioner and Information Commissioners shall be  persons  of\neminence in public life with wide knowledge and experience in  law,  science\nand technology,  social  service,  management,  journalism,  mass  media  or\nadministration and governance.  This  Court  held  that  the  knowledge  and\nexperience in the different fields mentioned in <a href=\"/doc/280060/\" id=\"a_18\">Section  12(5)</a>  and  <a href=\"/doc/1272769/\" id=\"a_19\">Section\n15(5)</a>  of  the  Act  would  presuppose  a  graduate  who   possesses   basic\nqualification in the concerned field.  This Court also  held  that  <a href=\"/doc/1089993/\" id=\"a_20\">Sections\n12(6)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/962470/\" id=\"a_21\">15(6)</a> of  the  Act,  which  provide  that  the  Chief  Information\nCommissioner or an  Information  Commissioner  shall  not  be  a  Member  of\nParliament or Member of the Legislature of any State or Union  Territory  or\nhold any other office of profit or be connected with any political party  or\ncarry on any business or pursue  any  profession,  do  not  disqualify  such\npersons for consideration for appointment as Chief Information  Commissioner\nor Information Commissioner, but  these  disqualifications  will  come  into\nplay  after  a  person  is  appointed  as  Chief  Election  Commissioner  or\nInformation  Commissioner.   In  other  words,  after   a   Chief   Election\nCommissioner or Information Commissioner is appointed,  he  cannot  continue\nto be a Member of Parliament or Member of the Legislature of  any  State  or\nhold any other office of profit  or  remain  connected  with  any  political\nparty or carry on any business or pursue any profession.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">4.     In  the  judgment  under  review,  this  Court  also  held  that  the\nInformation Commission, as a body, performs  functions  of  wide  magnitude,\nthrough its members, including adjudicatory, supervisory as  well  as  penal\nfunctions.  This Court held  that  access  to  information  is  a  statutory\nright, subject to certain constitutional and statutory limitations  and  the\nInformation Commissioners  have  been  vested  with  the  power  to  decline\nfurnishing of information under certain circumstances and in  the  specified\nsituations.  This Court held that disclosure of information  under  the  Act\nmay also involve the question of prejudice to a third party, unlike in  some\ncountries where information involving a  third  party  cannot  be  disclosed\nwithout the consent of that party.  This Court  held  that  considering  all\nthese functions to be performed by the Information Commission, the  exercise\nof powers and passing of the orders by the Information Commission cannot  be\narbitrary and have to be  in  consonance  with  the  principles  of  natural\njustice, namely, notice  to  a  party,  grant  of  hearing  and  passing  of\nreasoned orders, and, therefore, the Information Commission  is  a  Tribunal\ndischarging quasi-judicial functions.  This Court held that there is  a  lis\nto be decided by the Information Commission inasmuch as  the  request  of  a\nparty seeking information is to be allowed  or  to  be  disallowed  and  the\ndecisions  rendered  by  the  Information  Commission  on  such  a  lis  may\nprejudicially affect a third party.  For these reasons, this  Court  further\nheld that the Information Commission possesses the essential attributes  and\ntrappings  of  a  Court  as  the  adjudicatory  powers  performed   by   the\nInformation Commission are akin to the Court  system  and  the  adjudicatory\nmatters that they decide can have serious  consequences  on  various  rights\nincluding  the  right  to  privacy  protected  under  <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_22\">Article  21</a>   of   the\nConstitution.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"653417\" id=\"span_1\">5.    In the judgment under review, this Court also  expressed  the  opinion\nthat for effectively performing the functions and exercising the  powers  of\nthe Information Commission, there is a requirement of a judicial mind.   For\nholding this opinion, the Court relied on the judgments  of  this  Court  in\n<a href=\"/doc/653417/\" id=\"a_23\">Bharat Bank Ltd., Delhi v. Employees of Bharat Bank  &amp;  Ors.</a>  [AIR  1950  SC\n188], S.P. Sampath Kumar v. Union of India and Others [(1987)  1  SCC  124],\nUnion of India v. R. Gandhi, President Madras  Bar  Association  [(2010)  11\nSCC 1] and L. Chandra Kumar v. Union of  India  and  Others  [(1997)  3  SCC\n261].</span>  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"118255233\" id=\"span_2\">This Court also held that separation of powers and  the  independence\nof judiciary are fundamental constitutional values in the structure  of  our\nConstitution  as  without  these  two  constitutional  values,  impartiality\ncannot thrive as has been held by  this  Court  in  <a href=\"/doc/118255233/\" id=\"a_24\">Union  of  India  v.  R.\nGandhi, President, Madras Bar Association</a> (supra).  This Court,  thus,  held\nthat though the independence of  judiciary  stricto  sensu  applied  to  the\nCourt system, by necessary implication, it would  also  apply  to  Tribunals\nwhose functioning is quasi-judicial and akin to the  Court  system  and  the\nentire administration of justice has to be so  independent  and  managed  by\npersons of legal acumen, expertise and  experience  that  persons  demanding\njustice must not only receive justice, but should also have the  faith  that\njustice would be  done.   This  Court  accordingly  held  that  the  persons\neligible for appointment should be of public eminence,  with  knowledge  and\nexperience in the specified fields and should preferably have some  judicial\nbackground and they should possess judicial acumen and experience to  fairly\nand effectively deal with the intricate questions of law that would come  up\nfor determination  before  the  Information  Commission  in  its  day-to-day\nworking.  This Court held that the  Information  Commission  is  a  judicial\ntribunal having the essential trappings of a Court and, as  an  irresistible\ncorollary,  it  will  follow  that  the  appointments  to  the   Information\nCommission  are  made  in  consultation  with  the  judiciary.   The  Court,\nhowever, observed that in the event, the Government is of  the  opinion  and\ndesires to appoint not only judicial members but  also  experts  from  other\nfields to the Commission in terms of <a href=\"/doc/280060/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 12(5)</a> of  the  Act,  to  ensure\njudicial independence, effective adjudicatory process and public  confidence\nin the administration of justice by the Commission, it  would  be  necessary\nthat the Commission is required to work in Benches comprising  one  judicial\nmember and one other member from the specified fields mentioned in  <a href=\"/doc/280060/\" id=\"a_26\">Sections\n12(5)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1272769/\" id=\"a_27\">15(5)</a> of the Act.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"118255233\" id=\"span_3\">6.    On the appointment procedure, this Court also  held  in  the  judgment\nunder review that the appointments to the post of judicial member has to  be\nmade in consultation with the Chief  Justice  of  India  in  case  of  Chief\nInformation Commissioner and members of the Central Information  Commission,\nand the Chief Justices of the High Courts of the respective States,  in  the\ncase  of  State  Chief  Information  Commissioner  and   State   Information\nCommissioners of that State Commission.  This <a href=\"/doc/118255233/\" id=\"a_28\">Court  further  held</a>  that  in\nthe case of appointment of members to the respective Commissions from  other\nspecified fields, the DoPT in the Centre and the concerned Ministry  in  the\nStates should prepare a panel, after due publicity.  Empanelling  the  names\nproposed should be at least three times the number of vacancies existing  in\nthe Commission and the names so empanelled, with the relevant record  should\nbe placed before the High Powered Committee mentioned in <a href=\"/doc/372537/\" id=\"a_29\">Section  12(3)</a>  and\n<a href=\"/doc/1358055/\" id=\"a_30\">15(3)</a> of the Act and in furtherance  of  the  recommendations  of  the  High\nPowered  Committee,  appointments  to  the  Central  and  State  Information\nCommissions should be made by the competent authority.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">7.    For the reasons recorded in the  judgment  under  review,  this  Court\ndisposed of the writ petition of the  respondent-writ  petitioner  with  the\nfollowing directions/declarations:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">        “1. The writ petition is partly allowed.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_4\">        2. The provisions of <a href=\"/doc/280060/\" id=\"a_31\">Sections 12(5)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1272769/\" id=\"a_32\">15(5)</a> of the  Act  of  2005\n        are held to be constitutionally valid, but with the rider that,  to\n        give it a meaningful and purposive interpretation, it is  necessary\n        for the Court to &#x27;read into&#x27; these provisions some aspects  without\n        which  these  provisions  are  bound  to  offend  the  doctrine  of\n        equality. Thus, we hold and declare that the expression  &#x27;knowledge\n        and experience&#x27;  appearing  in  these  provisions  would  mean  and\n        include a basic degree in the respective field and  the  experience\n        gained thereafter. Further, without any peradventure and veritably,\n        we state that appointments of legally qualified, judicially trained\n        and experienced persons would certainly manifest in more  effective\n        serving  of  the  ends  of  justice  as  well  as  ensuring  better\n        administration of justice by the Commission. It  would  render  the\n        adjudicatory process which involves critical  legal  questions  and\n        nuances of law, more adherent to  justice  and  shall  enhance  the\n        public confidence in the working of the  Commission.  This  is  the\n        obvious interpretation of the language of these provisions and,  in\n        fact, is the essence thereof.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_5\">        3. As opposed to declaring the  provisions  of  <a href=\"/doc/1089993/\" id=\"a_33\">Section  12(6)</a>  and\n        <a href=\"/doc/962470/\" id=\"a_34\">15(6)</a> unconstitutional, we would prefer to read these provisions as\n        having    effect    &#x27;post-appointment&#x27;.     In     other     words,\n        cessation/termination of holding of office of profit, pursuing  any\n        profession or carrying any business is a condition precedent to the\n        appointment of  a  person  as  Chief  Information  Commissioner  or\n        Information Commissioner at the Centre or State levels.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_6\">        4. There is an absolute necessity for the legislature to reword  or\n        amend the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/280060/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 12(5)</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1089993/\" id=\"a_36\">12(6)</a> and  <a href=\"/doc/1272769/\" id=\"a_37\">15(5)</a>,  <a href=\"/doc/962470/\" id=\"a_38\">15(6)</a>  of\n        the Act. We observe and hope that these provisions would be amended\n        at the earliest by  the  legislature  to  avoid  any  ambiguity  or\n        impracticability  and  to  make   it   in   consonance   with   the\n        constitutional mandates.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_7\">        5. We also direct that the Central Government and/or the  competent\n        authority shall frame all practice and procedure related  rules  to\n        make working  of  the  Information  Commissions  effective  and  in\n        consonance with the basic rule of law. Such rules should be  framed\n        with particular reference to <a href=\"/doc/773502/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 27</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1606088/\" id=\"a_40\">28</a> of the Act within  a\n        period of six months from today.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_8\">        6. We are of the considered  view  that  it  is  an  unquestionable\n        proposition of law that the Commission  is  a  &#x27;judicial  tribunal&#x27;\n        performing functions of  &#x27;judicial&#x27;  as  well  as  &#x27;quasi-judicial&#x27;\n        nature and having the trappings of a Court. It is an important  cog\n        and is part of the  court  attached  system  of  administration  of\n        justice, unlike a ministerial tribunal which is more influenced and\n        controlled  and  performs  functions  akin  to  the  machinery   of\n        administration.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_9\">        7. It will be just,  fair  and  proper  that  the  first  appellate\n        authority (i.e. the senior officers to be  nominated  in  terms  of\n        <a href=\"/doc/698257/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 5</a> of the Act of 2005)  preferably  should  be  the  persons\n        possessing a  degree  in  law  or  having  adequate  knowledge  and\n        experience in the field of law.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_10\">        8. The Information  Commissions  at  the  respective  levels  shall\n        henceforth work in Benches of two members each. One of them being a\n        &#x27;judicial member&#x27;, while the other an &#x27;expert member&#x27;. The judicial\n        member should be a person possessing a  degree  in  law,  having  a\n        judicially trained  mind  and  experience  in  performing  judicial\n        functions. A law officer or a lawyer may also be eligible  provided\n        he is a person who has practiced law  at  least  for  a  period  of\n        twenty years as on the  date  of  the  advertisement.  Such  lawyer\n        should  also  have  experience  in  social  work.  We  are  of  the\n        considered view that the competent authority should prefer a person\n        who is or has been a Judge of the High  Court  for  appointment  as\n        Information Commissioners. The Chief  Information  Commissioner  at\n        the Centre or State level shall only be a person who is or has been\n        a Chief Justice of the High Court or a Judge of the  Supreme  Court\n        of India.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_11\">        9. The appointment of the judicial members to any  of  these  posts\n        shall be made &#x27;in consultation&#x27; with the Chief Justice of India and\n        Chief Justices of the High Courts of the respective States, as  the\n        case may be.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_12\">        10. The appointment of the Information Commissioners at both levels\n        should be made from amongst the persons empanelled by the  DoPT  in\n        the case of Centre and the concerned Ministry  in  the  case  of  a\n        State. The panel has to be prepared upon due advertisement and on a\n        rational basis as afore-recorded.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_13\">        11. The panel so prepared by the DoPT  or  the  concerned  Ministry\n        ought to be placed before the High-powered Committee  in  terms  of\n        <a href=\"/doc/372537/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 12(3)</a>, for final recommendation to the President of  India.\n        Needless to repeat that the High Powered Committee  at  the  Centre\n        and the State levels is expected to adopt a  fair  and  transparent\n        method of recommending the names for appointment to  the  competent\n        authority.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_14\">        12. The selection process should be commenced at least three months\n        prior to the occurrence of vacancy.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\">        13. This judgment shall have effect only prospectively.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\">        14. Under the scheme of the Act of  2005,  it  is  clear  that  the\n        orders of the Commissions are subject to judicial review before the\n        High Court and then before the Supreme Court of India. In terms  of\n        <a href=\"/doc/882644/\" id=\"a_43\">Article 141</a> of the Constitution, the judgments of the Supreme Court\n        are law of the land and are binding on all  courts  and  tribunals.\n        Thus, it is abundantly clear that  the  Information  Commission  is\n        bound by the law of precedent, i.e., judgments of  the  High  Court\n        and the Supreme Court of  India.  In  order  to  maintain  judicial\n        discipline and consistency in the functioning of the Commission, we\n        direct that the Commission shall give appropriate attention to  the\n        doctrine of precedent and shall not overlook the judgments  of  the\n        courts dealing with the subject and  principles  applicable,  in  a\n        given case.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_17\">        It is not only  the  higher  court&#x27;s  judgments  that  are  binding\n        precedents for the Information Commission, but even  those  of  the\n        larger Benches of the Commission should be given due acceptance and\n        enforcement by the smaller Benches of the Commission. The  rule  of\n        precedence  is  equally  applicable  to  intra-court   appeals   or\n        references in the hierarchy of the Commission.”\n\nContentions of the learned counsel for the parties:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">8.    Mr. A.S. Chandhiok, learned ASG appearing  for  the  Union  of  India,\nsubmitted that under the Constitution it is only the Legislature  which  has\nthe power to make law and amend the law and the Court cannot in exercise  of\nits judicial power encroach into the field of legislation.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1930205\" id=\"span_4\">In  support  of\nthis submission, he relied on the decision of a seven-Judge  Bench  of  this\nCourt in <a href=\"/doc/1930205/\" id=\"a_44\">P. Ramachandra Rao v. State of Karnataka</a>  [(2002)  4  SCC  578]  in\nwhich  this  Court  has  recognised  the  limits  of  judicial  power  in  a\nconstitutional democracy.</span>  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"92507\" id=\"span_5\">He also cited the  decision  of  a  three-  Judge\nBench in <a href=\"/doc/92507/\" id=\"a_45\">Union of India and Another v. Deoki  Nandan  Aggarwal</a>  [1992  Supp.</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">(1) SCC 323] for the proposition  that  courts  cannot  rewrite,  recast  or\nreframe the legislation for the very good reason that it  has  no  power  to\nlegislate.  He submitted that this being the position  of  law,  this  Court\ncould not have held in the judgment under  review  that  the  knowledge  and\nexperience in different fields mentioned in <a href=\"/doc/280060/\" id=\"a_46\">Sections 12(5)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1272769/\" id=\"a_47\">15(5)</a> of  the\nAct would presuppose a graduate or basic degree in the concerned field  when\nParliament has not provided in <a href=\"/doc/280060/\" id=\"a_48\">Sections 12(5)</a> and  <a href=\"/doc/1272769/\" id=\"a_49\">15(5)</a>  of  the  Act  that\nonly persons with basic  degree  in  law,  science  and  technology,  social\nscience, management, journalism, mass media,  etc.  would  be  eligible  for\nappointment   as   Chief   Information    Commissioner    and    Information\nCommissioners.  He submitted that directions nos. 2 and 7  of  the  judgment\nunder review that persons possessing basic degree in the  respective  fields\ncan be Information Commissioners amount to amendment of <a href=\"/doc/280060/\" id=\"a_50\">Sections  12(5)</a>  and\n<a href=\"/doc/1272769/\" id=\"a_51\">15(5)</a> of the Act.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_18\">9.    Mr. Chandhiok next submitted that the view taken by this Court in  the\njudgment under review that the Information Commissioners should possess  the\nessential attributes of a court and  that  for  effectively  performing  the\nfunctions and powers of the Information Commission there is  requirement  of\na judicial mind and hence persons eligible for  appointment  as  Information\nCommissioners should preferably have some judicial  background  and  possess\njudicial acumen, is a patent error of law.  He  submitted  that  Information\nCommissioners have a duty  to  act  judicially  and  perform  quasi-judicial\nfunctions, but this does not mean that they must  have  the  experience  and\nacumen of judicial officers.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1531171\" id=\"span_6\">In support of this submission,  he  cited  the\nobservations of Hidayatullah, J in  <a href=\"/doc/1531171/\" id=\"a_52\">Harinagar  Sugar  Mills  Ltd.  v.  Shyam\nSunder Jhunjhunwala and Others</a> (AIR 1961 SC 1669) that  an  officer  who  is\nrequired to decide the matters judicially does not make him a Court or  even\na Tribunal because that only establishes that he is following the  standards\nof conduct and is free  from  bias  and  interest.   He  submitted  that  as\nInformation Commissions are not really exercising judicial powers,  and  are\nnot courts, Parliament has not provided in <a href=\"/doc/280060/\" id=\"a_53\">Sections 12(5)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1272769/\" id=\"a_54\">15(5)</a>  of  the\nAct that Information Commissioners have  to  have  judicial  experience  and\nacumen.  He argued that direction no. 8 that Information Commissions at  the\nrespective levels shall work in Benches of two members each and one of  them\nhas to  be  a  judicial  member  possessing  a  degree  in  law  and  having\njudicially trained mind and experience in performing judicial functions  and\nthe direction that competent authority should prefer a person who is or  has\nbeen a Judge of the High Court for appointment as Information  Commissioners\nand that the Chief Information Commissioner shall only be a  person  who  is\nor has been a Chief Justice of a High Court or a Judge of the Supreme  Court\nof India is a palpable error which needs to be  corrected  in  this  review.\nHe further submitted that consequently direction no.9 in the judgment  under\nreview  that  the   appointment   of   judicial   members   as   Information\nCommissioners shall be in consultation with the Chief Justice of  India  and\nChief Justice of High Court of the respective States, as the  case  may  be,\nshould be deleted.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"758713\" id=\"span_7\">10.   Mr.  Chandhiok  finally  submitted  that  in  direction  no.5  of  the\njudgment  under  review,  this  Court  has  further  directed  the   Central\nGovernment to frame  all  practice  and  procedure  related  rules  to  make\nworking of the Information Commissions effective and in consonance with  the\nbasic rule of law under <a href=\"/doc/773502/\" id=\"a_55\">Sections 27</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1606088/\" id=\"a_56\">28</a> of the Act within a period  of  6\nmonths but law is well settled that the Court cannot direct  a  rule  making\nauthority to make rules in a particular fashion.  He relied on the  decision\nof this Court in <a href=\"/doc/758713/\" id=\"a_57\">Mallikarjuna Rao and Others v. State of Andhra Pradesh  and\nOthers</a> [(1990) 2 SCC 707] in support of this  submission.   He  argued  that\ndirection no.5 of the judgment under review is, therefore,  a  patent  error\nwhich needs to be corrected in this review.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"522930\" id=\"span_8\">11.   Dr. Manish Singhvi, Additional  Advocate  General  for  the  State  of\nRajasthan, submitted that  the  Information  Commissioners  do  not  perform\nfunctions which prior to the Act were vested in courts  and  therefore  they\nneed not be persons having  judicial  background/judicial  training/judicial\nexperience.  He submitted that in <a href=\"/doc/522930/\" id=\"a_58\">Union of India v. R.  Gandhi,  Madras  Bar\nAssociation</a> (supra), this Court took the view that only if  functions  which\nhave been dealt with by civil courts  are  transferred  to  tribunals,  such\ntribunals should be manned by persons  having  judicial  background/judicial\ntraining/judicial experience.  He submitted that  the  view  taken  by  this\nCourt  in  the  judgment  under  review   that   persons   having   judicial\nbackground/judicial training/judicial experience should be  preferred  while\nappointing Information Commissioners is an apparent error  which  should  be\ncorrected in this review.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_21\">12.   Mr. M.S. Ganesh, learned senior counsel appearing for the  intervener,\nCommonwealth  Human  Rights  Initiative,  submitted  that  the   Information\nCommission is not vested with sovereign judicial powers and discharges  only\nadministrative functions under the provisions of the Act and the view  taken\nby this Court in the judgment under review  that  Information  Commissioners\nshould be  persons  having  judicial  background,  judicial  experience  and\njudicial acumen is not a  correct  view.   He  cited  the  opinion  of  Lord\nGreene, M.R. in B. Johnson &amp; Co. (Builders),  Ltd.  v.  Minister  of  Health\n[(1947) 2 All England Law Reports 395]  as  well  as  the  opinion  of  Lord\nDiplock in Bushell v. Secretary of State for the Environment [(1980)  2  All\nER  608  HL]  that  Information  Commissioners  arrive   at   administrative\ndecisions and do not decide litigations and therefore  they  need  not  have\njudicial background, judicial experience and judicial  acumen.   Mr.  Ganesh\nnext submitted that persons who have been  appointed  as  Chief  Information\nCommissioners and Information Commissioners under <a href=\"/doc/280060/\" id=\"a_59\">Sections 12(5)</a>  and  <a href=\"/doc/1272769/\" id=\"a_60\">15(5)</a>\nof the Act, have been persons without  any  eminence  in  public  life.   He\nsubmitted that mostly retired IAS Officers  and  IPS  Officers  without  any\nexperience in public life but only experience in  administration  have  been\nappointed as Information Commissioners.  He submitted that in  this  review,\nthe Court should issue appropriate directions to ensure that appointment  of\nChief information Commissioners and Information Commissioners  are  made  in\naccordance with <a href=\"/doc/280060/\" id=\"a_61\">Sections 12(5)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1272769/\" id=\"a_62\">15(5)</a> of the Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_22\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"310431\" id=\"span_9\">13.   Mr.  Prashant  Bhushan,  learned  senior  counsel  appearing  for  the\ninterveners, Mr. Shailesh Gandhi and Mrs. Aruna Roy, submitted that  as  the\nInformation Commissions do not perform  judicial  work,  they  need  not  be\nmanned by judicial officers and Justices of High Courts  and  Supreme  Court\nand, therefore, directions No.8 and 9 of the judgment under review  need  to\nbe deleted.  He further submitted  that  directions  No.10  and  11  of  the\njudgment  under  review  regarding  the  procedure  to   be   followed   for\nappointment of Information Commissioners may not ensure transparency in  the\nmatter of appointment of Information Commissioners.  He submitted that  this\nCourt in Centre for <a href=\"/doc/310431/\" id=\"a_63\">PIL and Another v. Union of India &amp;  Another</a>  [(2011)  4\nSCC] has laid down a procedure in para 88 for selecting and  appointing  the\nCentral Vigilance Commissioner and Vigilance Commissioners under  <a href=\"/doc/199115340/\" id=\"a_64\">Section  3\n(3)</a> of the Central Vigilance Commission Act, 2003 and has laid down  therein\nthat the empanelment of persons to be considered for appointment of  Central\nVigilance Commissioner and Vigilance Commissioner shall be  carried  out  on\nthe basis of rational criteria, which is to be  reflected  by  recording  of\nreasons and/or  noting akin to reasons by  the  empanelling  authority.   He\nsubmitted that similar  procedure  should  be  followed  for  short  listing\npersons for  appointment  as  Information  Commissioners  and  some  reasons\nshould  be  indicated  as  to  why  the  person  has  been  empanelled   for\nappointment as Information Commissioner.   He  further  submitted  that  the\ndirection No.8 in the judgment under review that  Information  Commissioners\nat the respective levels shall henceforth work in  benches  of  two  members\nand one of them should be  a  judicial  member  would  result  in  very  few\nDivision Benches of the Information Commission taking  up  matters  and  the\nworking of the Information Commission in  dealing  with  matters  will  slow\ndown.  He submitted that instead legal training can be given to  Information\nCommissioners to decide matters involving intricate questions of law.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_23\">14.   Learned counsel for the respondent- writ petitioner Mr.  Amit  Sharma,\non the other hand, supported the judgment under review.  According  to  him,\nthis Court has rightly held that the Information Commission functions as  an\nadjudicatory authority and decides issues relating to the fundamental  right\nof a citizen to be informed about the Government policies  and  information.\nHe submitted that to ensure proper adjudication of the fundamental right  to\ninformation  of  every  citizen,  it  is  absolutely   necessary   that   an\nindependent person who does not have a  political  agenda  is  appointed  as\nInformation   Commissioner.    He   further   submitted   that   Information\nCommissioners also have to adjudicate issues relating to  right  of  privacy\nof the citizens of India, which is part  of  their  personal  liberty  under\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_65\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution and  for  this  reason  also  a  person  with\njudicial experience and training is best suited  and  therefore  this  Court\nhas rightly held that persons with  judicial  experience  and  training  and\njudicial  acumen  should  be  preferred  for  appointment   as   Information\nCommissioners.  He finally submitted that it will be evident  from  <a href=\"/doc/1831074/\" id=\"a_66\">Sections\n7</a>, <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_67\">8</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1053993/\" id=\"a_68\">9</a> and <a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_69\">11</a> of the Act that a lis between the parties  will  have  to  be\ndecided  by  the  Central  Public  Information  Officer  or   State   Public\nInformation Officer and this  Court  has  rightly  held  in  judgment  under\nreview that Information Commissions which decide appeals  under  <a href=\"/doc/1369783/\" id=\"a_70\">Section  20</a>\nof the Act against the decisions of the Central Public  Information  Officer\nor State Public Information Officer are akin  to  courts.   He  referred  to\n<a href=\"/doc/1083556/\" id=\"a_71\">Section 18</a> of the Act to show that Information Commissions have been  vested\nwith the powers of a civil court  and,  therefore,  are  in  the  nature  of\ncourts which have to be manned by judicial officers.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1525571\" id=\"span_10\">15.   Mr. Sharma vehemently argued that in the event  this  Court  holds  in\nthis review that the persons with judicial experience and training need  not\nbe appointed as Information Commissioners, then the  provisions  of  <a href=\"/doc/280060/\" id=\"a_72\">Section\n12(5)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1272769/\" id=\"a_73\">15(5)</a> of the Act have to be struck down as ultra vires <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_74\">Article  14</a>\nof the Constitution.  He cited the decision of this Court in  <a href=\"/doc/1525571/\" id=\"a_75\">Indra  Das  v.\nState of Assam</a> [(2011) 3 SCC 380] in which it has been held that  ordinarily\nthe literal rule of interpretation while construing  a  statutory  provision\nshould be followed,  but  where  such  interpretation  makes  the  provision\nunconstitutional it can be departed from and  the  statute  should  be  read\ndown to make it constitutional.  He submitted that  in  the  judgment  under\nreview, this Court has saved the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/280060/\" id=\"a_76\">Section 12(5)</a>  and  <a href=\"/doc/1272769/\" id=\"a_77\">15(5)</a>  of\nthe Act by reading down the said provisions.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"118255233\" id=\"span_11\">16.   Mr. Sharma referred to the chart at page 40 of the  writ  petition  to\nshow  qualifications  of  persons  appointed   equivalent   to   Information\nCommissioners in Australia, Canada, Scotland, England and United States  and\nargued that they are required to obtain a degree in the field  of  law.   He\ncited the observations of this Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/118255233/\" id=\"a_78\">Union  of  India  v.  R.\nGandhi, President, Madras Bar Association</a> (supra) that the  assumption  that\nmembers  of  the  civil  services  will  have  the  judicial  experience  or\nexpertise in company law to  be  appointed  either  as  judicial  member  or\ntechnical member is an erroneous assumption.   He  submitted  that  <a href=\"/doc/118255233/\" id=\"a_79\">in  that\ncase</a>, this Court therefore issued directions that only High Court Judges  or\nDistrict Judges of 5 years experience  or  lawyers  having  practice  of  10\nyears can be considered for appointment as judicial members of the  National\nCompany Law Tribunal.</span>  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"132042\" id=\"span_12\">He also relied on  the  decision  of  this  Court  in\n<a href=\"/doc/132042/\" id=\"a_80\">Pareena Swarup v.

A  three\nJudge Bench of this Court has held in <a href=\"/doc/65836047/\" id=\"a_83\">Commissioner of Sales Tax, J &amp;  K  and\nOthers v. Pine Chemicals Ltd. and  Others</a>  [(1995)  1  SCC  58]  that  if  a\nreasoning in the judgment under review is at variance  with  the  clear  and\nsimple language in a statute, the  judgment  under  review  suffers  from  a\nmanifest error of law, an error apparent on the face of the record,  and  is\nliable to be rectified.  Hence,  in  these  Review  Petitions,  we  have  to\ndecide whether the reasoning and directions in the judgment under review  is\nat variance with the clear and simple language  employed  in  the  different\nprovisions of the Act and accordingly  whether  the  judgment  under  review\nsuffers from manifest errors of law apparent on the face of the record.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\">18.

It will be clear from the plain and simple language  of  <a href=\"/doc/1083556/\" id=\"a_95\">Sections  18</a>,\n<a href=\"/doc/593162/\" id=\"a_96\">19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1369783/\" id=\"a_97\">20</a> of the Act that, under <a href=\"/doc/1083556/\" id=\"a_98\">Section 18</a> the Information  Commission  has\nthe power and function to receive and inquire  into  a  complaint  from  any\nperson who is not able to secure information from a public authority,  under\n<a href=\"/doc/593162/\" id=\"a_99\">Section 19</a> it decides appeals against the decisions of  the  Central  Public\nInformation Officer or the State  Public  Information  Officer  relating  to\ninformation sought by a person,  and  under  <a href=\"/doc/1369783/\" id=\"a_100\">Section  20</a>  it  can  impose  a\npenalty only for the purpose of ensuring that  the  correct  information  is\nfurnished to a person seeking information from a public  authority.   Hence,\nthe functions of the Information Commissions are limited to ensuring that  a\nperson who has sought information from  a  public  authority  in  accordance\nwith his right to information conferred under <a href=\"/doc/1979161/\" id=\"a_101\">Section 3</a> of the  Act  is  not\ndenied such information except in accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the\nAct.  <a href=\"/doc/13329432/\" id=\"a_102\">Section 2(j)</a> defines “Right to Information” conferred on all  citizens\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1979161/\" id=\"a_103\">Section 3</a> of the Act to  mean  the  right  to  information  accessible\nunder the Act, “which is  held  by  or  under  the  control  of  any  public\nauthority”.  While deciding whether a citizen should or  should  not  get  a\nparticular information “which is held by or under the control of any  public\nauthority”, the Information Commission does not  decide  a  dispute  between\ntwo or more parties concerning their legal rights other than their right  to\nget  information  in  possession  of  a  public  authority.   This  function\nobviously is  not  a  judicial  function,  but  an  administrative  function\nconferred by the Act on the Information Commissions.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_36\">21.    In  the  judgment  under  review,  this  Court  after  examining  the\nprovisions of the Act, however, has held that there is a lis to  be  decided\nby the Information Commission inasmuch as the request  of  a  party  seeking\ninformation is to be allowed or  to  be  disallowed  and  hence  requires  a\njudicial mind.  But we find that the lis  that  the  Information  Commission\nhas to decide was only with regard to the information  in  possession  of  a\npublic authority and the  Information  Commission  was  required  to  decide\nwhether the information could be given  to  the  person  asking  for  it  or\nshould be withheld in public interest or any  other  interest  protected  by\nthe provisions of the Act.  The  Information  Commission,  therefore,  while\ndeciding this lis does not really perform a judicial function, but  performs\nan administrative function in accordance with the  provisions  of  the  Act.\nAs has been held by Lord Greene, M.R. in B. Johnson &amp; Co.  (Builders),  Ltd.\nv. Minister of Health (supra):\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_49\">          “Lis, of course,  implies  the  conception  of  an  issue  joined\n          between two parties.  The decision of a lis, in the ordinary  use\n          of legal language, is the decision of that issue.   The  What  is\n          described here as a lis – the raising of the  objections  to  the\n          order, the  consideration  of  the  matters  so  raised  and  the\n          representations of the local authority and  the  objectors  –  is\n          merely a stage in the process of arriving  at  an  administrative\n          decision.  It is a  stage  which  the  courts  have  always  said\n          requires a certain method of approach and method of conduct,  but\n          it is not a lis inter partes, and for the simple reason that  the\n          local authority and the objectors are  not  parties  to  anything\n          that resembles litigation.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_37\">22.   In  the  judgment  under  review,  this  Court  has  also  held  after\nexamining the provisions of the Act that the Information Commission  decides\nmatters which may affect the rights of third  parties  and  hence  there  is\nrequirement of judicial mind.  For example, under  <a href=\"/doc/1838023/\" id=\"a_104\">Section  8(1)(d)</a>  of  the\nAct, there is no obligation  to  furnish  information  including  commercial\nconfidence, trade secrets,  or  intellectual  property,  the  disclosure  of\nwhich would harm the competitive position of the  third  party,  unless  the\ncompetent authority is satisfied that the larger  public  interest  warrants\nthe disclosure of such information.  Similarly, the right to  privacy  of  a\nthird party, which is part of his personal liberty under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_105\">Article 21</a>  of  the\nConstitution, may be breached if a particular kind  of  information,  purely\nof personal nature  may  be  directed  to  be  furnished  by  the  concerned\nauthority.  To protect the rights of third parties, <a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_106\">Section 11</a>  of  the  Act\nprovides that where a Central Public Information Officer or a  State  Public\nInformation  Officer,  as  the  case  may  be,  intends  to   disclose   any\ninformation or record or part thereof, may on a request made under the  Act,\nwhich relates to or has been supplied by a third party and has been  treated\nas confidential by that third party, a written notice will have to be  given\nto such third party inviting such party to make a submission in  writing  or\norally, regarding whether the information  should  be  disclosed,  and  such\nsubmission of the third party can be kept in view while  taking  a  decision\nabout disclosure of the information.  The  decision  taken  by  the  Central\nPublic Information Officer or the State Public Information Officer,  as  the\ncase may be, under <a href=\"/doc/641228/\" id=\"a_107\">Section 11</a> of the Act is appealable under <a href=\"/doc/593162/\" id=\"a_108\">Section  19</a>  of\nthe  Act  before  the  Information  Commission  and  when  the   Information\nCommission decides such an appeal,  it  decides  only  whether  or  not  the\ninformation should be furnished to the citizen in view of the  objection  of\nthe third party.  Here also the Information Commission does not  decide  the\nrights of a third party but only whether the information which  is  held  by\nor under the control of a public authority in relation  to  or  supplied  by\nthat third party could be furnished to a citizen  under  the  provisions  of\nthe  Act.   Hence,  the  Information  Commission  discharges  administrative\nfunctions, not judicial functions.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_38\">23.    While  performing  these  administrative  functions,   however,   the\nInformation Commissions are required to  act  in  a  fair  and  just  manner\nfollowing the procedure laid down in <a href=\"/doc/1083556/\" id=\"a_109\">Sections 18</a>, <a href=\"/doc/593162/\" id=\"a_110\">19</a>  and  <a href=\"/doc/1369783/\" id=\"a_111\">20</a>  of  the  Act.\nBut this does not mean that the Information Commissioners  are  like  Judges\nor Justices who must have judicial  experience,  training  and  acumen.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1531171\" id=\"span_14\">In\n<a href=\"/doc/1531171/\" id=\"a_112\">Harinagar Sugar Mills Ltd. v.

It may  refer  to  the\n              discharge of duties exercisable by a judge or by justices  in\n              court,  or  to  administrative  duties  which  need  not   be\n              performed in court, but in respect of which it  is  necessary\n              to bring to bear a  judicial  mind  -  that  is,  a  mind  to\n              determine what is fair and just in  respect  of  the  matters\n              under consideration.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_39\">        That  an  officer  is  required  to  decide  matters   before   him\n        &quot;judicially&quot; in the second sense does not make him a Court or  even\n        a tribunal, because that only establishes that he  is  following  a\n        standard of conduct, and is free from bias or interest.”\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_40\">   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"118255233\" id=\"span_15\">24.      Once the Court is clear  that  Information  Commissions  do  not\n   exercise judicial powers and actually discharge administrative functions,\n   the Court cannot rely on the constitutional principles of  separation  of\n   powers  and  independence  of  judiciary  to  direct   that   Information\n   Commissions must be manned by persons with judicial training,  experience\n   and acumen or former Judges of the High Court or the Supreme Court.   The\n   principles of separation of powers and independence of judiciary embodied\n   in our Constitution no  doubt  require  that  judicial  power  should  be\n   exercised by persons with judicial experience, training and acumen.   For\n   this reason, when judicial powers vested in the High Court were sought to\n   be transferred to tribunals or judicial powers are vested in tribunals by\n   an Act of the legislature, this Court has insisted that such tribunals be\n   manned by persons with judicial experience and  training,  such  as  High\n   Court Judges and District Judges of some experience.   Accordingly,  when\n   the powers of the High Court under <a href=\"/doc/1353758/\" id=\"a_113\">Companies Act, 1956</a> were sought to  be\n   transferred to Tribunals  by  the  <a href=\"/doc/1831584/\" id=\"a_114\">Companies  (Amendment)  Act,  2002</a>,  a\n   Constitution Bench of this Court has held in <a href=\"/doc/118255233/\" id=\"a_115\">Union of India v.

It is also implied that only  men  of  standing  who\n           have special expertise  in  the  field  to  which  the  Tribunal\n           relates, will be eligible for appointment as technical  members.\n           Therefore, only persons with a  judicial  background,  that  is,\n           those who have been or are Judges of the High Court and  lawyers\n           with the prescribed experience, who are eligible for appointment\n           as High Court Judges,  can  be  considered  for  appointment  as\n           judicial members.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   In <a href=\"/doc/132042/\" id=\"a_116\">Pareena Swarup v.

But, as we have seen, the powers exercised by the  Information\n   Commissions under the Act were not earlier vested in the  High  Court  or\n   subordinate court or any other court and are not  in  any  case  judicial\n   powers and therefore the Legislature need not provide for appointment  of\n   judicial members in the Information Commissions.</span>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_41\">   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"83470448\" id=\"span_17\">25.

This  “reading  into”  the\n   provisions of <a href=\"/doc/280060/\" id=\"a_127\">Sections 12(5)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1272769/\" id=\"a_128\">15(5)</a> of the Act, words which Parliament\n   has  not  intended  is  contrary   to   the   principles   of   statutory\n   interpretation recognised by this Court. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"92507\" id=\"span_18\">In <a href=\"/doc/92507/\" id=\"a_129\">Union of India and Another v.\n   Deoki Nandan Aggarwal</a> (supra) this Court has held that  the  court  could\n   not correct or make up for any deficiencies or omissions in the  language\n   of the statute. V.

The  Court\n           cannot rewrite, recast or reframe the legislation for  the  very\n           good reason that it has no power  to  legislate.  The  power  to\n           legislate has not been conferred on the courts. The Court cannot\n           add words to a statute or read  words  into  it  which  are  not\n           there. Assuming there is a defect or an omission  in  the  words\n           used by the legislature the Court could not go  to  its  aid  to\n           correct or make up the deficiency. Courts shall decide what  the\n           law is and not what it should be. The Court of course  adopts  a\n           construction which will carry out the obvious intention  of  the\n           legislature but  could  not  legislate  itself.  But  to  invoke\n           judicial activism to  set  at  naught  legislative  judgment  is\n           subversive  of  the  constitutional  harmony   and   comity   of\n           instrumentalities.”\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_43\">   27.      In the judgment under review, this Court has also held  that  if\n   <a href=\"/doc/280060/\" id=\"a_130\">Sections 12(5)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1272769/\" id=\"a_131\">15(5)</a> of the Act are not read in the manner  suggested\n   in the judgment, these Sections would offend the  doctrine  of  equality.\n   But on reading <a href=\"/doc/280060/\" id=\"a_132\">Sections 12(5)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1272769/\" id=\"a_133\">15(5)</a> of the Act, we find that it  does\n   not discriminate against any person in the matter of appointment as Chief\n   Information Commissioner and Information Commissioners and so long as one\n   is a person of eminence in public life with wide knowledge and experience\n   in law, science and technology, social service,  management,  journalism,\n   mass media or  administration  and  governance,  he  is  eligible  to  be\n   considered  for  appointment  as  Chief   Information   Commissioner   or\n   Information Commissioner.   However, to ensure that the  equality  clause\n   in <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_134\">Article  14</a>  is  not  offended,  the  persons  to  be  considered  for\n   appointment as Chief Information Commissioner or Information Commissioner\n   should be from different fields, namely,  law,  science  and  technology,\n   social service, management, journalism, mass media or administration  and\n   governance and not just from one field.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_44\">   28.      <a href=\"/doc/1089993/\" id=\"a_135\">Sections 12(6)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/962470/\" id=\"a_136\">15(6)</a> of the Act, however, provide  that  the\n   Chief Information Commissioner or an Information Commissioner  shall  not\n   be a Member of Parliament or Member of the Legislature of  any  State  or\n   Union Territory, as the case may be, or hold any other office  of  profit\n   or connected with any political party or carry on any business or  pursue\n   any profession.  There could be two interpretations of <a href=\"/doc/1089993/\" id=\"a_137\">Sections 12(6)</a> and\n   <a href=\"/doc/962470/\" id=\"a_138\">15(6)</a> of  the  Act.   One  interpretation  could  be  that  a  Member  of\n   Parliament or Member of the Legislature of any State or Union  Territory,\n   as the case may be, or a person holding any other  office  of  profit  or\n   connected with any  political  party  or  carrying  on  any  business  or\n   pursuing any profession  will  not  be  eligible  to  be  considered  for\n   appointment  as  a  Chief  Information   Commissioner   and   Information\n   Commissioner.  If this interpretation is  given  to  <a href=\"/doc/1089993/\" id=\"a_139\">Sections  12(6)</a>  and\n   <a href=\"/doc/962470/\" id=\"a_140\">15(6)</a> of the Act, then it will obviously offend the  equality  clause  in\n   <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_141\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution as  it  debars  such  persons  from  being\n   considered  for  appointment  as  Chief  Information   Commissioner   and\n   Information Commissioners.  The second interpretation of  <a href=\"/doc/1089993/\" id=\"a_142\">Sections  12(6)</a>\n   and <a href=\"/doc/962470/\" id=\"a_143\">15(6)</a> of the Act could be that once a person is appointed as a  Chief\n   Information Commissioner or Information Commissioner, he cannot  continue\n   to be a Member of Parliament or Member of the Legislature of any State or\n   Union Territory, as the case may be, or hold any other office  of  profit\n   or remain connected with any political party or carry on any business  or\n   pursue any profession.  If this interpretation is given to <a href=\"/doc/1089993/\" id=\"a_144\">Sections 12(6)</a>\n   and <a href=\"/doc/962470/\" id=\"a_145\">15(6)</a> of the Act then the interpretation would effectuate the  object\n   of the Act inasmuch as Chief  Information  Commissioner  and  Information\n   Commissioners would be able to perform their functions in the Information\n   Commission  without  being  influenced  by  their  political,   business,\n   professional or other interests.  It is  this  second  interpretation  of\n   <a href=\"/doc/1089993/\" id=\"a_146\">Sections 12(6)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/962470/\" id=\"a_147\">15(6)</a> of the Act which has been rightly given  in  the\n   judgment under review and <a href=\"/doc/1089993/\" id=\"a_148\">Sections 12(6)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/962470/\" id=\"a_149\">15(6)</a> of the Act  have  been\n   held  as  not  to  be  violative  of  <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_150\">Article  14</a>  of  the  Constitution.\n   Therefore, the argument of Mr. Sharma, learned counsel for the respondent-\n   writ petitioner, that if we do not read <a href=\"/doc/280060/\" id=\"a_151\">Sections 12(5)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1272769/\" id=\"a_152\">15(5)</a>  of  the\n   Act in the manner suggested in the judgment under review, the  provisions\n   of <a href=\"/doc/280060/\" id=\"a_153\">Sections 12(5)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1272769/\" id=\"a_154\">15(5)</a> of the Act would be ultra vires  the  <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_155\">Article\n   14</a> of the Constitution, is misconceived.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_45\">   29.      In the judgment under review, in  direction  no.5,  the  Central\n   Government and/or the competent authority have been directed to frame all\n   practice and procedure related rules to make working of  the  Information\n   Commissions effective and in consonance with the basic rule  of  law  and\n   with particular reference to <a href=\"/doc/773502/\" id=\"a_156\">Sections 27</a> and  <a href=\"/doc/1606088/\" id=\"a_157\">28</a>  of  the  Act  within  a\n   period of six months.  <a href=\"/doc/761000/\" id=\"a_158\">Sections 27(1)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/747911/\" id=\"a_159\">28(1)</a> of the Act are  extracted\n   hereinbelow:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_55\">           “27.

Power  to  make  rules  by  competent  authority.—(1)   The\n           competent  authority  may,  by  notification  in  the   Official\n           Gazette, make rules to carry out the provisions of this Act.”\n\n\n\nThe use of word “may” in <a href=\"/doc/773502/\" id=\"a_160\">Sections 27</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1606088/\" id=\"a_161\">28</a> of the Act make  it  clear  that\nParliament has left it to the discretion of the  rule  making  authority  to\nmake rules to carry out the provisions of the Act.  Hence, no  mandamus  can\nbe issued to the rule making authority to make the  rules  either  within  a\nspecific time or in a particular manner.  If, however, the  rules  are  made\nby the rule making authority and the rules are not in  accordance  with  the\nprovisions of the Act, the Court can strike down such rules as  ultra  vires\nthe Act, but the Court cannot direct the rule making authority to  make  the\nrules where the Legislature confers discretion on the rule making  authority\nto make rules.  In the judgment under review, therefore, this Court  made  a\npatent error in directing the rule making authority to make rules  within  a\nperiod of six months.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_46\">30.   Nonetheless,  the  selection  and  appointment  of  Chief  Information\nCommissioner and Information Commissioners has not  been  left  entirely  to\nthe discretion of the Central Government  and  the  State  Government  under\n<a href=\"/doc/127781/\" id=\"a_162\">Sections 12</a> and <a href=\"/doc/762785/\" id=\"a_163\">15</a> of the Act.  <a href=\"/doc/372537/\" id=\"a_164\">Sections 12(3)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1358055/\" id=\"a_165\">15(3)</a>  provide  that  the\nChief  Information  Commissioner  and  Information  Commissioners  shall  be\nappointed by the President or the Governor, as  the  case  may  be,  on  the\nrecommendation of the Committee named therein.   <a href=\"/doc/280060/\" id=\"a_166\">Sections  12(5)</a>  and  <a href=\"/doc/1272769/\" id=\"a_167\">15(5)</a>\nprovide that Chief Information Commissioner  and  Information  Commissioners\nhave to be persons of eminence  in  public  life  with  wide  knowledge  and\nexperience in the different fields mentioned therein, namely,  law,  science\nand technology,  social  service,  management,  journalism,  mass  media  or\nadministration and governance.  Thus, the basic requirement for a person  to\nbe  appointed  as  a   Chief   Information   Commissioner   or   Information\nCommissioner is that he should be a person of eminence in public  life  with\nwide knowledge  and  experience  in  a  particular  field.   Parliament  has\ninsisted on this basic requirement having regard to the functions  that  the\nChief Information Commissioner and Information  Commissioners  are  required\nto perform under the Act.  As the preamble  of  the  Act  states,  democracy\nrequires an informed citizenry and transparency  of  information  which  are\nvital to its functioning and also requires that corruption is contained  and\nGovernments  and  their  instrumentalities  are  held  accountable  to   the\ngoverned.  The preamble of the Act, however,  cautions  that  revelation  of\ninformation in actual practice is  likely  to  conflict  with  other  public\ninterests including efficient operations of the Governments, optimum use  of\nlimited  fiscal  resources  and  the  preservation  of  confidentiality   of\nsensitive information.   Moreover, under the Act, a citizen  has  the  right\nto information held or under the  control  of  public  authority  and  hence\nInformation Commissioners are to ensure that the right to privacy of  person\nprotected  under  <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_168\">Article  21</a>  of  the  Constitution  is  not  affected   by\nfurnishing any particular information.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_47\">31.     Unfortunately, experience over the years has shown that  the  orders\npassed by Information Commissions have at times gone beyond  the  provisions\nof the Act and that Information Commissions have not been able to  harmonise\nthe conflicting interests indicated in the preamble and other provisions  of\nthe Act.  The reasons for this  experience  about  the  functioning  of  the\nInformation Commissions could be either that persons who do not  answer  the\ncriteria mentioned in <a href=\"/doc/280060/\" id=\"a_169\">Sections 12(5)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1272769/\" id=\"a_170\">15(5)</a> have been appointed as  Chief\nInformation Commissioner or Information Commissioners or  that  the  persons\nappointed answer the criteria <a href=\"/doc/92507/\" id=\"a_171\">laid down in</a> <a href=\"/doc/280060/\" id=\"a_172\">Sections 12(5)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1272769/\" id=\"a_173\">15(5)</a>  of  the\nAct but they do  not  have  the  required  mind  to  balance  the  interests\nindicated in the Act and to  restrain  themselves  from  acting  beyond  the\nprovisions  of  the  Act.   This  experience  of  the  functioning  of   the\nInformation Commissions prompted this Court to issue the directions  in  the\njudgment under  review  to  appoint  judicial  members  in  the  Information\nCommissions.  But it is for Parliament to consider  whether  appointment  of\njudicial  members  in  the  Information   Commissions   will   improve   the\nfunctioning of the Information Commissions and as <a href=\"/doc/280060/\" id=\"a_174\">Sections 12(5)</a>  and  <a href=\"/doc/1272769/\" id=\"a_175\">15(5)</a>\nof the Act do not  provide  for  appointment  of  judicial  members  in  the\nInformation Commissions, this direction was  an  apparent  error.   <a href=\"/doc/280060/\" id=\"a_176\">Sections\n12(5)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1272769/\" id=\"a_177\">15(5)</a> of the Act, however,  provide  for  appointment  of  persons\nwith wide knowledge and experience in law.  We hope that persons  with  wide\nknowledge and experience  in  law  will  be  appointed  in  the  Information\nCommissions at the Centre  and  the  States.
