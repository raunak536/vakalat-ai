NAVEEN RAO          \nCIVIL REVISION PETITION No. 2129 OF 2014     \n\nORDER:</pre>  \n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_1\">        This revision is filed aggrieved by the order dated 27.6.2014 passed in\nI.A. No. 751 of 2014 in E.O.P No. 284 of 2014 on the file of the Principal\nDistrict\nJudge, Karimnagar, where-under petition filed under Order 26 Rule 10 (A) <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_1\">of CPC</a>\nr/w <a href=\"/doc/1025384/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 45</a> of Evidence Act and <a href=\"/doc/56600062/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 151</a> of CPC was allowed and second  \nrespondent /second petitioner herein was directed to subject herself to medical\nexamination by a doctor (Gynecologist) of her choice accompanied by a\nGynecologist nominated by the Superintendent, Government District \nHeadquarters Hospital, Karimnagar to know her present health condition and to\nknow whether she gave birth to a child recently by undergoing caesarean\noperation.   Further direction was issued to second respondent to make herself\navailable for medical examination on the date and time as fixed by the two\ndoctors.  Revision petitioners are respondents 1 and 2 in I.A. No. 751 of 2014.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_2\">        2.      Elections to the municipal corporation of Karimnagar were\nconducted on 30.3.2014, wherein first petitioner and first respondent  herein\ncontested for post of Ward Member of 39th ward.  The results of the said\nelections were declared on 12.5.2014 and first petitioner was declared elected\nand first respondent stood as second candidate.  First respondent filed E.O.P.\nNo.\n284 of 2014 on the file of the Principal District Judge, Karimnagar challenging\nthe\nelection of first petitioner.  One of the grounds of challenge in the E.O.P.\nagainst\nthe election of first petitioner was that first petitioner was father of three\nchildren, therefore earned disqualification to contest the election as a Ward\nMember of the Municipal Corporation and his election should be declared\nnullified.  Reliance was placed on provision in <a href=\"/doc/17893983/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 21 (B)</a> of The Greater\nHyderabad Municipal Corporation Act, 1955 (for short the Act ) which prescribe\nineligibility to contest for municipal corporation election or to continue as a\nMember, if a person is blessed with more than two children.   It was contended\nthat third child was born to revision petitioners on 2.4.2014 in Apollo Nursing\nHome, Karimnagar and named as Mahek Fathima, but in the hospital records,  \nthe names of the parents was wrongly shown though the child was actually born\nto the revision petitioners.   Birth of Mahek Fathima in Apollo Nursing Home is\nsupported by a certificate issued by the Registrar of Births and Deaths.   It\nwas \nthe case of the first respondent that he has no other evidence to show that\nthird\nchild was born to petitioners which would be a disqualification and to nullify\nthe\nelection of first petitioner it is necessary to ascertain whether the second\npetitioner has given birth to a child on 2.4.2014 by undergoing a caesarean\noperation.   Since there is no other evidence available to him, to ascertain\nthe\ntruth it is necessary to by subject the second petitioner to medical examination\nto know whether second petitioner had undergone caesarean operation in recent\npast to give birth to a child and for that purpose filed I A No. 751 of 2014.\nHaving considered the rival submissions, the learned Principal District Judge,\npassed orders on 27.6.2014 directing such medical examination.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_3\">        3.      Learned senior counsel Sri S Satyam Reddy, appearing for revision\npetitioners contended that the order of the Court below is contrary to law and\nis\nerroneous.   He further contended that no such application under <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_5\">Order 26 Rule\n10 of CPC</a> is maintainable.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_4\">      4.        Learned senior counsel further contended that what is challenged\nin E.O.P. No. 284 of 2014 was the validity of the election of the first\npetitioner\nand the lis is between first petitioner and first respondent and second\npetitioner\nis no-way concerned with the election and therefore, an unconcerned party,\ncannot be directed to undergo medical examination  for the purpose of\nascertaining truth of giving birth to a child.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_5\">      5.        He further contended that the order under revision offends the\nright of privacy and decency of a women and no such order could have been\npassed without her consent.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_6\">      6.        He further contended that election petition is in the nature of\ncriminal proceedings and burden lies on the election petitioner to establish\nthat\nthe candidate elected has violated the provisions of laws governing the election\nwith cogent evidence and proof in support of his contention.  He cannot make\nvague allegations and try to build up evidence by subjecting the other party or\nfamily members of other party to undergo medical examination.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_7\">      7.        Burden lies on the election petitioner/first respondent  to prove\nthat\nrevision petitioners have given birth to a child on 2.4.2014 and on that account\nfirst petitioner earned disqualification to contest the election and  therefore\nhis\nelection must be nullified.  In support of his contentions, learned senior\ncounsel \nplaced reliance on following decisions:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"338008\" id=\"span_1\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"547362\" id=\"span_2\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1807341\" id=\"span_3\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"588738\" id=\"span_4\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"80510634\" id=\"span_5\"><a href=\"/doc/80510634/\" id=\"a_6\">B.RAVI YADAV Vs CHERKULA UDAY KUMAR AND OTHERS</a> ,              \n<a href=\"/doc/588738/\" id=\"a_7\">BALDEV SINGH MANN Vs SURJIT SINGH DHIMAN</a> , <a href=\"/doc/1807341/\" id=\"a_8\">SANTOSH YADAV               \nVs NARENDER SINGH</a> , LAGADAPATI RAJA GOPAL Vs SUNKARA               \nKRISHNA MURTHY AND OTHERS , <a href=\"/doc/547362/\" id=\"a_9\">R.RAJAGOPAL Vs STATE OF T.N AND                \nOTHERS</a>  <a href=\"/doc/338008/\" id=\"a_10\">AND SELVI AND OTHERS Vs STATE OF KARNATAKA</a> .</span></span></span></span></span>              \n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_8\">        8.      Sri C.Hari Preeth learned counsel appearing for first respondent\ndefends the order passed by the Court below.  He contended that petitioners\nhave given birth to a child on 2.4.2014 but to suppress the information of\ngiving\nbirth to a child, with the help of the Doctors who attended the second\npetitioner\nin ensuring the birth of a child, have manipulated the medical records of the\nhospital and shown names of other persons as parents to the child born on\n2.4.2014.  He further contended that since the records were manipulated,\nelection petitioner has no other material to substantiate his claim, though he\nstrongly believes that first petitioner is father of three children, therefore\nearned \ndisqualification under <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 21-B</a> of the Act and since first respondent has no\nother material to substantiate the allegations and the factum of giving birth to\nthird child is crucial to the issue involved in the case, first respondent has\nsought \nfor medical examination of the second petitioner herein, so that truth would\ncome to light.   The medical examination is only for the purpose of ascertaining\nwhether second petitioner has undergone operation to give birth to a child and\nnothing more and only an expert can evaluate and give a repot to that extent\nand to ascertain the truth the Court is entitled to pass such orders.   He\nfurther\ncontended that the order does not violate the right of privacy and human dignity\nof second petitioner and does not offend <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_12\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of\nIndia.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"160470236\" id=\"span_6\">In support of his contentions, learned counsel placed reliance on decision of\nSupreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/160470236/\" id=\"a_13\">SHARDA Vs DHARMPAL</a> .</span>       \n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_10\">        9.      The issue that arises for consideration in this revision is whether\neven before the commencement of trial, can Trial Court order medical\nexamination of a person who is unconcerned with the election petition against\nher will and consent?\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_11\">        10.     In SANTOSH YADAV and BALDEV SINGH MANN, Supreme            \nCourt held that standard of proof is high and burden of proof is on the election\npetitioner to prove an allegation.  Mere preponderance of probabilities are not\nenough, as may be the case in a civil dispute.  Allegations should be clear and\nprecise and charge should be proved to the hilt as in a criminal trial by clear,\ncogent and credible evidence.  In SANTOSH YADAV, Supreme Court     \nsummarized the principles on improper acceptance of nominations.  It is held\nthat case has to be made out by raising specific pleadings setting out all\nmaterial\nfacts and adducing cogent evidence so as to enable a clear finding being arrived\nat.   The burden of proving such material fact has to be discharged by the\nelection petitioner by adducing positive, satisfactory and cogent evidence.  If\npetitioner is unable to adduce such evidence the burden is not discharged and\nthe election must stand.   Difficulty of proof cannot obviate the need of strict\nproof or relax the rigour of required proof.  The burden of proof placed on the\nelection petitioner is very strict and so difficult to discharge as nearing\nalmost \nimpossibility.  There is no room for any guesswork, speculation, surmises or\nconjectures i.e., acting on a mere possibility.  The law requires proof.  How\nfar\nthat proof should go or what it should contain is not provided by the\nlegislature.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\">        11.     In B RAVI YADAV, Division Bench of this Court held as under:\n</p>        \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">To  prove  the  charge  of  corrupt  practice  a mere\npreponderance of probabilities would not be enough. There would be\na  presumption  of  innocence  available  to  the  person  charged.\nThe charge shall have to be proved to the hilt, the standard of proof\nbeing the same as in a criminal trial.  It is further held by the Apex\nCourt that the success of a candidate who has won at an election\nshould not be lightly  interfered  with.   Any  petition  seeking  such\ninterference  must strictly conform to the requirements of the law.\nThough the purity of the election process has to be safeguarded and\nthe Court shall be vigilant to see that people do not get elected by\nflagrant breaches of law or by committing corrupt practices,  the\nsetting aside of an election  involves serious  consequences  not  only\nfor  the  returned  candidate  and  the constituency, but also  for  the\npublic at  large  inasmuch as  re-election involves an enormous load\non the public funds and administration.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">      12.       The above decisions are followed by this Court in LAGADAPATI\nRAJA GOPAL.   This Court held It is not the same thing as proof which comes\nlater that the Court has to find whether the accused is guilty.  It signifies\nthat on\nfirst examination the matter appears to be self evident from the facts.  In\ncommon law jurisprudence, prima facie case denotes evidence which (unless \nrebutted) would be sufficient to prove a particular proposition or fact.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\">      It is further held:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\"> The Court has to be watchful and ensure that conjectures or\nsuspicions do not take the place of legal proof, but at the time\nof framing charge in a criminal case, what is required to be seen\nis whether the charge-sheet and the documents  relied upon\nincluding the FIR and the statement of witnesses, if accepted as\ntrue at that stage would constitute a prima facie case.  Prima\nfacie evidence means, on the face of it, there is a ground for\nproceeding.  It is not the same thing as proof which comes later\nthat the Court has to find whether the accused is guilty.  It\nsignifies that on first examination the matter appears to be self\nevident from the facts.  In common law jurisprudence, prima\nfacie case denotes evidence which (unless rebutted) would be\nsufficient to prove a particular proposition or fact.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\">     13.        R.RAJAGOPAL  is a case concerning right of privacy vis--vis\nfreedom of press.  Supreme Court summarized broad principles and held as \nunder:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">   26. We may now summarise the broad principles flowing from\nthe above discussion:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">   (1) The right to privacy is implicit in the right to life and liberty\nguaranteed to the citizens of this country by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_14\">Article 21.</a> It is a right to\nbe let alone. A citizen has a right to safeguard the privacy of his own,\n his family, marriage, procreation, motherhood, child-bearing and\neducation among other matters. None can publish anything \nconcerning the above matters without his consent  whether truthful\nor otherwise and whether laudatory or critical. If he does so, he would\nbe violating the right to privacy of the person concerned and would be\nliable in an action for damages. Position may, however, be different, if\na person voluntarily thrusts himself into controversy or voluntarily\ninvites or raises a controversy.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\">        14.     The decision relied upon by the learned counsel for first respondent\nis concerning an application for divorce, wherein an application was filed for\ndirection for medical examination of the respondent.   The question that fell\nfor\nconsideration by the Supreme Court was whether the party to divorce\nproceedings can be compelled to medical examination.  Supreme Court held as  \nunder:\n</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">   32. Yet again the primary duty of a court is to see that truth is\narrived at. A party to a civil litigation, it is axiomatic, is not entitled to\nconstitutional protections under <a href=\"/doc/655638/\" id=\"a_15\">Article 20</a> of the Constitution of India.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_17\">Thus, the civil court although may not have any specific provisions in\n<a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_16\">the Code of Civil Procedure</a> and the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_17\">Evidence Act</a>, has an inherent\npower in terms of <a href=\"/doc/56600062/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 151</a> of the  Code of Civil Procedure to pass\nall orders for doing complete justice to the parties to the suit.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_18\">   33. Discretionary power under <a href=\"/doc/56600062/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 151</a> of the Code of Civil\nProcedure, it is trite, can be exercised also on an application filed by\nthe party.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\">   34. In certain cases medical examination by the experts in the\nfield may not only be found to be leading to the truth of the matter\nbut may also lead to removal of misunderstanding between the\nparties. It may bring the parties to terms.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_20\">   35. Having regard to development in medicinal technology, it is\npossible to find out that what was presumed to be a mental disorder\nof a spouse is not really so.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\">   36. In matrimonial disputes, the court has also a conciliatory role\nto play  even for the said purpose it may require expert advice.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_22\">   37. Under <a href=\"/doc/69984823/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 75(e)</a> of the Code of Civil Procedure and Order\n26 Rule 10-A the civil court has the requisite power to issue a direction\nto hold a scientific, technical or expert investigation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_23\">        15.     In SELVI , Supreme Court on review of the entire case law on\nissue of subjecting a person to Narcoanalysis, polygraph test (lie-detector\ntest)\nand BEAP (Brain Electrical Activation Profile) test, held that test results\ncannot be \nadmitted in evidence if they have been obtained through the use of compulsion.\n<a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_21\">Article 20 (3)</a> protects an individuals choice between speaking and remaining\nsilent, irrespective of whether the subsequent testimony proves to be\ninculpatory\nor exculpatory.   <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_22\">Article 20 (3)</a> aims to prevent the forcible conveyance of\npersonal knowledge that is relevant to the facts in issue.   The results\nobtained\nfrom each of the impugned tests bear a testimonial character and they cannot\nbe categorised as material evidence.    It is further held that We have also\nelaborated how the compulsory administration of any of these techniques is an\nunjustified intrusion into the mental privacy of an individual.  It would also\namount to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment with regard to the language\nof evolving international human rights norms.  (para 263).   It is further held\nthat no individual should be forcibly subjected to any of the techniques in\nquestion, whether in the contest of investigation in criminal cases or\notherwise.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">Doing so would amount to  an unwarranted intrusion into personal liberty.\n(para 264).     \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_25\">        16.     Right to privacy is implicit in right to life  and liberty as\nenshrined in\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_23\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India.   No persons privacy can be invaded\nmuch \nagainst the consent and will of that person.  Certain exceptions to this rigid\nprinciple are carved out where larger public interest is involved and in matters\nconcerning matrimonial cases.    It is held that a person who is alleged to have\nbeen suffering with HIV disease can be subjected to medical examination even\nagainst his will as it is necessary to know his medical condition since it is\nlikely\naffect life of others also.  Similarly, in personal law concerning relationship\nof\nhusband and wife and the children born to such wedlock, the right to privacy is\ninvaded to ascertain whether the marriage was consumed properly, whether the\nspouses to the marriage are suitable to live together or suffering from any\ndisease which disentitles them to live as husband and wife. In matters where a\nmarriage is sought to be nullified also it may be necessary to ascertain the\nhealth\nof one of the spouses of the marriage etc.   To ascertain the birth of a child\nto\nthe couple, DNA test can be ordered.  Similarly, when it comes to the custody of\na child, the mental condition of the spouse is also necessarily to be\nascertained\nbefore Court orders the custody of the child to one of the parents.  In all such\ncircumstances, subjecting a person to medical examination does not amount to \nviolating right of privacy.  These are exceptions to normal rule.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\">      17.       As held by the Supreme Court in SANTOSH YADAV AND\nBALDEV SINGH MANN  and this Court in  LAGADAPATI RAJA GOPAL, in         \nelection  matters the standard of proof is high and burden is on the  election\npetitioner.  Mere preponderance of probabilities or  presumptions cannot be the\nbasis to challenge an election.  The election proceedings are akin to criminal\nproceedings.  In view of the above proposition of law on the subject, the burden\nlies on the first respondent to make specific allegation and lead evidence in\nsupport of said allegation.  Petitioner in Election Petition cannot  seek to\nelicit\nsuch information by subjecting a non-party to the election to medical\nexamination.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_27\">      18.       In R.RAJAGOPAL, Supreme Court held that a citizen has a right to\nsafeguard the privacy of procreation, motherhood, child bearing and education\namong others. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_28\">      19.       A woman has a right to be silent, not to disclose about giving birth\nto a child.   No person can compel a woman to give up this right much against\nher will.    The case on hand does not fall into the exceptions carved out from\nthe normal principle on right to privacy, more particularly, when the woman is\nnot the person elected and is a stranger to the issue of earning\ndisqualification\nby an elected candidate.  A wrong declaration and a resultant disqualification\nrelates to the first petitioner.  Second petitioner is no way concerned.  She is\na\nstranger to the election dispute.  Thus, she cannot be compelled to undergo\nmedical examination against her will.   Certainly subjecting the second\npetitioner\nto medical examination would offend her personal liberty, privacy and dignity of\nperson  that is bestowed on second petitioner as a woman. There can be many \nreasons where the woman would genuinely wish to keep the issue of giving birth\nto a child not disclosed.   By virtue of subjecting her to medical examination\nat\nthe  instance of the petitioner in election petition, the factum of giving birth\nto\nor otherwise  would be in public domain  and would  be against  the  conscience\nand will of the person concerned and  can have  deleterious  effect  which\ncannot \nbe repaired. The consequence of such medical examination can be far and wide.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_29\">      20.       The Civil Revision Petition is allowed.  Order of  the Principal\nDistrict\nJudge, Karimnagar in I.A. No. 751 of 2014 in E.O.P No. 284 of 2014 dated\n27.6.2014 is set aside.
