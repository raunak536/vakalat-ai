Be it noted, though there were three writ petitions and\n\n           three appeals have been preferred against the common order passed\n\n           by the learned Single Judge, yet the factual exposition in all the cases\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                  -7-</span>\n\n\n\n\nhas an inseparable thread of commonality and, therefore, it is\n\napposite to adumbrate the facts in singular compartment.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">3.          Eighteen Councillors of Madhubani Nagar Parishad\n\nfiled requisition for convening special meeting of the Nagar Parishad\n\nfor considering of the vote of no confidence against the Chief\n\nCouncillor as well as the Deputy Chief Councillor. On the basis of\n\nthe requisition, the Chief Councillor fixed the meeting to 16.07.2009\n\nand noticed the Councillors. On the 09th of July, 2009, the in-charge\n\nAdditional Collector informed the Chief Executive Officer of the\n\nNagar Parishad that in view of the order dated 08.07.2009 of the\n\nDistrict Magistrate, Madhubani, the special meeting relating to the\n\nvote of no confidence against the Chief Councillor and the Deputy\n\nChief Councillor should be adjourned to 10.30 a.m. on 17.07.2009\n\nand the said meeting should be held at the Vikash Bhawan. It is the\n\nadmitted position that the Collector-cum-District Magistrate had\n\nreceived the earlier communication from the Nagar Parishad in\n\nwhich the meeting was fixed to 16.07.2009. As the Collector-cum-\n\nDistrict Magistrate had no role in the scheme of the Act, the said\n\norder passed by the Collector came to be challenged in CWJC\n\nno.8075 of 2009. The writ petition came to be filed by the petitioners\n\nwho are the Chief Councilor and the Deputy Chief Councillor.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                   -8-</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_5\">4.           In CWJC No.7646 of 2009, a Ward Member assailed\n\nthe notice containing memo no. 442 dated 01.07.2009 issued by the\n\nExecutive Officer, Nagar Parishad, Madhubani by which he had\n\ndirected the Chief Councillor to call a meeting on 16.07.2009 at\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_6\">11.a.m. for consideration of the no confidence motion. The notice\n\nissued by the Executive Officer contained the circular issued by the\n\nState Government, as contained in memo no.2360 dated 22.06.2009,\n\nwherein it has been stipulated that the meeting would be held as per\n\nthe procedure laid down in the said circular. Be it noted, the said\n\ncircular has been issued by the Principal Secretary, Department of\n\nUrban Development and Housing. The writ petitioner challenged the\n\ncircular on the ground that in the said circular, it has been stipulated\n\nthat once a notice has been given for holding a meeting of no\n\nconfidence motion, the same shall not be postponed and for\n\ndiscussion on the motion, there would be no necessity for a quorum.\n\nTo put it otherwise, it has been conveyed by the circular that the\n\nmeeting of no confidence would be allowed to continue even if the\n\nminimum quorum is not fulfilled. It was contended that the authority\n\nhad no power to issue such a circular as that would run counter to the\n\nmandate of the statute.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_7\">5.    In CWJC No.7567 of 2009 filed by the petitioner-Chief\n\nCouncillor of the Municipal Council,it was stated that after getting\n\nthe information from the Chief Executive Officer, he had instructed on\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                   -9-</span>\n\n\n\n\n22.06.2009 for convening the meeting of the council on 16.07.2009,\n\nbut the same was adjourned by the Collector placing reliance on the\n\ncircular dated 22.06.2009 which had no legs to stand upon. It was\n\nalso urged that the District Magistrate had no right to change the date\n\nor to preside over the meeting. It was also contended that in the\n\nabsence of any framing of rules as mandated under <a href=\"/doc/111982469/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 25(4)</a> of\n\nthe Act, vote of no confidence motion could not be mooted.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_8\">6.           A counter affidavit was filed by the answering\n\nrespondents contending, inter alia, that in the absence of the statutory\n\nrule, the State was competent to issue circular which would have\n\nforce of the rule. The said circular provides that where there is no\n\nconfidence motion against the Chief Councillor and the Deputy\n\nChief Councillor simultaneously, the meeting would be called for by\n\nthe Collector of the District and would be presided over by him and\n\nconvened under his supervision or under his delegated authority. It\n\nfurther provides that for such a special meeting, there would be no\n\nrequirement of quorum. It was put forth that as no procedure is\n\nenvisaged in the Act how a vote of no confidence motion is to be\n\nmoved and mooted when there is a requisition against both the Chief\n\nCouncillor and the Deputy Chief Councillor, the said circular was\n\nissued to fill up the lacuna.

Before we proceed to state about the conclusions\n\narrived at by the learned Single Judge, it is apt to mention that on\n\n16.07.2009 in CWJC No.8075 of 2009 wherein the postponement of\n\nthe meeting by the District Magistrate vide communication dated\n\n09th July, 2009 was assailed, the said order was stayed and further it\n\nwas directed status quo prior to the holding of the meeting of no\n\nconfidence motion fixed for the date, i.e., 16.07.2009, shall be\n\nmaintained.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_12\">8.              The learned Single Judge, after hearing the learned\n\ncounsel for the parties, came to hold that the notification issued by\n\nthe State Government vide memo no.2360 dated 22.06.2009 making\n\nprovision for holding of special meeting is totally contrary to the\n\nprovisions contained in <a href=\"/doc/111982469/\" id=\"a_4\">Sections 25(4)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/26146450/\" id=\"a_5\">51</a> of the Act and,\n\ntherefore, cannot be accepted to remain in force and the State\n\nGovernment in the guise of issuing executive instructions cannot\n\nusurp the statutory provision. He has further opined that the Act\n\nitself takes care about the person who would preside over the\n\nmeeting under <a href=\"/doc/26146450/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 51</a> of the Act and, hence, the District\n\nMagistrate could not have been conferred the power by executive\n\ninstruction more so in the absence of a rule.

Being of this view, the learned Single Judge came to hold\n\nthat the meeting could not have been adjourned by the District\n\nMagistrate. After so holding, it has been noted by him that by order\n\ndated 16.07.2009, the writ court had stayed the communication of\n\nthe Collector and a meeting was held by the Chief Councillor on that\n\nday and the same was attended by 12 members. The learned Single\n\nJudge further took note of the fact that once the meeting was\n\nadjourned by the District Magistrate and due to the interim order\n\npassed on 16.07.2009 in which parties were not represented the\n\nmeeting was held, it cannot be regarded as a notice to all. He further\n\ntook note of the fact that the Chief Councillor and the Deputy Chief\n\nCouncillor after obtaining the interim order immediately held the\n\nmeeting on the same day and, therefore, the resolution passed therein\n\ncannot be treated to be proper resolution passed in a valid meeting\n\nand, accordingly, it directed the Chief Councillor to fix and notify a\n\nspecial meeting, with the agenda with regard to no confidence\n\nmotion against him and the Deputy Chief Councillor in accordance\n\nwith the requisition, as received and seek confidence of the House\n\nwithin the period as has been provided in the Act.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">                                  - 12 -\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_13\">9.

It is not in dispute that the State Government has not\n\nframed the rules. In the absence of the rules, a circular has been\n\nissued by the Under Secretary, Department of Urban Development,\n\nGovt. of Bihar, Patna. The said circular in various clauses has laid\n\ndown certain conditions which have been discussed by the learned\n\nsingle Judge at length. In Clause 4 of the said circular, there is a\n\nstipulation that no quorum would be necessary. The said stipulation\n\nis in flagrant violation of the statutory provisions and cannot be held\n\nto be valid. That apart, the said circular confers power on the District\n\nMagistrate.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_25\">13.           <a href=\"/doc/125368290/\" id=\"a_9\">Chapter VII of the Act</a> in Part-A deals with Transaction\n\nof Business by Municipality. <a href=\"/doc/26146450/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 51</a> which occurs in the said\n\nprovision reads as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">          &quot;51.Presiding officer of a meeting of Municipality.-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">          (1) The Chief Councillor shall preside at every\n          meeting of the Municipality and in his absence the\n          Deputy Chief Councillor shall preside the meeting:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">          Provided that when a meeting is held to consider a\n          motion for the removal of the Chief Councillor, the\n          Chief Councillor shall not preside at such meeting.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">          (2) The Chief Councillor, or the person presiding over\n          a meeting of the Municipality, shall also have, and\n          may exercise, a casting vote in all cases of equality of\n          votes&quot;.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_26\">14.           On a reading of the said provision, it is clear as day that\n\nthe Chief Councillor shall preside over the meeting and in his\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_27\">                                  - 16 -\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_28\">\n\n\nabsence, the Deputy Chief Councillor shall do so. In the proviso, an\n\nexception has been carved out that the Chief Councillor shall not\n\npreside at such a meeting if the meeting has been convened to\n\nconsider a motion for his removal. Sub-section (2) empowers the\n\nChief Councillor or the person presiding over a meeting of the\n\nMunicipality to exercise a casting vote in all cases of equality of\n\nvotes. It can be stated by applying the deductive method that a\n\nperson who has power to cast his vote can only preside over the\n\nmeeting. If the scheme of the Act is read in proper perspective, there\n\ncan be no scintilla of doubt that a Chief Councillor who has power to\n\nparticipate in the transaction has power to vote. Thus, a Chief\n\nCouncillor can, under certain circumstances, be asked to preside over\n\nthe meeting. Such a contingency can be met with if there is a\n\nrequisition to moot a motion of no confidence against the Chief\n\nCouncillor and the Deputy Chief Councillor.          No role can be\n\nascribed to any person from the executive to preside over such a\n\nmeeting. True it is, there are provisions in certain statutes where a\n\nmeeting is held in the presence of the Executive Officer of the\n\nMunicipality or by a Sub Divisional Officer or even by the District\n\nMagistrate, but in the said provisions, no power is conferred on them\n\nfor casting vote in case of equality of votes but Section 51 of the Act\n\nhas been differently couched and, therefore, the only conclusion that\n\ncan be arrived at is that a meeting has to be presided over by the\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_29\">                                     - 17 -\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_30\">\n\n\nChief Councillor or the Deputy Councillor or the Councillor which\n\nwould be in apposite and in fitness of thing in a democratic set up\n\nregard being had to the power conferred on the Municipalities under\n\nthe Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_31\">15.           In view of the aforesaid, the plea of the State Government\n\nthat to meet a contingency of this nature, the executive instruction\n\nwas issued does not deserve acceptance and, accordingly, we concur\n\nwith the finding of the learned single Judge on that score.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_32\">16.                It is next contended by the learned counsel for the\n\nappellants that in the absence of a rule as provided under <a href=\"/doc/111982469/\" id=\"a_11\">Section\n\n25(4)</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/76218358/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 2(76)</a> of the Act, no meeting can be held for\n\nmooting a motion of no confidence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_33\">17.

Since we agree with the view of the High\n       Court that professional and technical educational\n       institutions are not covered by the Act and the Rules,\n       we do not consider it necessary to go into the question\n       whether the provisions of the Act fall within the ambit\n       of Entry 25 or List III and do not relate to Entry 66 of\n       List I.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_35\">18.

One has,\n        therefore, to look at the entire scheme of the <a href=\"/doc/1353758/\" id=\"a_40\">Companies\n        Act</a>. In our view, the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1353758/\" id=\"a_41\">Companies Act</a>\n        together with the Rules framed by the Central\n        Government constitute a complete scheme. Without the\n        Rules, the Companies Act cannot be implemented. The\n        impugned Rules framed under <a href=\"/doc/1154644/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 642</a> are a\n        legitimate aid to construction of the <a href=\"/doc/1353758/\" id=\"a_43\">Companies Act</a> as\n        contemporanea expositio. Many of the provisions of the\n        <a href=\"/doc/1353758/\" id=\"a_44\">Companies Act</a>, like computation of book profit, net\n        profit, etc. cannot be put into operation without the\n        Rules.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_41\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"432945\" id=\"span_10\">22.

Their Lordships have\n\nexpressed the view that without the rule, the provisions of the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1353758/\" id=\"a_45\">Companies Act</a> cannot be implemented because of the object behind\n\nthe various provisions of the Act and, hence, the framing of the rule\n\nwas imperative.      As has been indicated hereinabove, the factual\n\nmatrix of the present case is in a different spectrum.

Clause (3) of <a href=\"/doc/358020/\" id=\"a_60\">Article 166</a> empowers the\n           Governor to make rules for the more convenient\n           transaction of the business of the Government of\n           the State, and for the allocation among Minister of\n           the said business insofar as it is not business with\n           respect to which the Governor is by or under the\n           Constitution required to act in his discretion. The\n           memorandum was issued in the name of the\n           Governor. It is not in dispute that it was\n           authenticated in terms of clause (2) of <a href=\"/doc/358020/\" id=\"a_61\">Article 166</a>\n           of the Constitution. The power was exercised by\n           the State under the provisions of the Act. The said\n           order was to remain in force till rules are framed in\n           the prescribed manner.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">           23. The provisions of the Act mandate that the\n           unladen weight and laden weight must be\n           determined. Indisputably, weighing devices had to\n           be provided for the said purpose. It is true that for\n           the said purpose rules may have to be framed. It is,\n           however, a well-settled principle of law that even\n           in a case where the statute provides for certain\n           things to be done, subject to rules, any action taken\n           without framing the rules would not render any (sic\n           that) action invalid. If a statute is workable even\n           without framing of the rules, the same has to be\n           given effect to. The law itself except in certain\n           situations does not envisage vacuum.

From the aforesaid enunciation of law, it is clear as crystal\n\nthat if the provisions of the Act can be given effect to, non-framing\n\nof the rules would not vitiate the act. The acid test is the workability\n\nof the provisions. The submission of the learned counsel for the\n\nappellants is that without framing of the rules, a vote of no\n\nconfidence cannot be carried out. They have invited our attention to\n\n<a href=\"/doc/48504/\" id=\"a_62\">Sections 48</a> and <a href=\"/doc/795555/\" id=\"a_63\">51</a> of the Act. We have already reproduced <a href=\"/doc/795555/\" id=\"a_64\">Section\n\n51</a> of the Act hereinabove. <a href=\"/doc/48504/\" id=\"a_65\">Section 48</a> of the Act reads as under:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">            48. Meetings.- (1) The Municipality shall meet\n          not less than once in every month for the\n          transaction of its business.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_54\">          (2) The Chief Councillor may, whenever he thinks\n          fit, and shall, upon a requisition in writing by not\n          less than one-fifth of the Councillors, convene a\n          meeting of the Municipality.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_55\">         (3) If the Chief Councillor fails to call the\n         requisition meeting provided in sub-section (2), the\n         meeting may be called by the persons who signed\n         the requisition.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_56\">27.            On a scrutiny of the scheme of the Act, we are of the\n\nconsidered opinion that it cannot be said that without laying down of\n\nthe procedure for conduct of business in a special meeting under the\n\nrules, the provision as engrafted under <a href=\"/doc/501652/\" id=\"a_66\">Sections 25</a> and <a href=\"/doc/795555/\" id=\"a_67\">51</a> of the Act\n\ncannot really be effectively carried out. The procedure to be adopted\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_57\">                                  - 26 -\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_58\">\n\n\nhas to be fair. Appreciating the scheme of the Act in entirety, we\n\nnotice that the Chief Councillor has been empowered to convene a\n\nmeeting of the Municipality. In fact, <a href=\"/doc/48504/\" id=\"a_68\">Section 48</a> of the Act adequate\n\nguidance and safeguard. It is a well settled proposition of law that a\n\nstatute has to be read as a whole to understand its object and purpose.\n\nOn a reading of the provisions in entirety, we are of the considered\n\nview that a vote of no confidence can be mooted and carried out\n\nwithout framing of the rules and, hence, the provisions of the statute\n\nare workable.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_59\">28.          The next contention that is canvassed is that the learned\n\nsingle Judge has fallen into grave error by directing to convene\n\nanother meeting though a meeting had already been held on\n\n16.07.2009. It is worth noting that initially the meeting was fixed on\n\n16.07.2009 by the Chief Councillor himself. There was an\n\ninterdiction by the Additional Collector to postpone the meeting to\n\n17.07.2009. The said communication was dated 9th July, 2009. This\n\nCourt on 16.07.2009, while directing stay of the notice dated\n\n19.07.2009, had further directed status quo with regard to the\n\nholding of the meeting of no confidence on 16.07.2009. On that day,\n\nas is evident from the material on record, 12 Councillors attended the\n\nmeeting and it is not in dispute that the Madhubani Nagar Parishad\n\nconsists of 30 elected members. The learned single Judge opined\n\nand rightly so that when all the Councillors were not represented and\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_60\">                                 - 27 -\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_61\">\n\n\nthe Court had interdicted and the meeting was held on 16.07.2009,\n\nthere was really no notice to all concerned. If we permit ourselves to\n\nsay so, the writ court has applied the doctrine that `nobody should\n\nsuffer for the fault of the Court‟. Eighteen Councillors had filed a\n\nrequisition for convening a special meeting of the Nagar Parishad for\n\nconsidering the vote of no confidence. Sub-<a href=\"/doc/1410915/\" id=\"a_69\">section 25(4)</a> postulates\n\nthat a Chief Councillor or a Deputy Chief Councillor can be removed\n\nfrom the office by resolution carried by a majority of the whole\n\nnumber of Councillors holding the office. When the requisition was\n\nsent by 18 elected Councillors and a meeting is scheduled there has\n\nto be notice to all so that they can participate in the no confidence\n\nmotion. The meeting was conducted on 16.07.2009 because of an\n\ninterim order of this Court. The learned single Judge has held that\n\nthe said meeting was really no meeting in the eye of law. We think\n\nthe opinion expressed is correct inasmuch as in a democratic set up\n\nthere has to be a proper notice but in the instant case, there was a\n\nstate of confusion because of the interdiction by the Court at the\n\neleventh hour. The writ court thought it appropriate to rectify the\n\nerror and issue the direction. The same is in the fitness of things\n\nbecause it would be travesty of justice if the Councillors who had\n\nrequested for convening the meeting were not noticed when to\n\nappear in the meeting because nothing has been brought on record\n\nthat the Councillors were noticed again to attend the meeting on\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_62\">                                     - 28 -\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_63\">\n\n\n16.7.2009.     Thus, we do not find any error in the said direction of\n\nthe learned single Judge.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_64\">29.           Consequently, we perceive no merit in any of the appeals\n\nand, accordingly, all the appeals are dismissed without any order as\n\nto costs.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_65\">\n\n</p><pre id=\"pre_2\">            ( Dipak Misra, C.J. )            ( Mihir Kumar Jha, J. )\n\n\n\n\nPatna High Court.\nThe 15th April, 2010.\nAFR\nSunil.\n </pre>","numcites":38,"numcitedby":6,"docsource":"Patna High Court - Orders","citetid":78695684,"divtype":"judgments","relatedqs":[{"value":"executive instruction","formInput":"executive%20instruction"},{"value":"in the absence of rule","formInput":"in%20the%20absence%20of%20rule"},{"value":"air pollution","formInput":"air%20pollution"},{"value":"no confidence motion","formInput":"no%20confidence%20motion"},{"value":"removal of councillor","formInput":"removal%20of%20councillor"},{"value":"contemporanea","formInput":"contemporanea"},{"value":"\"accounting standards\"","formInput":"%22accounting%20standards%22"},{"value":"accounting standard","formInput":"accounting%20standard"},{"value":"pollution","formInput":"pollution"},{"value":"quorum ","formInput":"quorum%20"},{"value":"resignation","formInput":"resignation"},{"value":"casting vote","formInput":"casting%20vote"},{"value":"\"Air pollution\"","formInput":"%22Air%20pollution%22"},{"value":"lpa","formInput":"lpa"},{"value":"no further adjournment","formInput":"no%20further%20adjournment"},{"value":"SUNITA DEVI","formInput":"SUNITA%20DEVI"},{"value":"\"Vijay Kumar\"","formInput":"%22Vijay%20Kumar%22"},{"value":"sudha","formInput":"sudha"},{"value":"senior advocate","formInput":"senior%20advocate"},{"value":"PAWAN KUMAR","formInput":"PAWAN%20KUMAR"}],"cats":[{"value":"companies-law","formInput":"tag:companies-law"},{"value":"protection-of-life-and-liberty","formInput":"tag:protection-of-life-and-liberty"}],"courtcopy":true,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
