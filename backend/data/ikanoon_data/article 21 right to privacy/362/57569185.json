On 29th  August 2017 \n\n and   today,   we   have   heard   the   submissions   of   the   learned \n\n Counsel appearing for the parties.  \n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_2\"> 2.            The challenge in these two petitions is to the validity \n\n of   the   notification   dated   10th  August   2017.   By   the   said \n\n notification,   the   Noise   Pollution   (Regulation   and   Control) \n\n Amendment   Rules,   2017   (hereinafter   referred   to   as   the \n\n &quot;impugned Rules&quot;) were brought into force by which the Noise \n\n Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules 2000 (for short, &quot;the \n\n Principal Rules&quot;) have been amended.  Considering the various \n\n contentions raised across the bar, we find that many important \n\n questions   arise   which   are   required   to   be   finally   decided. \n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017                     ::: Downloaded on - 09/09/2017 01:33:20 :::</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_3\">                                        - 3 -        PIL No.24110/17@WP 9508/17\n\n\n Hence,   we   issue   Rule.   The   concerned   Respondents   waive \n\n service.  Issue notice to the learned Attorney General of India, \n\n returnable on 6th  October 2017, when these petitions will be \n\n fixed before this Bench for fixing a date for hearing.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_4\">      3. We have heard the learned Counsel representing the rival \n\n          parties at considerable length on the question of grant of \n\n          interim   reliefs.     Civil   Application   (Stamp)   No.2472   of \n\n          2015   has   been   taken   out   by   the   applicants   for \n\n          intervention   in   P.I.L   No.24110   of   2017.     The   learned \n\n          Counsel   appearing   for   the   applicants   submitted   that \n\n          instead of  filing a separate  petition for  challenging  the \n\n          impugned Rules, the applicants be ordered to be added \n\n          as respondents.  No party has  challenged the locus of the \n\n          applicants to make such an application.  Accordingly, we \n\n          allow the application in terms of prayer clause (a) and \n\n          direct   the   petitioners   in   P.I.L   to   carry   out   amendment \n\n          within a period of one week from the date on which this \n\n          order is uploaded.</p><pre id=\"pre_2\">\n\n                        OVERVIEW AND BACKGROUND\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017                       ::: Downloaded on - 09/09/2017 01:33:20 :::</span>\n                                             - 4 -      PIL No.24110/17@WP 9508/17\n\n\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_5\"> 4.            Before   making   a   brief   reference   to   the   submissions \n canvassed across the Bar, we must indicate the nature of the \n challenge.   The   Principal   Rules   were   brought   into   force   with \n effect   from   14th  February   2000.     For   framing   the   Principal \n Rules, a power has been exercised by the Central Government \n under Clause (ii) of Sub-Section (2) of Section 3, Sub-Section \n (1) and clause (b) of Sub-Section (2) of Section 6 and <a href=\"/doc/31045844/\" id=\"a_1\">Section \n 25</a> of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 (for short, &quot;1986 \n Act&quot;) read with Rule 5 of the Environment (Protection) Rules \n 1986 (in short, &quot;1986 Rules&quot;).

As educational\n               institutions, hospitals and courts have been defined in Rule 2, for\n               applicability of Sub-Rule (5) of Rule 3, it is not necessary to have\n               a specific declaration issued in respect of the silence zone around\n               hospitals, educational institutions and Courts.

On plain\n               reading of Sub-Rule (5) of Rule 3, a silence zone means an area of\n               100 meters on all sides of precincts of educational institutions,\n               hospitals, religious places and courts and not the area within the\n               precincts of the said institutions.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_48\">               (xiii)          In view of the clause (v) of Rule 6 of the Noise\n               Pollution Rules, using loud-speaker or public address system is an\n               offence and therefore, a permission under Sub-Rule (1) of Rule 5\n               to use loud-speaker or public address system in the open spaces in\n               silence zone cannot be granted.

So far as the first point is concerned, in our opinion, direction issued by\n      us on 25-9-2003 is clear. Prima facie, it appears to us that the provisions of\n      the Rules would apply to &#x27;an area comprising not less than hundred\n      metres around&#x27; hospitals, educational institutions, courts, religious\n      places or any other area which is declared as such by the competent\n      authority. In our view, this would be in consonance with the phraseology\n      used in clause (i) of Rule 6 which totally prohibits playing of &#x27;any music&#x27; or\n      using of &#x27;any sound amplifiers&#x27;. Had it been the intention of the rule-\n      making authority, it would not have used the expression &#x27;an area\n      comprising not less than 100 metres around&#x27; hospitals, educational\n      institutions, court, religious places, etc. Moreover, such interpretation\n      would also permit activities within those institutions in accordance\n      with law.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_43\">      8. At the same time, however, the apprehension voiced by the learned\n      counsel for the petitioners has also been taken care of. It cannot be\n      considered that with regard to such organisations, institutions, etc. there is\n      neither any standard nor limit whatsoever. In respect of such institutions\n      also, the general provisions <a href=\"/doc/41682933/\" id=\"a_9\">laid down in</a> Rule 5 which place restriction on the\n      use of loudspeaker/public address system would apply.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_55\">               <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1736771\" id=\"span_19\">In fact, the Apex Court in its decision in the case of \n <a href=\"/doc/1736771/\" id=\"a_10\">Farad   K.

Anyone who wishes to live in peace, comfort\n               and quiet within his house has a right to prevent noise as\n               pollutant reaching him. None can claim a right to create noise\n               even in his own premises which would travel beyond his precincts\n               and cause nuisance to neighbours or others. Any noise which has\n               the effect of materially interfering with the ordinary comforts of\n               life judged by the standard of a reasonable man is nuisance. How\n               and when a nuisance created by noise becomes actionable has to\n               be answered by reference to its degree and the surrounding\n               circumstances, the place and the time.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_46\">               11.

Nobody can claim a\n               fundamental right to create noise by amplifying the sound of his\n               speech with the help of loudspeakers. While one has a right to\n               speech, others have a right to listen or decline to listen.

Noise pollution was previously\n              confined to a few special areas like the factory or the mill, but\n              today it engulfs every nook and corner of the globe, reaching its\n              peak in urban areas.

From   the   side   of   petitioners   and   intervenors,   our \n attention   has  been invited to the  impugned Rules which  are \n promulgated in the form of impugned notification dated 10 th \n August   2017.     It   is   contended   that   on   the   plain   reading   of \n recitals of the impugned Rules, it is crystal clear that Central \n Government has purported to exercise the power under Rule 5 \n of   1986   Rules   which   is   a   power   to   impose   prohibition   or \n restrictions on the location of an industry or carrying on the \n processes and operations in an area.   It is submitted that the \n object   of   the   impugned   Rules   appears   to   be   to   impose   the \n restrictions and prohibition as contemplated by Sub-Rule 1 of \n Rule 5 of 1986 Rules. While doing so, major amendments have \n been made to Rule 3 of the Principal Rules and to the Schedule \n of   the   Principal   Rules.     The   submission   is   that   the   purpose \n sought to be achieved by the impugned Rules is very clear from \n the first five recitals. It is of imposing restrictions or prohibition \n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017                      ::: Downloaded on - 09/09/2017 01:33:21 :::</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_72\">                                       - 23 -        PIL No.24110/17@WP 9508/17\n\n\n as   contemplated   by   Rule   5   of   1986   Rules.     But   the \n amendments, which are made by the impugned Rules to the \n Principal   Rules,   have  no  nexus  with  the   object   sought   to  be \n achieved   under   Rule   5   of   the   1986   Rules.     Secondly,   it   is \n pointed  out   that  from   the   recitals,  it  is  apparent  that  power \n under Sub-Rule 1 of Rule 5 of 1986 Rules is exercised by taking \n recourse   to   the   Rule   making   power   under   1986   Act   and   in \n particular <a href=\"/doc/162712998/\" id=\"a_28\">Sections 3</a>, <a href=\"/doc/48644524/\" id=\"a_29\">6</a> and <a href=\"/doc/31045844/\" id=\"a_30\">25</a>.  The submission of the learned \n Counsel appearing for the petitioners is that though second last \n recital in the impugned Rules refers to Sub-Rule 4 of Rule 5 of \n 1986 Rules which confers a power on the Central Government \n to dispense with requirement of publishing a prior notice under \n Sub-Rule 3 of Rule 5 and inviting objections and suggestions, \n there   is   no   recital   that   any   such   power   of     dispensing   with \n requirement of Rule 3 has been exercised under the Sub-Rule 4 \n of Rule 5.  It is thus contended that the impugned Rules violate \n fundamental rights under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_31\">Article 21</a> and the <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_32\">Article 14</a> of the \n Constitution   of   India   as   the   same     suffer   from   arbitrariness. \n Our attention is also invited to the proviso added to Sub-Rule 5 \n of Rule 3.  The contention is that proviso refers to a notification \n issued in accordance with Sub-Rule 2 of Rule 3 though Sub- \n Rule   5   contemplates   a   declaration   of     silence   zone   for   the \n purpose of the Principal  Rules.  It is pointed out that Sub-Rule \n 2 of Rule 3, which is referred in proviso added to Sub-Rule 5 \n refers  to categorization  of an area into industrial, residential \n and silence zones.  It is contended that the proviso to Sub-Rule \n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017                       ::: Downloaded on - 09/09/2017 01:33:21 :::</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_73\">                                       - 24 -        PIL No.24110/17@WP 9508/17\n\n\n (5) which refers to Sub-Rule 2 of Rule 3 uses the word &#x27;notified&#x27; \n though Sub-Rule 2 of Rule 3 talks about categorization and not \n a notification.   The submission is that the conjoint reading of \n Sub-Rule 5 of Rule 3 along with the proviso would show that as \n area   falling   within   the   distance   of   100   meters   around   the \n hospitals,   educational   institutions   and   Courts   is   already \n declared as silence zone under the unamended Principal Rules, \n the  said areas  will continue to be  so even after coming  into \n force of the impugned Rules. The proviso added by way of the \n impugned   Rules   will   apply   only   if   some   other   area   is   to   be \n declared as a silence zone.  The contention is that as the object \n of  the   Principal   Rules and 1986 Act  is to save  citizens from \n noise pollution, such classification which is made does not have \n any intelligible differentia and does not establish any rational \n nexus   with   the   object   sought   to   be   achieved.     Therefore,   it \n violates <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_33\">Article 14</a> of Constitution of India.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_74\"> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"91938676\" id=\"span_31\">13.           It is urged that the impugned Rules also violate the \n fundamental rights guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_34\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution \n of India.   Our attention was invited to the decision of Larger \n Bench of the Apex Court consisting of 9 Hon&#x27;ble Judges in the \n case of Justice K.S. Puttaswamy (Retd.), and <a href=\"/doc/91938676/\" id=\"a_35\">Anr vs Union of India and\n Ors</a> . It is contended that the procedure established by law as \n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">      4</span>\n\n\n\n\n contemplated by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_36\">Article 21</a> has to be tested by referring <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_37\">Article \n 14</a>  of  the  Constitution of India.   It  is submitted that  even  if \n\n 4 2017 SCC OnLine SC 996</span>\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017                       ::: Downloaded on - 09/09/2017 01:33:21 :::</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_75\">                                      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"96824594\" id=\"span_34\">- 25 -       PIL No.24110/17@WP 9508/17\n\n\n restricted meaning is given to the procedure established by law, \n as  the  requirement of clause  (a)  of Sub-Rule  3 of Rule  5 of \n 1986 Rules of prior publication of Rules for inviting objections \n and suggestions from the citizens has not been followed, the \n procedure   established   by   law   has   not   been   followed.     It   is \n submitted that if interpretation of the State Government that \n no silence zone   is in existence after coming into force of the \n impugned Rules is accepted, it amounts to violation of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_38\">Article \n 21</a> of the Constitution of India.   One of the contentions raised \n by Mr. Anturkar without prejudice to   his contention that the \n impugned   Rules   are   unconstitutional,   is   that   in   view   of   the \n stand   taken   by   the   State  Government,   there   is   a   vacuum \n created in the sense that there is no silence zone in existence. \n His contention is that as held by the Apex Court in case of <a href=\"/doc/96824594/\" id=\"a_39\">Lalit \n Kumar Modi versus Board of Control</a> for Cricket in India and \n Others5, the Court always has a power to ensure that directions \n are issued so that the vacuum does not remain.</span>  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"42287\" id=\"span_35\">He also relied \n upon  a decision of this Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/42287/\" id=\"a_40\">Shaikh Yusuf Bhai \n Chawala and others vs. State of Maharashtra and others</a> 6.</span> \n <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"72156\" id=\"span_36\">He urged that power to fill in the gap or the vacuum has been \n exercised by this Court under <a href=\"/doc/56600062/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 151</a> of the Code of Civil \n Procedure 1908 in the case of <a href=\"/doc/72156/\" id=\"a_42\">Sangeeta Balkrishna Kadam v. \n Balkrishna Ramchandra Kadam7</a>.</span></p><pre id=\"pre_5\">\n\n\n\n 5 (2011)10 SCC 106\n 6 2011(6)Mh.L.J 691\n 7 AIR 1994 BOM 1\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017                     ::: Downloaded on - 09/09/2017 01:33:21 :::</span>\n                                      - 26 -       PIL No.24110/17@WP 9508/17\n\n\n</pre><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_76\"> 14.           The intervenors have also made detailed submissions. \n The main submission is that the impugned Rules do not affect \n the findings recorded in the decision of this Court in the case of \n Dr.   Mahesh   Bedekar   on   the   existence   of   silence   zones.   The \n impugned Rules do not affect the position of law which was on \n 10th  August 2017 and it does not affect what is held by this \n Court in Clause (xii) of  the judgment in the case of Dr. Mahesh \n Bedekar.   Without prejudice to the said contention, he urged \n that the impugned Rules are unconstitutional being contrary to \n the provisions of 1986 Act and 1986 Rules. He urged that it is a \n colourable exercise of powers.   Secondly, it is submitted that \n the impugned Rules are violative of fundamental rights of the \n citizens under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_43\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India.  He urged \n that   the   impugned   Rules   lead   to   manifest   absurdity,   absurd \n inconvenience and anomaly. He invited the   attention of the \n Court   to   the   fact   that   there   is   a   non-compliance   with   the \n requirements  of  clause  (a)   of  Sub-Rule  3 of  Rule   5 of  1986 \n Rules.     The   submission   is   that     the   requirement   of   prior \n publication under clause (a) of Sub-Rule 3 of Rule 5 of 1986 \n Rules has not been dispensed with and in any event it can be \n dispensed   with   only   when   it   appears   to   the   Central \n Government that it is necessary in public interest to do so.  The \n submission   is   that   instead   of   imposing   restrictions   and \n prohibition, by the impugned Rules, the prohibition is sought to \n be taken away and therefore, the proposed amendment is not \n at all in public interest.   The submission is that the exercise of \n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017                     ::: Downloaded on - 09/09/2017 01:33:21 :::</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_77\">                                          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1592182\" id=\"span_39\">- 27 -        PIL No.24110/17@WP 9508/17\n\n\n the Rule making power is  far from being in public interest. The \n action of doing away with silence zones is the violation of the \n rights under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_44\">Article 21.</a> The submission is that impugned Rules \n offend fundamental right to live peacefully and free from noise \n pollution.  The submission is that the amendment brought out \n is manifestly arbitrary and unreasonable.   Another submission \n of   the   intervenors   is   that   the   amendment   made   by   the \n impugned Rules will have to be read in such a manner which \n would advance the scheme and purpose of the Principal Rules \n and not to defeat the same and lead to absurdity.  Reliance was \n placed on the decision of the Apex Court in case of  Mandal \n Revenue   Office   Versus   Goundla   Venkaiah   and   Another 8  . \n Reliance is also placed on another decision of the Apex Court in \n case of <a href=\"/doc/1592182/\" id=\"a_45\">H.S.

We have considered the respective arguments and\n               submissions and carefully perused the record. Since the matter is\n               pending adjudication before the High Court, we do not want to\n               express any opinion on the merits and demerits of the writ petitioner&#x27;s\n               challenge to the constitutional validity of the 2003 Act and the 2004\n               Rules as amended in 2005 but have no hesitation in holding that the\n               High Court was not at all justified in passing the impugned orders\n               ignoring the well-settled proposition of law that in matters involving\n               challenge to the constitutionality of any legislation enacted by the\n               legislature and the rules framed thereunder the courts should be\n               extremely loath to pass an interim order. At the time of final\n               adjudication, the court can strike down the statute if it is found to be\n               ultra vires the Constitution. Likewise, the rules can be quashed if\n               the same are found to be unconstitutional or ultra vires the\n               provisions of the Act. However, the operation of the statutory\n               provisions cannot be stultified by granting an interim order\n               except when the court is fully convinced that the particular\n               enactment or the rules are ex facie unconstitutional and the\n               factors, like balance of convenience, irreparable injury and public\n               interest are in favour of passing an interim order.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_89\">               14.             <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"907493\" id=\"span_52\">In <a href=\"/doc/907493/\" id=\"a_60\">Bhavesh D.

Before we conclude there is another matter which we\n               must advert to. It has been brought to our notice that <a href=\"/doc/182701402/\" id=\"a_62\">Section 45-S</a> of\n               the Act has been challenged in various High Courts and a few of them\n               have granted the stay of provisions of Section 45-S. When\n               considering an application for staying the operation of a piece of\n               legislation, and that too pertaining to economic reform or change,\n               then the courts must bear in mind that unless the provision is\n               manifestly unjust or glaringly unconstitutional, the courts must\n               show judicial restraint in staying the applicability of the same.\n               Merely because a statute comes up for examination and some\n               arguable point is raised, which persuades the courts to consider the\n               controversy, the legislative will should not normally be put under\n               suspension pending such consideration. It is now well settled that\n               there is always a presumption in favour of the constitutional validity\n               of any legislation, unless the same is set aside after final hearing and,\n               therefore, the tendency to grant stay of legislation relating to\n               economic reform, at the interim stage, cannot be understood. The\n               system of checks and balances has to be utilised in a balanced manner\n               with the primary objective of accelerating economic growth rather\n               than suspending its growth by doubting its constitutional efficacy at\n               the threshold itself.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_91\">               31.             While the courts should not abrogate (sic abdicate)\n               their duty of granting interim injunctions where necessary,\n               equally important is the need to ensure that the judicial discretion\n               does    not     abrogate   from   the   function    of   weighing     the\n               overwhelming public interest in favour of the continuing\n               operation of a fiscal statute or a piece of economic reform\n               legislation, till on a mature consideration at the final hearing, it is\n               found to be unconstitutional. It is, therefore, necessary to sound a\n               word of caution against intervening at the interlocutory stage in\n               matters of economic reforms and fiscal statutes.&quot;</p><pre id=\"pre_6\">\n\n                                                                  (emphasis added)\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_54\">::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017                               ::: Downloaded on - 09/09/2017 01:33:21 :::</span>\n                                             - 36 -            PIL No.24110/17@WP 9508/17\n\n\n 20.

The court considering the validity of a subordinate\n            legislation, will have to consider the nature, object and scheme of the\n            enabling Act, and also the area over which power has been delegated\n            under the Act and then decide whether the subordinate legislation\n            conforms to the parent statute. Where a rule is directly inconsistent with a\n            mandatory provision of the statute, then, of course, the task of the court is\n            simple and easy. But where the contention is that the inconsistency or\n            non-conformity of the rule is not with reference to any specific provision\n            of the enabling Act, but with the object and scheme of the parent Act, the\n            court should proceed with caution before declaring invalidity.&quot;\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_97\"> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"223504\" id=\"span_56\">22.

The \n third   recital   refers   to   grant   of   an   opportunity   of  filing   of \n objections on the basis of the notice within the time specified \n therein.  The fourth recital refers to clause (d) of the Sub-Rule \n 3 of Rule 5 which provides that the Central Government shall \n within a period of 120 days from the date of publication of the \n notification in the official gazette, consider all such objections \n received against the Notification and within 545 days specified \n from such publication, impose such prohibitions or restrictions \n on   location   of   industries   and   carrying   on   any   process   or \n operations in any area.  What is material is  fifth recital which \n shows that the Central Government intended to rely upon Sub-\n Rule   (4)   of   Rule   5   of   the   1986   Rules.     It   provides   that, \n whenever   it   appears  to   the  Central  Government   that  it  is  in \n public interest to do so, it may dispense with the requirement \n of publication of a notice under clause (a) of sub-rule (3) of \n rule 5 of 1986 Rules.

It is provided in clause (a) of the Sub-Rule \n (3) of Rule 5 of 1986 Rules that   whenever it appears to the \n Central Government that it is expedient to impose prohibition \n or restrictions on the locations of an industry or the carrying on \n of processes and operations in an area, it may by a notification \n in the Official Gazette and in such other manner as the Central \n government may deem necessary from time to time, give notice \n of   its   intention   to   do   so.     Contents   of   the   notice   have   been \n specified   in   clause   (b)   of   Sub-rule   (3).     Clause   (c)   thereof \n contains   the   requirement   of   calling   for   filing   of   objections \n against   the   proposed   imposition   and   prohibition   and \n restrictions   within  a  period  of  60  days  from  the   date  of  the \n publication   in   the   official   gazette.     Clause   (d)   mandates   the \n Central   Government   to   consider   all   the   objections   within   a \n period of 120 days and it confers the power to impose such \n prohibition or restrictions within specified 365 days from the \n date of the publication of the notification in official Gazzette. \n In the present case,  it is explicitly clear that by the impugned \n Rules, the Central Government purported to exercise the power \n of imposing prohibition  or restrictions under Rule 5 of 1986 \n Rules by taking recourse to the Rule making power under 1985 \n Act.   The   decision   of   the   Apex   Court   in   the   case   of \n <a href=\"/doc/1316639/\" id=\"a_69\">Peerless</a>(supra)   will   have   no   application   to   this   case   as   the \n Apex Court was not dealing with the rule making power.</span> \n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_65\">::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017                         ::: Downloaded on - 09/09/2017 01:33:21 :::</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_111\">                                        - 44 -       PIL No.24110/17@WP 9508/17\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_112\"> 28.           The provisions of clauses (a), (b) and (c) of Sub-rule \n (3)  of   Rule   5   of 1986 Rules  are  mandatory  in  nature, in  as \n much   as,   whenever   it   is   intended   to   impose   prohibition   or \n restrictions as contemplated by Rule 5, the Central Government \n is under a mandate   to notify its intention to do so in official \n gazette and in such other manner as it may deem fit.   Only \n when the Central Government is satisfied that it is in public \n interest to do so, it may dispense with the requirement of prior \n publication of notice under clause (a) of Sub-Rule 3.  As noted \n earlier,     the   learned   Additional   Solicitor   General   of   India \n candidly   stated   that   in   this   case,   there   is   no   specific   order \n passed by any authority of the Central Government dispensing \n with the requirement of notice by exercising power under  Sub-\n rule 4 of Rule 5 of 1986 Rules.  He tendered on record a copy \n of   the   communication   dated   1st  September   2017   (L-1   for \n identification) issued by the Joint Director in the Ministry of \n Environment,   Forest   and   Climate   Change,   Government   of \n India.  The contents of the letter show that there is no specific \n decision taken by the Central Government to the effect that it is \n in public interest to dispense with the requirement of a notice \n under clause (a) of Sub-Rule (3).  In fact, the admitted position \n which is revealed from the statement of the learned Additional \n Solicitor   General   of   India   is   that   there   is   no   specific   order \n passed by any competent authority recording its satisfaction  in \n terms sub-rule (4) of Rule 5 of 1986 Rules.  Thus, there was a \n mandatory   requirement   of   prior   publication   permitting   the \n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_66\">::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017                       ::: Downloaded on - 09/09/2017 01:33:21 :::</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_113\">                                         - 45 -        PIL No.24110/17@WP 9508/17\n\n\n members of  the  public  to submit  objections and suggestions, \n but the same has not been complied with in this case.   Thus, \n the exercise is ex-facie illegal being contrary to Sub-Rule (3) of \n Rule 5 of the 1986 Rules. \n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_114\"> 29.       We may note here that if the interpretation put by the \n State   Government   as   well   as   Central   Government   to   the \n impugned Rules is correct, the effect of the amendment will be \n that   as   of   today,   no   silence   zone   exists   in   the   State   of \n Maharashtra   as   the   State   Government   has   not   declared   any \n area as a silence zone acting upon the impugned Rules. Thus, \n the     use   of   loud-speakers   and   other   prohibited   activities   as \n specified   in   Rule   6   of   the   Principal   Rules   can   be   permitted \n within   a  distance  of 100 meters from  Courts,  Hospitals,  and \n schools/colleges. If such permissions are granted, the same will \n violate fundamental rights under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_70\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution \n of India as spelt out in the decision of the Apex Court in case of \n Noise Pollution (V), IN RE ( supra). Thus, even assuming that \n there was an exercise of powers under Sub-Rule (4) of Rule 5 \n of 1986  of  dispensing with prior  publication  under Sub-Rule \n (3)   thereof,   the   said   exercise   of   powers   is   ex-facie   against \n Public   interest   especially   when   the   case   of   both   the \n Governments is that the silence zones under the unamended \n Principal Rules in terms of the decision of this Court in the case \n of Dr. Mahesh Bedekar now no longer exist.  In view of the fact \n that   the   right   to   lead   a  noise  pollution   free  life   is  a  part  of \n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_67\">::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017                         ::: Downloaded on - 09/09/2017 01:33:21 :::</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_115\">                                       - 46 -       PIL No.24110/17@WP 9508/17\n\n\n <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_71\">Article   21</a>,   the   impugned   Rules   which   purport   to   abolish   all \n existing silence zones cannot be said to have been framed in \n public interest. Surely, dispensing with the requirement of prior \n publication is not at all in public interest.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_116\">      30. We   may   note  one  more  factual  aspect  here.   As  noted \n\n          earlier, even the Principal Rules show that the same were \n          enacted under Clause (ii) of Sub-<a href=\"/doc/89100821/\" id=\"a_72\">Section 2</a> of <a href=\"/doc/162712998/\" id=\"a_73\">Section 3</a>, \n          Sub-<a href=\"/doc/122461477/\" id=\"a_74\">Section 1</a> and Clause (b) of Sub-<a href=\"/doc/89100821/\" id=\"a_75\">Section 2</a> of <a href=\"/doc/48644524/\" id=\"a_76\">Section \n          6</a> and <a href=\"/doc/31045844/\" id=\"a_77\">Section 25</a> of the 1986 Act  read with Rule 5 of \n          1986   Rules.   Since   Rule   5   of   1986   Rules   was   invoked, \n          prior publication of the Principal Rules was made by the \n          Central Government in accordance with clause (a) of sub-\n          Rule (3) of Rule 5 of 1986 Rules.  In fact, whenever the \n          Principal Rules were modified, such prior publication was \n          made by the Central Government. In fact, while making \n          all the subsequent amendments thereto, apart from other \n          provisions,   even   Rule   5   of   1986   Rules   was   invoked. \n          Perhaps in case of only one amendment made in the year \n          2000, the requirement of prior publication was dispensed \n          with.     We   may   note   here   that   learned   Government \n          Pleader placed on record the notification dated 10th June \n          2006 amending the notification dated 19 th February 1991 \n          regarding Coastal Zone Regulations. As the modification \n          was   done   by   invoking   Rule   5   of   1986   Rules,     the \n          notification dated 10th  June 2006 shows that the power \n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_68\">::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017                      ::: Downloaded on - 09/09/2017 01:33:21 :::</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_117\">                                         - 47 -        PIL No.24110/17@WP 9508/17\n\n\n          under Sub-Rule (4) of Rule 5 was specifically invoked as \n          there is a recital in  that the Central Government is of the \n          opinion that it is in public interest to dispense with the \n          said requirement of notice under clause (a) of Sub-Rule \n          (3) of rule 5 of the 1986 Rules.  As stated earlier, in the \n          impugned   Rules,   there   is   no   recital   that   the   Central \n          Government   is   of   the   opinion   that   it   is   in   the   public \n          interest to dispense with the requirement of notice under \n          Sub-Rule   (3)   of   Rule   5   of   the   1986   Rules.     The    fifth \n          recital in the impugned Rules merely refers to the power \n          which is conferred under Sub-Rule (4) of Rule 5 of 1986 \n          Rules without recording that the said power was in fact \n          exercised.   Had   the   prior   publication   been   made,   the \n          citizens   could   have   pointed   out   the   ill   effects   of   the \n          proposed amendments and the fact that the same violate \n          their fundamental rights under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_78\">Article 21.</a> In fact in the \n          light of the rights guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_79\">Article 21</a>, no one is \n          entitled to use loud-speaker as a matter of right. From \n          the   submissions   made   across   the   Bar   on   behalf   of   the \n          State Government it appears to us that the State is under \n          a misconception that in certain cases, by not allowing the \n          use of loud-speakers within a distance of 100 meters from \n          a Hospital, School/college or Court, as the case may be, \n          rights of handful of citizens will be affected.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_118\"> 31            There   is   another   important   aspect   of   the   matter. \n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_69\">::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017                         ::: Downloaded on - 09/09/2017 01:33:21 :::</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_119\">                                                - 48 -         PIL No.24110/17@WP 9508/17\n\n\n Recitals   in   the   impugned   Rules   show   that   the   power   of \n imposing   restrictions   and   prohibition   under   Sub-Rule   (1)   of \n Rule 5 was sought to be invoked by taking recourse to the rule \n making powers under 1986 Act.  Thus, the object of impugned \n Rules seems to be to impose restrictions as contemplated under \n Sub-Rule   (1)   of   Rule   5   of   1986   Rules.     We   have   noted   the \n contents of the impugned Rules which do not impose any such \n restrictions or prohibition contemplated by Sub-Rule 1 of Rule \n 5   of   1986   Rules   and   on   the   contrary,   the   impugned   Rules \n purport   to   amend     the   provisions   in   the   Principal   Rules \n regarding   the   silence   zones.   The   impugned   Rules   intend   to \n remove the prohibition or relax the same which existed in the \n Principal   Rules.       Thus,   there   is   no   nexus   between   the \n impugned Rules and the object   sought to be achieved under \n Rule 5 of 1986 Rules.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_120\"> 32.

When the validity of a law is questioned\n               on the ground that it violates a guarantee contained in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_82\">Article 21</a>,\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_70\">::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017                                 ::: Downloaded on - 09/09/2017 01:33:21 :::</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_96\">                                             - 49 -          PIL No.24110/17@WP 9508/17\n\n               the scope of the challenge is not confined only to whether the\n               procedure for the deprivation of life or personal liberty is fair,\n               just and reasonable. Substantive challenges to the validity of laws\n               encroaching upon the right to life or personal liberty has been\n               considered and dealt with in varying contexts, such as the death\n               penalty (Bachan Singh) and mandatory death sentence (Mithu),\n               among other cases. A person cannot be deprived of life or personal\n               liberty except in accordance with the procedure established by law.\n               <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_83\">Article 14</a>, as a guarantee against arbitrariness, infuses the entirety of\n               <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_84\">Article 21.</a> The inter-relationship between the guarantee against\n               arbitrariness and the protection of life and personal liberty\n               operates in a multi-faceted plane. First, it ensures that the\n               procedure for deprivation must be fair, just and reasonable.\n               Second, <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_85\">Article 14</a> impacts both the procedure and the expression\n               &quot;law&quot;. A law within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_86\">Article 21</a> must be consistent\n               with the norms of fairness which originate in <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_87\">Article 14.</a> As a\n               matter of principle, once <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_88\">Article 14</a> has a connect with <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_89\">Article 21</a>,\n               norms of fairness and reasonableness would apply not only to the\n               procedure but to the law as well.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_121\">                                                       (emphasis added)\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_122\"> 33.           We   have already  spelt out  what  is the fundamental \n right of citizens under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_90\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India, in \n relation to noise.  The impugned Rules purport to withdraw or \n cancel   the   existing   silence   zones.   Therefore,   the   prohibition \n imposed   by   Rule   6  on   use   of   loud-speakers   in   silence   zones \n existing on 10th August 2017 may not apply if the stand of the \n State   is   correct.   Hence,   the   rights   under   <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_91\">Article   21</a>   will   be \n infringed.  The procedure followed for purportedly obliterating \n the   existing   silence   zones   without   inviting   objections   and \n suggestions is thus manifestly arbitrary and violative of Article \n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_71\">::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017                               ::: Downloaded on - 09/09/2017 01:33:21 :::</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_123\">                                     - 50 -       PIL No.24110/17@WP 9508/17\n\n\n 14 of the Constitution of India.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_124\"> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1736771\" id=\"span_72\">34.           We have made a reference to the decision of the Apex \n Court in case of  <a href=\"/doc/1736771/\" id=\"a_92\">Farhd K. Wadia v. Union of India</a> which is \n extensively   considered   by   the   Division   Bench   of   this   Court \n while deciding the case of Dr. Bedekar.</span>  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"41682933\" id=\"span_73\">We have also referred \n to an interim order of 25th September 2003 which operated till \n 16th  August   2016   when   <a href=\"/doc/41682933/\" id=\"a_93\">Dr.   Bedekar</a>&#x27;s   case   was   decided. \n Thereafter, what is held in clause (xii) of paragraph 93 of the \n said Judgment is operative. Thus, the silence zones which were \n in existence at least for 14 years are sought to be taken away \n by the impugned Rules in a manifestly arbitrary manner.   We \n may note here that clause (xii) of paragraph 93 of   <a href=\"/doc/41682933/\" id=\"a_94\">the said \n judgment</a> which is upheld by the Apex  Court holds that silence \n zone comprises of an area within the distance of 100 meters \n around the hospitals, educational institutions and Courts and it \n is  not   necessary   for   the  State  to  declare  any  such   area  as  a \n silence zone.  Thus, from the year 2003, the view taken by the \n Court is that the area falling within the distance of 100 meters \n around the hospitals, educational institutions and Courts will \n be considered as a silence zone though it was not specifically \n declared to be so by the State Government.</span>  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"41682933\" id=\"span_74\">In fact, on the very \n issue,   a   Special   Leave   Petition   was   preferred   by   the   State \n Government   for   challenging   what   is   held   in   clause   (xii)   of \n paragraph 93 of the  Judgment in <a href=\"/doc/41682933/\" id=\"a_95\">Dr.Bedekar</a> case which was \n summarily dismissed.</span>  At this stage, we are not recording any \n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_75\">::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017                    ::: Downloaded on - 09/09/2017 01:33:21 :::</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_125\">                                        - 51 -       PIL No.24110/17@WP 9508/17\n\n\n final opinion on the question whether the directions in clause \n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_126\"> (xii) of paragraph 93 of the said Judgment as regards silence \n zones   continue   to   operate   notwithstanding   the   impugned \n Rules. But, suffice it to say that for considerably long time (at \n least   from   25th            September   2003),   the   judicial \n decisions/direction holding that the silence zone comprises of \n an area within the distance of 100 meters around the hospitals, \n educational institutions and Courts  operated with full force till \n 10th August 2017.  Now, the contention of State of Maharashtra \n as   well   as   Central   Government   is   that   no   silence   zone   is   in \n existence from the date of the impugned Rules.   If that is the \n interpretation   put   by   the   State   Government   to   the   amended \n Rules, ex-facie, the amended Rules will violate the fundamental \n rights  of  the   citizens under  <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_96\">Article  21</a> of  the  Constitution  of \n India.  As observed and held  earlier, the impugned Rules will \n not stand the test of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_97\">Article 14</a>   for two reasons.   The first is \n that there is no nexus between the impugned Rules and object \n sought   to   be   achieved   by   the   impugned   Rules   framed   in \n exercise of powers under Rule 5 of 1986 Rules.  Secondly, the \n exercise of power is manifestly unreasonable and arbitrary as \n there is no prior publication made as required by clause (a) of \n Sub-Rule 3 of Rule 5 of 1986 Rules.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_127\"> 35.           If the   interpretation put by the Central Government \n as well as state Government is taken into consideration, it is \n now possible  to  grant a permission to use a loud-speaker or \n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_76\">::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017                       ::: Downloaded on - 09/09/2017 01:33:21 :::</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_128\">                                         <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"41682933\" id=\"span_77\">- 52 -        PIL No.24110/17@WP 9508/17\n\n\n sound     amplifier   even   at   a  distance   of   5  to   10  meters   from \n hospitals,   Courts,   or   schools/colleges.   The   refusal   to   grant \n permission to use a loud-speaker for preventing noise pollution \n does   not   offend     fundamental   rights   of   any   individual. \n Moreover, the restrictions imposed by Rule 6 of the Principal \n Rules do not apply within the precincts of Courts, Hospitals, \n schools etc as held in <a href=\"/doc/41682933/\" id=\"a_98\">Dr. Bedekar</a>&#x27;s case. Thus, a loud-speaker \n can be used in a function held in open courtyard of this Court \n or   on   a   ground   situated   within   the   precincts   of   a \n school/college. Moreover, it has been held that restrictions do \n not apply to enclosed premises in silence zones in which loud-\n speakers can be used after obtaining permission.</span> \n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_129\"> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"41682933\" id=\"span_78\">36.           Therefore, we are of the considered view that there is \n a very strong prima facie case to hold that the impugned rules \n are   unconstitutional.   In   fact   the   Rules   are   ex-facie \n unconstitutional.   As we have   held that the impugned Rules \n will violate fundamental rights guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_99\">Article 21</a> of \n the Constitution of India,   this is a case where there will be \n irreparable injury to the citizens especially in the light of the \n law <a href=\"/doc/41682933/\" id=\"a_100\">laid down by</a> the Apex Court that a right to live in noise \n pollution free atmosphere is guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_101\">Article 21</a> of the \n Constitution. Noise is a major health hazard on various aspects \n set   out   in   its   decision.     It   follows   that   even   the   factors   of \n balance   of   convenience   and     public   interest   are   strongly   in \n favour of passing an interim order.</span> No one can claim that his \n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_79\">::: Uploaded on - 08/09/2017                         ::: Downloaded on - 09/09/2017 01:33:21 :::</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_130\">                                           - 53 -        PIL No.24110/17@WP 9508/17\n\n\n rights are affected in any manner if he is denied a permission \n to   use   loud-speaker   within   a   close   distance   from \n Hospitals/clinics,   schools/colleges   or   Courts.   It   in   public \n interest   that   such   permissions   should   not   be   granted.   By \n denying such permission, rights under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_102\">Article 19</a> or 25 are not \n at all infringed. Use of loud-speakers for celebrating a religious \n festival is not an essential part of any religion.  \n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_131\"> 37            Even   if   an   interim   order   is   passed,   the   position \n regarding silence zones which existed if not from the date on \n which   Principal   Rules   came   into   force,   but   at   least   from \n September 2003, will continue to exist.
