He has not asked for details of anything which could be termed as Judicial proceedings or part of the Judicial process. During the enquiry it was also confirmed by the Assistant Public Information Officer that these details are received and collected by the Registry of the High Court routinely. <a href=\"/doc/13503/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 4</a> of the RTI Act very clearly defines the obligation of the public authorities. Most of the information sought for by the present appellant seem to be covered in this section. Such being the case the Hon&#x27;ble High Court,Madras, being a public authority, requires to provide access to these information unless expressly prohibited by a Competent forum or exempted as defined under various sections of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_3\">RTI Act</a>. It is also observed that the appellant has asked only for statistical details and not names of individuals. Therefore, the argument of &quot;un warranted invasion of privacy of individuals&quot; is very weak and hence not accepted&#x27; and resultantly, allowed the appeal by directing the public authority (Writ Petitioner) to furnish the details within 15 days from the date of receipt of this order.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">\t3.According to the Learned Counsel for the Petitioner/Registrar General, High Court of Madras, the impugned order dated 10.01.2012 in Case No.10447/Enquiry/A/11 passed by the Tamil Nadu Information Commission, Chennai is legally void and therefore, it is liable to be set aside.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_5\">\t4.The Learned Counsel for the Petitioner urges before this Court that the impugned order has been passed in violation of the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_4\">Right to Information Act, 2005</a> and as such, it is void ab initio. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_6\">\t5.The Learned Counsel for the Petitioner contends that the Tamil Nadu Information Commission, Chennai, while passing the impugned order dated 10.01.2012, has failed to appreciate an important fact that the information sought for by the 1st Respondent/Petitioner is infringing the internal administration of Hon&#x27;ble High Court of Madras.\n</p>\t\t\t\t\t\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_7\">\t6.Yet another submission of the Learned Counsel for the Petitioner is that if the request of the 1st Respondent/Petitioner is acceded to by the High Court of Madras, then, it will set a bad precedent for others. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_8\">\t7.Per contra, the 1st Respondent/Petitioner submits that he has enrolled as an Advocate in the Bar Council of Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry in the year 1986 and is practising before the High Court of Madras and before the trial Courts in Chennai. Also that, he is engaged in various social activities. Furthermore, he was appointed as an Assistant Solicitor General of India in the High Court  of Madras during the period 2008-2009. He served as Special Government Pleader for the Tamil Nadu State during the year 2006 - 2008.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">\t8.According to the 1st Respondent/Petitioner that he is the legal advisor of several Residents&#x27; Welfare Associations and Traders&#x27; Welfare Associations at K.K. Nagar, Chennai \u0016 600 078. He served as President of Rotary Club of Madras, T.Nagar (2005-2006) and General Secretary of Anti Bribe Coalition, (a public trust) a wing of EXNORA international and an active member of India Against Corruption.\n</p>\t\t\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_10\">\t9.The 1st Respondent/Petitioner contends that he approached the Public Information Officer of the High Court, Madras to find out the mechanism and structure the High Court has to take action against the corrupt employees and the Presiding Officers of the Subordinate Judiciary and sought certain information, by means of queries, as referred in para 3 of the Affidavit filed by the Writ Petitioner. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\">\t10.According to the 1st Respondent/Petitioner, the information sought for by him are all matters defined under <a href=\"/doc/1516599/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 2(f)</a> of the Right to Information Act, 2005. As a matter of fact, those information do not come within <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 8</a> of the Right to Information Act, 2005. \n</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_12\">\t11.The 1st Respondent/Petitioner lodged an Appeal dated 20.12.2010 before the Appellate Authority (Writ Petitioner). But the Appellate Authority had not furnished information sought for by him vide his letter dated 01.11.2010. As such, he was perforced to prefer Second Appeal to the Information Commissioner on 18.03.2011.   The 2nd Respondent/Tamil Nadu Information Commission, through its direction dated 23.03.2011, has transmitted the petition dated 16.03.2011 of the 1st Respondent for taking appropriate action. Also, the 2nd Respondent/Information Commission has sought the remarks of the Writ Petitioner/Registrar General by 27.04.2011 for the said petition. The Registrar (Administration)/Public Information Officer of the Petitioner/High Court sent a reply dated 27.04.2011 to the Registrar of the 2nd Respondent/Information Commission stating that the remarks called for in the matter would be furnished shortly.  However, the Writ Petitioner (Appellate Authority), on 29.04.2011, sent a letter to the Information Commission (marking a copy to him) denying the information. However, the Tamil Nadu Information Commission, Chennai passed an order on 10.01.2012 directing the Petitioner/Appellant to furnish the informations to the 1st Respondent/ Petitioner.\n</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_13\">\t12.The Learned Senior Counsel appearing for the 2nd Respondent/Tamil Nadu Information Commission submits that the 1st Respondent/Petitioner, as a citizen, has a statutory right, to obtain the informations sought for by him, through his Letter dated 01.11.2010 addressed to the Public Information Officer of the Writ Petitioner/High Court. Further, <a href=\"/doc/13503/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 4</a> of the Act speaks of &#x27;Obligations of the Public Authority&#x27;. As such, the informations sought for by the 1st Respondent/ Applicant through his Letter dated 01.11.2010 do squarely come within the purview of <a href=\"/doc/13503/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 4</a> of the Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_14\">\t13.The Learned Senior Counsel for the 2nd Respondent urges before this Court that <a href=\"/doc/1971086/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 22</a> of the Right to Information Act enjoins that the provisions of the Act have an overriding effect on the <a href=\"/doc/61492784/\" id=\"a_10\">Official Secrets Act, 1923</a> (19 of 1923) and any other law for the time being in force etc. Viewed in that perspective, it is contended that the informations sought for by the 1st Respondent/Petitioner, by his Letter dated 01.11.2010, can be supplied by the Petitioner/High Court, because of the reason that he has sought for statistical particulars and names of individuals concerned. In short, the Learned Senior Counsel for the 2nd Respondent contends that the impugned order dated 10.01.2012 passed by the Tamil Nadu Information Commission does not suffer from any impropriety or illegality, in the eye of law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_15\">\t14.The Learned Counsel for the Petitioner submits that the information sought for by the 1st Respondent/Petitioner in his application dated 01.11.2010 addressed to Public Information Officer of High Court relates to the internal administration of the Madras High Court and the information sought for by the 1st Respondent/Petitioner from Serial Nos.1 to 9 in his application dated 01.11.2010, if furnished would cause an invasion of privacy of the individuals. Therefore, under the ingredients of <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 8(e)</a> and (f) of the Act, the Writ Petitioner is exempted to disclose the information sought for. Also, as per <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 8(i)</a> of the Act, the Petitioner/High Court is exempted to disclose the information sought for by the 1st Respondent/Petitioner.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"160205361\" id=\"span_1\">15.To lend support to the contention that the information sought for by the 1st Respondent/Petitioner, in his application dated 01.11.2010 addressed to the Public Information Officer of High Court, Madras, cannot be acceded to by the Petitioner, the Learned Counsel for the Petitioner cites the order of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in Special Leave Petition (Civil) No.27734 of 2012 (@ CC 14781/2012) dated 03.10.2012 between <a href=\"/doc/160205361/\" id=\"a_13\">Girish Ramchandra Deshpande V. Cen</a>. Information Commissioner &amp; Others, wherein in paragraphs 12 to 16, it is observed and laid down as follows:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">&quot;12. The petitioner herein sought for copies of all memos, show cause notices and censure/punishment awarded to the third respondent from his employer and also details viz. movable and immovable properties and also the details of his investments, lending and borrowing from Banks and other financial institutions. Further, he has also sought for the details of gifts stated to have accepted by the third respondent, his family members and friends and relatives at the marriage of his son. The information mostly sought for finds a place in the income tax returns of the third respondent. The question that has come up for consideration is whether the above-mentioned information sought for qualifies to be \u0013personal information\u0014 as defined in clause (j) of <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 8(1)</a> of the RTI Act.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">13. We are in agreement with the CIC and the courts below that the details called for by the petitioner i.e. copies of all memos issued to the third respondent, show cause notices and orders of censure /punishment etc. are qualified to be personal information as defined in clause (j) of <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 8(1)</a> of the RTI Act. The performance of an employee/officer in an organization is primarily a matter between the employee and the employer and normally those aspects are governed by the service rules which fall under the expression \u0013personal information\u0014, the disclosure of which has no relationship to any public activity or public interest. On the other hand, the disclosure of which would cause unwarranted invasion of privacy of that individual. Of course, in a given case, if the Central Public Information Officer or the State Public Information Officer of the Appellate Authority is satisfied that the larger public interest justifies the disclosure of such information, appropriate orders could be passed but the petitioner cannot claim those details as a matter of right.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">14. The details disclosed by a person in his income tax returns are \u0013personal information\u0014 which stand exempted from disclosure under clause (j) of <a href=\"/doc/1001313/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 8(1)</a> of the RTI Act, unless involves a larger public interest and the Central Public Information Officer or the State Public Information Officer or the Appellate Authority is satisfied that the larger public interest justifies the disclosure of such information.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">15. The petitioner in the instant case has not made a bona fide public interest in seeking information, the disclosure of such information would cause unwarranted invasion of privacy of the individual under <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the RTI Act.\t\t\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">16. We are, therefore, of the view that the petitioner has not succeeded in establishing that the information sought for is for the larger public interest. That being the fact, we are not inclined to entertain this special leave petition. Hence, the same is dismissed.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">\t16.The Learned Counsel for the Petitioner also seeks in aid of the order of this Court dated 12.02.2010 in W.P.Nos.8068 and 8069 of 2008 between M.Velayutham V. The Registrar, Tamil Nadu Information Commission, Teynampet, Chennai- 18 &amp; 3 others, wherein in paragraphs 10 and 11, it is observed and held as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">&quot;10.Before closing the case it must be noted that whenever a person challenges the order of the State or Central Information Commission, it is not necessary to make the Commission a party to the writ petition. The Commission is a statutory appellate authority and is expected to function within the four corners of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_18\">RTI Act</a>. If its orders are under challenge, the Commission is not expected to defend it. In a writ for certiorari the order will have to speak for itself. If the Commission is made as a party, it will be an unnecessary drain on the Commission to engage counsel to defend its orders. In no case a court is expected to defend its decisions. More often, the Commission&#x27;s orders are challenged by the Government departments or information officers at the expense of the Government. In these cases, the applicant who sought the information will be a party and will be expected to defend his request. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">11.Only for the purpose of calling for records or sending a copy of the order, the Information Commission need not be made as a party. If the persons who do not file proper records, then a notice may be sent by the Registry to call for the records if ordered by the courts. Likewise, on complicated matters if any legal assistance is required, the Court can appoint an &#x27;amicus curiae&#x27; to help the Court. The orders of the Court on all matters involving the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_19\">Right to Information Act</a>, as a matter of routine, can be marked to the appropriate Commission. The Registry shall henceforth must ask the counsel who files writ petitions to delete the Information Commission from the array of parties. This will not only reduce the paper work and administrative difficulties faced by the Commission, besides saving them draining their meagre resources.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\">\t17.The 1st Respondent/Petitioner, in his Application dated 01.11.2010 addressed to the Public Information Officer of the High Court, Madras, has sought the following information by raising queries to be furnished to him. They are as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">&quot;1.How may Subordinate Judges are there in service in the state of Tamil Nadu.

Since the Public Information Officer of the High Court had not furnished him the required information sought for by him through his letter dated 01.11.2010. In the Appeal filed by the 1st Respondent/Petitioner before the Appellate Authority (Writ Petitioner) dated 20.12.2010, he had sought for the information earlier sought for by him as per his Application dated 01.11.2010. Inasmuch as the 1st Respondent/ Petitioner was not furnished with the requisite informations sought for by him, by the Writ Petitioner/Appellate Authority, he filed Second Appeal before the Tamil Nadu State Information Commission, Chennai praying for issuance of a direction to the Writ Petitioner/Appellate Authority to furnish the informations, as sought for by him, in his letter dated 01.11.2010 with cost and penalty to be imposed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_20\">\t19.The Tamil Nadu Information Commission in Case No.10447/ Enquiry/A/20 issued summons dated 16.03.2011 to the Public Information Officer of the High Court, Madras requiring him to appear before the Commission in person along with all original records on 21.12.2011 at 3.30 p.m. for further consideration of the matter.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_21\">\t20.The Tamil Nadu Information Commission, on 10.01.2012 in Case No.10447/Enquiry/A/11 passed an order by not accepting the argument &quot;un warranted invasion of privacy of individuals&quot; and allowed the Appeal by directing the Petitioner/Public Authority to furnish the details sought for by the 1st Respondent/Petitioner within 15 days from the date of receipt of this order.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_22\">\t21.It is to be borne in mind that under the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_21\">Right to Information Act, 2005</a> as an authority has a rudimentary function to perform either to furnish the information or deny the information. As a matter of fact, there is no specific Article in the Constitution of India which provides for the citizens right to know. However, <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_22\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> provides for freedom of thought and expression which indirectly includes right to obtain information. Further, <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_23\">Article 21</a> guarantees right to life and personal liberty to citizens.

It is to be remembered that the Information Commission is only required to find out whether the endorsement issued by the Public In formation Officer is in confirmity with the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_48\">Right to Information Act, 2005</a> and whether the information which is sought for has been intentionally/deliberately held back or the same has not been furnished within the specified time.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_53\">\t39.It is to be pointed out that in an Appeal filed under <a href=\"/doc/593162/\" id=\"a_49\">Section 19</a> of the Act, under <a href=\"/doc/641541/\" id=\"a_50\">Section 18(4)</a> of the Act, the State Information Commission before passing an order (relating to an information of a third party) has to issue a Notice to the third party for the purpose of providing a reasonable opportunity [obviously, in terms of the Principles of Natural Justice]. Coming to <a href=\"/doc/1369783/\" id=\"a_51\">Section 20</a> of the Act, in regard to the imposition of penalty under <a href=\"/doc/1369783/\" id=\"a_52\">Section 20</a> of the Act, the same is undoubtedly penal in nature. Before awarding any penalty, on an Official/Officer, a reasonable opportunity is to be provided to the deviant concerned. However, the directions/recommendations of the State Information Commission to initiate action against an deviant/ errant Public Information Officer are not binding on the appropriate authority.

The Commission is a Tribunal vested with the appellate power to decide the appeals etc., as per the decision in <a href=\"/doc/1558339/\" id=\"a_53\">Poornaprajna House Building Co-operative Society Limited V.

Union of India, [2013-2-L.W.1] at special page 41 &amp; 42, in paragraphs 99 to 102, wherein it is observed as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_41\">&quot;99.Persons of eminence in public life is also an expression of wide implication and ramifications. It takes in its ambit all requisites of a good citizen with values and having a public image of contribution to the society. Such person should have understanding of concepts of public interest and public good. Most importantly, such person should have contributed to the society through social or allied works. The authorities cannot lose sight of the fact that ingredients of institutional integrity would be applicable by necessary implication to the Commissions and their members. This discussion safely leads us to conclude that the functions of the Chief Information Commissioner and Information Commissioners may be better performed by a legally qualified and trained mind possessing the requisite experience. The same should also be applied to the designation of the first appellate authority, i.e., the senior officers to be designated at the Centre and State levels. However, in view of language of <a href=\"/doc/698257/\" id=\"a_59\">Section 5</a>, it may not be necessary to apply this principle to the designation of Public Information Officer.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_42\">100. Moreover, as already noticed, the Information Commission, is performing quasi-judicial functions and essence of its adjudicatory powers is akin to the Court system. It also possesses the essential trappings of a Court and discharges the functions which have immense impact on the rights/ obligations of the parties. Thus, it must be termed as a judicial Tribunal which requires to be manned by a person of judicial mind, expertise and experience in that field. This Court, while dealing with the cases relating to the powers of the Parliament to amend the Constitution has observed that every provision of the Constitution, can be amended provided in the result, the basic structure of the Constitution remains the same. The dignity of the individual secured by the various freedoms and basic rights contained in Part III of the Constitution and their protection itself has been treated as the basic structure of the Constitution.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_43\">101. Besides separation of powers, the independence of judiciary is of fundamental constitutional value in the structure of our Constitution. Impartiality, independence, fairness and reasonableness in judicial decision making are the hallmarks of the Judiciary. If \u0011Impartiality\u0012 is the soul of Judiciary, `Independence&#x27; is the life blood of Judiciary. Without independence, impartiality cannot thrive, as this Court stated in the case of Union of India v. R. Gandhi, President, Madras Bar Association [(2010) 11 SCC 17].\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_44\">102. The independence of judiciary stricto sensu applies to the Court system. Thus, by necessary implication, it would also apply to the tribunals whose functioning is quasi-judicial and akin to the court system. The entire administration of justice system has to be so independent and managed by persons of legal acumen, expertise and experience that the persons demanding justice must not only receive justice, but should also have the faith that justice would be done.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_57\">\tAlso, in the aforesaid decision at page 42 in paragraph 103, it is held as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_45\">&quot;103. The above detailed analysis leads to an ad libitum conclusion that under the provisions and scheme of the Act of 2005, the persons eligible for appointment should be of public eminence, with knowledge and experience in the specified fields and should preferably have a judicial background. They should possess judicial acumen and experience to fairly and effectively deal with the intricate questions of law that would come up for determination before the Commission, in its day-to-day working. The Commission satisfies abecedarians of a judicial tribunal which has the trappings of a court. It will serve the ends of justice better, if the Information Commission was manned by persons of legal expertise and with adequate experience in the field of adjudication. We may further clarify that such judicial members could work individually or in Benches of two, one being a judicial member while the other being a qualified person from the specified fields to be called an expert member. Thus, in order to satisfy the test of constitutionality, we will have to read into <a href=\"/doc/280060/\" id=\"a_60\">Section 12(5)</a> of the Act that the expression \u0011knowledge and experience\u0012 includes basic degree in that field and experience gained thereafter and secondly that legally qualified, trained and experienced persons would better administer justice to the people, particularly when they are expected to undertake an adjudicatory process which involves critical legal questions and\nniceties of law. Such appreciation and application of legal principles is a sine qua non to the determinative functioning of the Commission as it can tilt the balance of justice either way. Malcolm Gladwell said, \u0013the key to good decision making is not knowledge. It is understanding. We are swimming in the former. We are lacking in the latter\u0014. The requirement of a judicial mind for manning the judicial tribunal is a well accepted discipline in all the major international jurisdictions with hardly with any exceptions. Even if the intention is to not only appoint people with judicial background and expertise, then the most suitable and practical resolution would be that a \u0011judicial member\u0012 and an \u0011expert member\u0012 from other specified fields should constitute a Bench and perform the functions in accordance with the provisions of the Act of 2005. Such an approach would further the mandate of the statute by resolving the legal issues as well as other serious issues like an inbuilt conflict between the Right to Privacy and Right to Information while applying the balancing principle and other incidental controversies. We would clarify that participation by qualified persons from other specified fields would be a positive contribution in attainment of the proper administration of justice as well as the object of the Act of 2005.Such an approach would help to withstand the challenge to the constitutionality of <a href=\"/doc/280060/\" id=\"a_61\">Section 12(5)</a>.&quot;\n</blockquote>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_58\">\t43.At this stage, we deem it appropriate to cite the following decisions in furtherance of substantial cause of justice:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_46\">\t(a)In the decision Kunche Durga Prasad and another V. Public Information Officer, Office of Chief Manager (HR) Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited, Rajamundry &amp; others, [AIR 2010 Andra Pradesh 105] at page 106 in paragraph 6 and 7, it is observed as follows:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_47\">&quot;6.Neither the 1st petitioner nor any other unsuccessful applicants have filed application before the 1st respondent pointing out any grievance. The 2nd respondent, who is an advocate, filed the application seeking information as referred to above. The 1st respondent furnished information on 13.02.2009 wherein it was mentioned that 73 SC candidates were selected; not an individual officer but a committee has selected the candidates; and a list indicating the particulars of posting orders of all the 284 candidates was furnished. So far as the request to furnish the copies of qualification certificates submitted by the selected candidates is concerned, the 1st respondent took the view that such an information is exempted under <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_62\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the Act. The 2nd petitioner filed an appeal under <a href=\"/doc/593162/\" id=\"a_63\">Section 19</a> of the Act before the 3rd respondent. The latter upheld the view taken by the 1st respondent. Therefore, it needs to be seen as to whether the information sought for by the 2nd petitioner i.e. furnishing copies of the qualification certificates of the selected candidates is not exempted under <a href=\"/doc/223928/\" id=\"a_64\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the Act.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_48\">The said provision reads as under:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_49\">8. Exemption from disclosure of information:-- (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, there shall be no obligation to give any citizen,- \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_50\">........\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_51\">(j) information which relates to personal information the disclosure of which has no relationship to any public activity or interest, or which would cause unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the individual unless the Central Public Information Officer or the State Public Information Officer or the appellate authority, as the case may be, is satisfied that the larger public interest justifies the disclosure of such information:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_52\">Provided that the information, which cannot be denied to the Parliament or a State Legislature shall not be denied to any person.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_53\">7.From a perusal of the above, it is evident that the exemption gets attracted under two circumstances namely, (a) if the information is personal in nature and has no relationship to any public activity or interest, and (b) furnishing of the same would cause unwarranted invasion of privacy of an individual. These exemptions are, however, subject to the opinion that may be formed by the Central or State Public Information Officer or the appellate authority that the larger public interest justifies the disclosure of such information.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_54\">\tMoreover, in the aforesaid decision at page 107, in paragraph 10 and 11, it is observed as follows:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_55\">&quot;10.The 2nd petitioner is not able to state as to how the copies of qualification certificates of the selected candidates have any characteristics of public activity or partake public interest. The aggrieved parties including the 1st petitioner have already approached this Court by filing W.P.No.17355 of 2008. Such of the selected candidates who are impleaded in that writ petition would certainly have to defend themselves. Any direction to the respondents herein to furnish the testimonials of the selected candidates to the petitioners would have its own impact upon the pleadings or the stands which the parties to the pending proceedings may take. It may appear to be enterprising or tempting for any one to have access to every possible information for an individual whether it relates to an individual or not. The freedom of an individual to have access to the information cannot be projected to such an extent as to invade the rights of others. Further, <a href=\"/doc/1505894/\" id=\"a_65\">Section 6(2)</a> of the Act cannot be read in isolation, nor can be interpreted to mean that an applicant can seek every information relating to any one. Just as he cannot be compelled to divulge the purpose for which he needs the information, he must respect the right of the other man to keep the facts relating to him, close to his chest, unless compelled by law to disclose the same. It is relevant to mention that even where an individual is placed under obligation to speak, the law can only draw adverse inference from his failure or refused to speak but cannot go further to invade his privacy or private life.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_56\">11.The learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the view taken by the respondents conflicts with the very spirit of <a href=\"/doc/1505894/\" id=\"a_66\">Section 6(2)</a> of the Act. This contention cannot be accepted for the simple reason that <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_67\">Section 8</a> of the Act, on one hand, and the <a href=\"/doc/1910806/\" id=\"a_68\">Section 6</a> of the Act, on the other hand, operate in different and distinct fields. Though <a href=\"/doc/1505894/\" id=\"a_69\">Section 6(2)</a> of the Act enables every individual to seek information without disclosing the purpose, the information that can be furnished to him is subject to the restrictions placed under <a href=\"/doc/758550/\" id=\"a_70\">Section 8</a> of the Act. Therefore, no exception can be taken to the impugned orders.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_57\">\t(b)In the decision Rajasthan Public Service Commission V.

The present case relates to RAS Examination 2007, which have long been concluded and appointments made thereunder. A dissatisfied candidate who is disbelieving in the process of a constitutional body, ought not be allowed to continue pursuing the RPSC and seek information which can affect the efficient working and discharge of its constitutional obligations without any corresponding benefit or relationship to any public interest or activity.

No facet of public function has been left unaffected by the putrefied stinck of corruption. Corruption, thy name is depraved and degraded conduct. Dishonesty is thine true colour; thine corroding effect is deep and pervasive; spreads like lymph-nodes, cancerous cells in human body spreading as wild fire eating away the vital veins in the efficacy of public functions. It is a sad fact that corruption has its roots and semification in the society as whole. In the widest connotation, corruption includes improper or selfish exercise of power and influence attached to a public office. The root of corruption is nepotism and apathy in control on narrow considerations which often extends passive protection to the corrupt officers. The source and succour for acceptability of the judgment to be correct, is the upright conduct, character, absolute integrity and displayed on and off the Bench becomes centre stage of the judicial officer. Fallen standard of rectitude is the bane for lost faith of the people, tending to defeat the constitutional scheme of conferment of the powers of judicial review or decision according to law unless checks and corrective measures are applied and enforced. The conferment of exclusive power of judicial review on the judiciary may become means to personal gain or advantage. The Tymph-nodes (cancerous cells ) of corruption constantly keep creeping into the vital veins of judiciary and the need to stem it out by judicial surgery lies on judiciary itself by its self-imposed or corrective measures or disciplinary action under the doctrine of control enshrined in Articles 235,124(6) of the constitution. It would, therefore, be necessary that there should be constant vigil by the High Court concerned on its subordinate judiciary and self-introspection. What is most necessary is to stem out the proclivity of the corrupt conduct rather than to catch when the corrupt demands made and acceptance of illegal gratification. Corruption in judiciary cannot be committed without some members of the Bar become privy to the corrupt. The vigilant watch by the High court, and many a time by the members of the Bar, is the sustaining stream to catch the corrupt and to deal with the situation appropriately. At the same time the High Court is the protector of the subordinate judiciary. Often some members of the bar, in particular, in Muffasil courts, attempt to take undue advantage of their long standing at the bar and attempt to abuse their standing by bringing or attempting to bring about diverse form of pressures and pin-pricks on junior judicial officers or stubborn and stern and unbendable officers. If they remain unsuccessful, to achieve their nefarious purpose, some members of the Bar indulge in mudslinging without any base, by sending repeated anonymous letters against the judicial officer questioning their performance/capacity/integrity. The High Court should, therefore, take care of the judicial officers and protect them from such unseeming attempts or pressures so as to maintain their morale and independence or the judicial officer and support the honest and upright officers.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_64\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1294854\" id=\"span_7\">47.That apart, in the decision of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/1294854/\" id=\"a_84\">S.P.Gupta and others V.

This Article also confers rule making power on the Chief Justice for regulating the conditions of service of officers and servants of the High Court subject to certain restrictions. The power available to the Chief Justice of the High Court, under <a href=\"/doc/875627/\" id=\"a_99\">Art. 229</a>, is akin to the power of the Chief Justice of India under <a href=\"/doc/33485/\" id=\"a_100\">Art. 146.</a> Just as Chief Justice of India is the supreme authority in the matter of Supreme Court Establishment including its office staff and officers, so also the Chief Justice of the High Court is the sole authority in these matters and no other Judge or officer can legally usurp those administrative functions or power.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_77\">\t59.Be that as it may, on a careful consideration of respective contentions and on going through the contents of the application dated 01.11.2010 filed by the 1st Respondent/Applicant, this Court is of the considered view that the information sought for by him in Serial Nos.1 to 9 pertaining to the internal delicate functioning/administration of the High Court besides the same relate to invasion of privacy of respective individuals if the informations so asked for are furnished and more so, the informations sought for have no relationship to any public activity or interest. Moreover, the informations sought for by the 1st Respondent/ Applicant, through his application dated 01.11.2010 addressed to the Public Information Officer of the High Court, Chennai, are not to a fuller extent open to public domain. Added further, if the informations sought for by the 1st Respondent/Applicant, through his letter dated 01.11.2010 addressed to the Public Information Officer of High Court, are divulged, then, it will open floodgates/Pandora Box compelling the Petitioner/High Court to supply the informations sought for by the concerned Requisitionists as a matter of routine, without any rhyme or reasons/restrictions as the case may be. Therefore, some self restrictions are to be imposed in regard to the supply of informations in this regard. As a matter of fact, the Notings, Jottings, Administrative Letters, Intricate Internal Discussions, Deliberations etc. of the Petitioner/High Court cannot be brought under <a href=\"/doc/13329432/\" id=\"a_101\">Section 2(j)</a> of the Right to Information Act, 2005, in our considered opinion of this Court. Also that, if the informations relating to Serial Nos.1 to 9 mentioned in the application of the 1st Respondent/Applicant dated 01.11.2010 are directed to be furnished or supplied with, then, certainly, it will impede and hinder the regular, smooth and proper functioning of the Institution viz., High Court (an independent authority under the Constitution of India, free from Executive or Legislature), as opined by this Court. As such, a Saner Counsel/Balancing Act is to be adopted in matters relating to the application of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_102\">Right to Information Act, 2005</a>, so that an adequate freedom and inbuilt safeguard can be provided to the Hon&#x27;ble Chief Justice of High Court [competent authority and public authority as per <a href=\"/doc/1822230/\" id=\"a_103\">Section 2(e)(iii)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1097458/\" id=\"a_104\">2(h)(a)</a> of the Act 22 of 2005] in exercising his discretionary powers either to supply the information or to deny the information, as prayed for by the Applicants/Requisitionists concerned.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_78\">\t60.Apart from the above, if the informations requested by the 1st Respondent/Applicant, based on his letter dated 01.11.2010, are supplied with, then, it will have an adverse impact on the regular and normal, serene functioning of the High Court&#x27;s Office on the Administrative side. Therefore, we come to an irresistible conclusion that the 1st Respondent/Applicant is not entitled to be supplied with the informations/details sought for by him, in his Application dated 01.11.2010 addressed to the Public Information Officer of the High Court, Madras under the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_105\">Right to Information Act</a>. Even on the ground of (i) maintaining confidentiality; (ii) based on  the reason that the private or personal information is exempted from disclosure under <a href=\"/doc/159750966/\" id=\"a_106\">Section 8(1)(j)</a> of the Act, 2005; and (iii) also under <a href=\"/doc/1494553/\" id=\"a_107\">Section 8(1)(e)</a> of the Act in lieu of fiduciary relationship maintained by the High Court, the request of the 1st Respondent/Applicant, through his Letter dated 01.11.2010/Appeal dated 20.12.2010 under <a href=\"/doc/593162/\" id=\"a_108\">Section 19</a> of the Act to the Writ Petitioner/Appellate Authority, cannot be acceded to by this Court. Further, we are of the considered view that the 1st Respondent/Applicant has no locus standi to seek for the details sought for by him, as stated supra, in a wholesale, omnibus and mechanical fashion in the subject matter in issue, (either as a matter of right/routine under the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_109\">Right to Information Act</a>) because of the simple reason that he has no enforceable legal right. Also, we opine that the 1st Respondent/Applicant&#x27;s requests, through his Application dated 01.11.2010 and his Appeal dated 20.12.2010, suffer from want of bonafides (notwithstanding the candid fact that <a href=\"/doc/1910806/\" id=\"a_110\">Section 6</a> of the Right to Information Act does not either overtly or covertly refers to the &#x27;concept of Locus&#x27;).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_79\">\t61.To put it differently, if the informations sought for by the 1st Respondent/Applicant, through his letter dated 01.11.2010/Appeal dated 20.12.2010, are divulged or furnished by the Office of the High Court (on administrative side), then, the secrecy and privacy of the internal working process may get jeopardised, besides the furnishing of said informations would result in invasion of unwarranted and uncalled for privacy of individuals concerned. Even the disclosure of informations pertaining to departmental enquiries in respect of Disciplinary Actions initiated against the Judicial Officers/Officials of the Subordinate Court or the High Court will affect the facile, smooth and independent running of the administration of the High Court, under the Constitution of India. Moreover, as per <a href=\"/doc/1812801/\" id=\"a_111\">Section 2(e)</a> of the read with <a href=\"/doc/1606088/\" id=\"a_112\">Section 28</a> of the Right to Information Act, the Hon&#x27;ble Chief Justice of this Court is empowered to frame rules to carry out the provisions of the Act. In this regard, we point out that &#x27;Madras High Court Right to Information (Regulation of Fee and Cost) Rules, 2007&#x27; have been framed [vide R.O.C.No.2636-A/06/F1 \u0016 SRO C-3/2008] in Tamil Nadu Gazette, No.20, dated 21.05.2008, Pt.III, <a href=\"/doc/277989/\" id=\"a_113\">S.2</a>. Also, a Notification, in Roc.No.976 A/2008/RTI dated 18.11.2008, has been issued by this Court to the said Rules, by bringing certain amendments in regard to the Name and Designation of the Officers mentioned therein, the same  has come into force from 18.11.2008.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_80\">\t62.In the upshot of quantitative and qualitative discussions mentioned supra, we hold that the view taken by the 2nd Respondent/ Tamil Nadu Information Commission, Chennai, in Appeal Case No.10447/Enquiry/A/11 dated 10.01.2012 that &#x27;the appellant has asked only for statistical details and not names of individuals&#x27;, is per se not correct. As such, the conclusion arrived at by the 2nd Respondent/ Information Commission, in allowing the Appeal and directing the Petitioner/High Court (Public Authority) to furnish the details within 15 days from the date of receipt of copy of this order, is not sustainable, in the eye of law. Therefore, to prevent an aberration of Justice and to promote substantial cause of Justice, this Court interferes with the order dated 10.01.2012 in Case No.10447/Enquiry/A/11 passed by the 2nd Respondent/Tamil Nadu Information Commission, Chennai and sets aside the same, to secure the ends of Justice. Resultantly, the Writ Petition is allowed. No costs.
