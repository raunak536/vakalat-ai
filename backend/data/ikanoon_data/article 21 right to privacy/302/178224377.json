By this petition, the Petitioner seeks bail pending the enquiry before\nthe Learned Metropolitan Magistrate under the <a href=\"/doc/1502630/\" id=\"a_1\">Extradition Act</a> (in short „the\nAct‟) in regard to LOC No. 2011104148 pursuant to Red Corner Notice No.\nA1251/2-2011.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1330899\" id=\"span_1\">2.      Learned counsel for the Petitioner contends that the Petitioner is a\ncitizen of United States of America (USA) and his entire family is settled in\nUSA. The Petitioner has been falsely implicated by a girl with whom he was\nfamiliar and both of them wanted to marry. The arrest of the Petitioner on\n6th July, 2011 is in violation of the <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_2\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">BAIL APPLN. 1733/2011                                              Page 1 of 13</span>\n since the Petitioner has been arrested under a Red Corner Notice and as held\nby the Hon‟ble Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/1330899/\" id=\"a_3\">Bhavesh Jayanti Lakhani Vs. State of\nMaharashtra &amp; Ors.</a> (2009) 9 SCC 551 a Red Corner Notice is not a warrant\nof provisional arrest.   Thus, in the absence of any provisional arrest,\nPetitioner‟s custody was illegal. Further the so-called warrant of provisional\narrest was neither issued by a judicial authority nor endorsed by the Central\nGovernment. It is contended that till date neither the warrant for provisional\narrest has been endorsed by the Central Government nor the extradition\nMagistrate has issued warrant of arrest. In his application, the Petitioner\nstated that he was provisionally arrested in view of the facts informed by the\nRespondents. The Petitioner was kept in dark and no grounds of arrest were\ninformed to him. The Petitioner was arrested on 6th July, 2011 and in terms\nof <a href=\"/doc/1502630/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 34-B(2)</a> of the Extradition Act, the Petitioner could have been\nkept in custody only for 60 days. He was kept in custody beyond the said\nperiod as the documents for extradition from USA were received only on\n15th September, 2011.      The reply of the Union Government that the\ndocuments were received on 19th August, 2011 on the face of it is incorrect.</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_4\">Since there is no provisional warrant of arrest till date, the Petitioner be\nreleased on bail. On merits it is contended that the complainant and the\nPetitioner were on friendly terms. There is no likelihood of the Petitioner\nabsconding and thus bail be granted to him.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_5\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1330899\" id=\"span_3\">3.      Learned Additional Solicitor General for the Union of India on the\nother hand contends that the Petitioner himself in his application for bail\nadmits that he was provisionally arrested on 6th July, 2011 under the\nprovisions of <a href=\"/doc/1423978/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 34(B)</a> of the Act. A Red Corner Notice was received\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">BAIL APPLN. 1733/2011                                           Page 2 of 13</span>\n on 23rd February, 2011 which also contained the warrants for provisional\narrest.     Hence the decision in <a href=\"/doc/1330899/\" id=\"a_6\">Bhavesh Jayanti Lakhani</a> (supra) is not\napplicable to the facts of the present case. When the Petitioner was produced\nbefore the Learned Metropolitan Magistrate pursuant to his arrest under\n<a href=\"/doc/29599/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 41(1)(g)</a> Cr.P.C., Kalandra was filed, which contained the\ndocuments relating to the look-out circular which had the Red Corner Notice\nalong with the warrant of provisional arrest. Hence, the contention of the\nlearned counsel for the Petitioner that till date warrant of arrest has not been\nissued is incorrect. The letter of Sh.D.K. Ghosh, Deputy Passport Officer-\nExtradition, Under Secretary dated 18th July, 2011 addressed to the Assistant\nDirector, CBI- INTERPOL requesting for provisional arrest is only as a\nmatter of abundant caution and does not mean that there was no warrant for\nprovisional arrest. The Learned Magistrate in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1502630/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 34-B(2)</a> of\nthe Act immediately informed the Central Government about the arrest of\nthe Petitioner which was duly communicated to the National Central Bureau\n(NCB) Washington. The Ministry of External Affairs responded through its\nletter dated 18th July, 2011 forwarding a copy of Note Verbale No. 2011-\n689/CONS dated 11th July, 2011 requesting for provisional arrest of the\nPetitioner for the purpose of extradition as their exists an extradition treaty\nbetween the two countries.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_6\">4.

The Petitioner was arrested at Indira Gandhi International Airport\nunder Section 41(1) G <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_9\">Cr.P.C</a>. pursuant to a Look Out Circular (LOC)\nNo.2011104148 on the basis of the INTERPOL‟s Red Corner Notice bearing\nNo.A1251/2-2011. Red Corner Notice was pursuant to a request of USA for\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">BAIL APPLN. 1733/2011                                             Page 3 of 13</span>\n the extradition of the Petitioner, who is a citizen of USA qua offences on\ncount of rape of first degree and second degree in violation of the New York\nState Penal Law Sections 130.35 and 130.30 entailing a maximum sentence\nof 25 years and 7 years imprisonment respectively besides sexual abuse and\nendangering the welfare of a child. A warrant for arrest of the Petitioner was\nissued by the Supreme Court of County of Nassau in the State of New York\non 17th August, 2009. The Petitioner is also wanted for probation violation\nas he pled guilty on December 21, 2007 and was convicted of attempted\ncriminal possession of a controlled substance in the 5th degree.               The\nPetitioner was sentenced to 5 years probation. The Petitioner violated the\ncondition of his probation when he failed to report to his Probation Officer\non two occasions pursuant to directives and refused to provide a urine\nsample to test for the use of alcohol and controlled substances. The warrant\nof arrest was accompanied by a certificate of authentication dated 12 th\nAugust, 2011 by the First Secretary, Mineola, Washington DC.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_8\">6.      The Red Corner Notice of the requesting country, i.e., the USA was\npublished on 23rd February, 2011 along with the details of the Petitioner‟s\ncharacteristics marks, judicial information, conviction he was facing, arrest\nwarrant and the action to be taken. The Red Corner Notice provided that the\nsame be treated as a formal request for provisional arrest with a further\nrequest to apply for provisional arrest in conformity with the National Laws\nand/or the applicable bilateral and multilateral treaties. The Petitioner was\nformally arrested while entering the Airport for going to Bangkok by Flight\nNo.7397 on 6th July, 2011 under Section 41(1) G <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_10\">Cr.P.C</a>. and produced\nbefore the learned Metropolitan Magistrate. Information in this regard was\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">BAIL APPLN. 1733/2011                                           Page 4 of 13</span>\n given to the Additional Director, Interpole and pursuant thereto a request\nwas made to NCB-Washington DC to send the relevant documents\nimmediately for process of extradition of the Petitioner through proper\ndiplomatic channel. Vide letter dated 18.7.2011 Sh. D.K.Ghosh requested\nthe CBI for provisional arrest of the Petitioner for the purpose of extradition\nunder <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_11\">Article 12</a> of the Extradition Treaty currently operative between India\nand USA and 34(b) of the <a href=\"/doc/1502630/\" id=\"a_12\">Indian Extradition Act, 1962</a> (in short, „the Act‟)\nenclosing a copy of Note Verbale No.2011-689/CONs dated 11th July, 2011.\nThis letter of 18th July, 2011 is the bone of contention in the present petition.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">7.      According to the learned Additional Solicitor General, the Red Corner\nNotice consists of the provisional arrest warrant duly authenticated and\nreceived from the requesting State and thus, this second request for\nprovisional arrest warrant was an idle formality after the Petitioner was\narrested on 6th July, 2011 though initially under <a href=\"/doc/664935/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 14(1)(G)</a> Cr.P.C.\nHowever, on being produced before the learned Metropolitan Magistrate his\nremand was given under <a href=\"/doc/1423978/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 34(B)(2)</a> of the Act on the basis of the\nprovisional arrest warrant already received with the Red Corner Notice.\nCounsel for the Petitioner puts it the other way round and states that till 18 th\nJuly, 2011, the CBI did not even have the provisional warrant of arrest and\nthe Petitioner has not been arrested till date pursuant to a provisional\nwarrant. As the custody of the Petitioner from 6th July, 2011 to 18th July,\n2011 and even thereafter is illegal, thus the Petitioner is entitled to be\nreleased on bail.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_10\">8.      <a href=\"/doc/507354/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 41(1)(G)</a> Cr.P.C. gives power to Police to arrest, without an\norder or warrant from a Magistrate, any person against whom there is a\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">BAIL APPLN. 1733/2011                                              Page 5 of 13</span>\n credible information or reasonable complaint or reasonable suspicion that he\nhas committed an act at any place out of India which if committed in India\nwould have been punishable as an offence and for which he is liable to be\napprehended/detained under custody in India under any law for extradition.\nSince there was Look Out Circular on the basis of Red Corner Notice which\ncontained all the details, prima facie, there was a credible information of the\nPetitioner having committed an extraditable offence and thus the police\nofficer at Indira Gandhi International Airport was justified in arresting the\nPetitioner. On being arrested, the Petitioner was produced before the learned\nMetropolitan Magistrate who remanded him to judicial custody.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_11\">9.      A perusal of the documents accompanying the Red Corner Notice\nwhich have been received through diplomatic channel contained a request\nfor provisional arrest. Thus, prima facie, the requirement of <a href=\"/doc/1502630/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 34B(2)</a>\nof the Act stood satisfied when the Petitioner was remanded to the judicial\ncustody of the learned Metropolitan Magistrate.         A further request for\nprovisional arrest made by the Government of USA would not nullify an\nearlier request for provisional arrest.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"190617985\" id=\"span_8\">10.

We do not need to delve further into this question since\n        there is no repugnancy between the <a href=\"/doc/1502630/\" id=\"a_18\">Extradition Act</a> or any\n        municipal enactment in the USA on the one hand and the\n        provisions of the Indo-US Treaty on the other. In fact, so far as\n        India is concerned, the position is to the contrary.\n        <a href=\"/doc/832258/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 3(3)(c)</a>of the Extradition Act stipulates that &#x27;&#x27;Where the\n        notified order relates to a treaty State the Central Government\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">BAIL APPLN. 1733/2011                                             Page 6 of 13</span>\n         may, by the same or any subsequent notified order, render the\n        application of this Act subject to such modifications,\n        exceptions, conditions and qualifications as may be deemed\n        expedient for implementing the treaty with that State&#x27;. In other\n        words, Parliament has delegated the power of modification of\n        the provisions of extradition to the Central Government. This\n        discussion is necessary for the reason that the provisions of\n        Section 34-B (or for that matter <a href=\"/doc/1342308/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 16</a> falling in Chapter-\n        III) does not contain terms empowering the re-arrest of a\n        fugitive criminal after his discharge or release from provisional\n        arrest. In our opinion, the re- arrest of a fugitive criminal is\n        impliedly sanctioned under the <a href=\"/doc/1502630/\" id=\"a_21\">Extradition Act</a>. It seems to us\n        that <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_22\">Article 12(5)</a> of the Indo-US Treaty sufficiently empowers\n        the re-arrest of a fugitive criminal after his release from\n        provisional arrest. By operation of <a href=\"/doc/832258/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 3(3)(c)</a> of the\n        Extradition Act the said Article of the Indo-US Treaty assumes\n        the qualities of enforceable law. So far as the position obtaining\n        in the USA is concerned, the provisions of the Indo-US Treaty\n        would override municipal/domestic legislation that may have\n        been previously prevailing in the event of any repugnancy.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_13\">        29. The starting point of the period prescribed by <a href=\"/doc/1811765/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 24</a> is\n        the date on which the fugitive criminal (Petitioner) has been\n        committed to prison. The Section does not speak of an arrest.\n        Advanced Law Lexicon clarifies the position thus:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">              &#x27;Arrest&#x27; and &#x27;commit&#x27;. By arrest is to be understood to take\n              the party into custody. To commit is the separate and\n              distinct act of carrying the party to prison, after having\n              taken him into custody by force of the execution&#x27;.\n              &#x27;Commit&#x27; has been explained in Black&#x27;s Law Dictionary\n              to connote the sending of a person to prison, and/or\n              directing an officer to take a person to a penal institution.\n              The same Dictionary defines &#x27;arrest&#x27; as : a seizure or\n              forcible restraint; the taking or keeping of a person in\n              custody by legal authority especially in response to a\n              criminal charge; the apprehension of someone for the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">BAIL APPLN. 1733/2011                                              Page 7 of 13</span>\n                  purpose of securing the administration of the law,\n                 especially for bringing that person before a Court. The\n                 words are not synonymous to each other. In the case in\n                 hand, there was no committal of the Petitioner prior to\n                 18.8.2008, as stands clarified by the Order dated\n                 25.8.2008. If any doubt remains, it would be dispelled by\n                 reading further into the Section. The fugitive criminal\n                 should have been committed to prison either to await his\n                 surrender or for his return to the concerned State. We\n                 must revert back to <a href=\"/doc/1672126/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 7(4)</a> which empowers the\n                 Magistrate to commit the fugitive to prison if the\n                 Magistrate is of the opinion that a prima facie case has\n                 been made out in support of the requisition of the State\n                 concerned. Thereafter, <a href=\"/doc/164727/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 8</a> speaks of the surrender\n                 of the fugitive criminal to the concerned State. Both these\n                 Sections are in <a href=\"/doc/1502630/\" id=\"a_27\">Chapter-II of the Extradition Act</a>. In those\n                 cases where Chapter-III and not Chapter-II is applicable,\n                 if upon making the secretarial, punctilious or formal\n                 inquiry, as postulated by <a href=\"/doc/172234/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 17</a>, the Magistrate is\n                 satisfied that the endorsed Warrant for the apprehension\n                 of the fugitive criminal is duly authenticated and that the\n                 offence of which the person is accused or has been\n                 convicted is an extradition offence, the Magistrate shall\n                 commit the fugitive criminal to prison to await his return,\n                 presumably to the State concerned. <a href=\"/doc/1648695/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 18</a> clarifies\n                 the manner in which the &#x27;return&#x27; is to be effected by the\n                 Central Government. From this analysis, it is obvious\n                 that the words &#x27;surrender&#x27; and &#x27;return&#x27; are terms of art,\n                 having special connotation in the context of the\n                 <a href=\"/doc/1502630/\" id=\"a_30\">Extradition Act</a>. Our conclusion in the present case is that\n                 the prescription contained in <a href=\"/doc/1811765/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 24</a> of the\n                 Extradition Act would commence on 18.8.2008 and two\n                 months would ordinarily have to be computed from that\n                 date.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1330899\" id=\"span_11\">11.

Extradition of a fugitive criminal from India to any other\n        foreign country, irrespective of the fact as to whether any treaty\n        has been entered into or with that country, is within the\n        exclusive domain of the Central Government. The extradition\n        of a person from India to any other foreign country is covered\n        by the Parliament Act, namely, the Act. Keeping in view the\n        Constitution of Interpol vis-à-vis the resolutions adopted by\n        CBI from time to time, although a red corner notice per se does\n        not give status of a warrant of arrest by a competent court, it is\n        merely a request of the issuing authority to keep surveillance on\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">BAIL APPLN. 1733/2011                                              Page 9 of 13</span>\n         him and provisionally or finally arrest the wanted person for\n        extradition.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_15\">        97. The provisions of the Act and the treaty are required to be\n        given effect to. Whenever a request is received from Interpol\n        the authority must act on behalf of the Central Government.\n        Interpol provides constitution of NCBs by Member States. All\n        members are required to constitute NCBs which should be an\n        authority within the meaning of the provisions of Interpol for\n        coordination of the functioning within the Member States\n        and/or Interpol in case of any request received. Location of a\n        missing person and or tracing the whereabouts of a fugitive\n        criminal is not an easy task. The authority within the meaning\n        of the words of Interpol must act in cooperation with the State\n        police. For the said purpose it may have to request more than\n        one States. A missing person or a fugitive criminal may move\n        from one State to another. In such a case it is not possible for\n        one State to find out the missing person or fugitive criminal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_16\">        100. CBI has different roles to play. When it acts as NCB,\n        being a department of CBI, it acts under a treaty. It acts in terms\n        of the Constitution of Interpol. It acts as a authority of the\n        Central Government. By reason of such an act it does not carry\n        out investigation, although it is entitled therefor. It functions as\n        an NCB which is to give effect to the request received from\n        Interpol and/or foreign country. When it does so, indisputably it\n        has to apply its mind. It can take any action only because it is\n        lawful to do so. It does not exercise absolute discretion. It has\n        to act if a case therefor has been made out including the\n        question as whether any extraditable offence has been made\n        out. For the aforementioned purpose it does not Act as an\n        agency within the four corners of the <a href=\"/doc/1692639/\" id=\"a_34\">DSPE Act</a>. It acts, it will\n        be a repetition to state, as an authority of the Central\n        Government.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_17\">        101.

It was further conceded at\nthe bar that a Red Corner Notice by itself cannot be the basis of arrest or\ntransfer of an Indian citizen to a foreign jurisdiction. It was held that such an\narrest can be effected only pursuant to a warrant issued by the Magistrate in\nview of <a href=\"/doc/851218/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 6</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1342308/\" id=\"a_39\">16</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1502630/\" id=\"a_40\">34B</a> of the Act or an arrest warrant issued by a\nforeign country and endorsed by the Central Government under <a href=\"/doc/708559/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 15</a>\nof the Act.

In the present case the Red Corner Notice contained all necessary\ndetails as contemplated in <a href=\"/doc/1481519/\" id=\"a_46\">Article 12(2)</a> of the Extradition treaty like the\nphotographs, details of identification, likely place of visit, a brief statement\nof the facts of the cases, the conviction and sentences awarded, a statement\nof existence of warrant of arrest, action to be taken if traced and request for\nprovisional arrest. Thus the facts of the present case are not akin to that of\nBhavesh Jayanti Lakhani.

Learned ASG has strongly contended that <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_48\">Article 12</a> of the Extradition\nTreaty, having been notified under <a href=\"/doc/1569648/\" id=\"a_49\">Section 3</a> of the Act, entitles the\nrespondents to arrest the Petitioner and said arrest is a provisional arrest\nunder the <a href=\"/doc/1502630/\" id=\"a_50\">Extradition Act</a>. Since the treaty between India and USA is\nnotified, its terms get incorporated under the Act in exercise of the powers\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1569648/\" id=\"a_51\">Section 3</a> modifying the Act to that extent and enables provision for\narrest to be incorporated in the Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_22\">16.     As regards the contention of the Petitioner that he be granted bail on\nmerits, it may be noted that the extradition of the Petitioner is sought on two\ncounts. Firstly, he violated the terms of probation of five years, escaped\nduring the pendency of the probation and secondly while on probation he\nallegedly committed an offence of rape and sexual abuse and endangered the\nwelfare of a child. Even on facts, I do not find that it is a case where the\nPetitioner is entitled to bail.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_23\">17.     I find no merit in the petition.
