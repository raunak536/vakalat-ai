The Plaintiff has filed C.S.(OS) No. 1625 of 1999 to, inter alia,\n\nseek a permanent injunction against the Defendant Company from\n\nissuing any sound recording which embodies the works (literary and\n\nmusical works), in which the copyright is owned by the Plaintiff herein.\n\nThe Plaintiff has also sought an injunction restraining the Defendant\n\nfrom launching sound recordings which are remixed versions of the\n\nsound recordings in which the Plaintiff owns copyright. For the sake of\n\nclarity the sound recordings of the defendant are referred to herein as\n\n&quot;version recordings&quot;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_6\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_7\">3.         The case set up by the Plaintiff is that the Plaintiff is the\n\nowner of copyright in various sound recordings which comprise of lyrics\n\nand background music or the musical score. The Plaintiff also claims to\n\nbe the owner of the copyright in the underlying musical score or\n\ncomposition and the lyrics embodied in the said sound recordings. The\n\nPlaintiff‟s claim is that the Defendant has launched a series of audio\n\ncassettes containing version recordings which violate the copyrights of\n\nthe Plaintiff. The Plaintiff avers that it has not granted any right,\n\npermission or license to the Defendant to make version recordings of\n\nthe works in which it has copyrights.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">4.         The grievance of the Plaintiff is that the audio cassettes titled\n\n&quot;28 Super Non-Stop Remix&quot; Vol. 2, Vol. 3 and Vol. 4 released by the\n\ndefendant contain remix version of songs from the film titles &quot;Hum\n\nAapke Hain Kaun&quot;, &quot;Daur&quot;, &quot;1942 - A Love Story&quot;, &quot;Saudagar&quot;,\n\n&quot;Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge&quot; etc. The copyright in the literary,\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">CS(OS) Nos.1625/1999 &amp; 399/2005                                   Page 2 of 76</span>\n dramatic and musical works in these songs, as well as the copyright in\n\nsound recordings comprising of these songs is claimed by the plaintiff.\n\nThe   Plaintiff   states      that   the    Defendant       Company    had   sought\n\npermission of the Plaintiff to make version sound recordings of the\n\nliterary and musical works forming part of the sound track of the\n\naforesaid titles. The Plaintiff states that it had categorically refused\n\npermission to the Defendant to make such recordings. The grievance\n\nof the Plaintiff is that despite such refusal, the Defendant has gone\n\nahead and made version recordings embodying the lyrics and the\n\nmusical works in which the Plaintiff has copyright, thereby infringing\n\nthe same.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_10\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_11\">5.         The    Plaintiff    states      that   besides   having    infringed   the\n\nPlaintiff‟s copyright in the literary and musical works, the Defendant is\n\nalso guilty of misleading the public by selling the audio cassettes with\n\nsuch inlay cards which contain misleading statements as to the nature\n\nof the version recording, and various declarations to be made under\n\nlaw. The said inlay cards fail to recognize the Plaintiff‟s ownership of\n\ncopyright in the literary and musical works. The mandatory declaration\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/588136/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 52A</a> of the Copyright Act (The Act) has also not been\n\nmade. Even some of the sound recordings/songs seem to be from the\n\noriginal sound track and the other works have either been altered or\n\nmutilated.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_12\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_13\">6.         When CS(OS) No. 1625/1999 came up for hearing on\n\n29.07.1999, the statement of the learned counsel for the defendant\n\nwas recorded that the defendant would not release any cassette in\n\nrespect of any song in which the plaintiff had a copyright. On\n\n13.10.1999, the said statement was confined to the subject matter of\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">CS(OS) Nos.1625/1999 &amp; 399/2005                                           Page 3 of 76</span>\n the suit as mentioned in Prayer A(i) in the light of the Annexure-A filed\n\nwith the plaint. Prayer A(i) in the suit reads as follows:\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">           &quot;A.   The Defendants, its directors, proprietors,\n                 partners, servants, agents, representatives,\n                 distributors and assigns be restrained by\n                 permanent injunctions from:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">           (i)   issuing any sound recording which embody the\n                 copyrights of the Plaintiff and which sound\n                 recordings have been made by the Defendant\n                 without a written license from the Plaintiff, which\n                 in particular includes, but is not restricted to the\n                 musical and literary works embodied in the audio\n                 cassettes set out in Annexure „A‟.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_14\">7.         While the aforesaid suit No.1625/1999 was pending, the\n\nPlaintiff claims to have received two letters. In one of those letters, the\n\nDefendant Company expressed its intention to make 10,000 Video\n\nCompact Disks (VCDs) and 5,000 audio cassettes relating to 14\n\nliterary, dramatic and musical works, the copyright in which vests with\n\nthe Plaintiff. The second letter expressed an intention to make 5,000\n\nAudio Compact Disks (CDs) and 1,000 Digital Video Disks (DVDs).\n\nAdmittedly, the Defendant had sent these letters by taking resort to\n\nthe provisions of <a href=\"/doc/47493925/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 52(1)(j)</a> of the Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_15\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_16\">8.         The    Plaintiff   responded   to   these   letters   by    refusing\n\npermission to the defendant to make any such copies. The Plaintiff‟s\n\nstand was that DVDs and VCDs necessarily contain cinematograph\n\nfilms and do not fall under the category of sound recordings. Therefore,\n\nmaking cinematograph films, which can be sold on the medium of DVD\n\nand VCD, does not fall within the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/47493925/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 52(1)(j)</a> of the\n\nAct.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_17\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_18\">9.         There was some correspondence exchanged between the\n\nparties on this issue, whereafter the Defendant did introduce certain\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">CS(OS) Nos.1625/1999 &amp; 399/2005                                       Page 4 of 76</span>\n VCDs and DVDs. The Plaintiff claims that these VCDs and DVDs violate\n\nits copyrights in various works. Therefore, the Plaintiff filed another suit\n\nbeing C.S.(OS) No. 399 of 2005.        In the said suit the Plaintiff has\n\nsought, inter alia, an injunction to restrain the Defendant from making\n\ncinematograph films embodying the literary and musical works, the\n\ncopyright in which vests with the Plaintiff, without obtaining a license.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_19\">10.        The Defendant has filed its written statements and admits\n\nthat it has been making version recordings of the literary and musical\n\nworks, the ownership of which is claimed by the Plaintiff in these suits.\n\nThe Defendant‟s claim is that it creates fresh sound recordings by\n\nemploying a different set of performers, musicians and artists who use\n\nthe literary and musical works of the Plaintiff. The Defendant‟s case is\n\nthat it is entitled to make such recordings from the works in which\n\nPlaintiff or any other person may own copyright provided the\n\nconditions prescribed in <a href=\"/doc/47493925/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 52(1)(j)</a> are fulfilled. According to the\n\nDefendant, the refusal of the express permission by the owners of the\n\ncopyrights in the original literary, musical and dramatic works is\n\nimmaterial for the purposes of making version recordings.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_20\">11.        I have heard the counsels for the parties at length and\n\nconsidered the statutory provisions and the case law cited by them.\n\nThe entire controversy revolves around interpretation of <a href=\"/doc/47493925/\" id=\"a_5\">Section\n\n52(1)(j)</a> of the Copyright Act 1957 <a href=\"/doc/1136195/\" id=\"a_6\">(The Act</a>).       Since the arguments\n\nhave proceeded on the basis that the plaintiff is the owner of the\n\ncopyrights in the original, literary, musical and dramatic works, of\n\nwhich the defendant has made version recordings, and the defendant‟s\n\ndefence is founded upon <a href=\"/doc/47493925/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 52 (1)(j)</a> of the Act, the submissions\n\nof learned counsel for the defendant are being set out first.\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">CS(OS) Nos.1625/1999 &amp; 399/2005                                   Page 5 of 76</span>\n DEFENDANT‟S STAND\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_21\">12.           The thrust of the submissions of learned counsel for the\n\nDefendant is founded on the plain language of <a href=\"/doc/47493925/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 52(1)(j)</a> of the\n\nCopyright Act, 1957 and Rule 21 of the Copyright Rules, 1958 (The\n\nRules) as amended. Ld. counsel for the Defendant submits that the\n\nfollowing conditions need only be fulfilled before the version recording\n\nor a subsequent sound recording in respect of any literary, dramatic or\n\nmusical work (hereinafter referred to as &quot;the work&quot;) can be made:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">       i)       Sound recordings of that work have been made by, or with\n\n                the consent of, the owner(s) of the copyright in the work(s)\n\n                by a licence from such owner(s). In other words, the\n\n                work(s) must have been authorisedly utilized for making of\n\n                a sound recording before the version recording is made.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">       ii)      The person who intends to make the version recording or\n\n                subsequent sound recording of the work(s) has given a\n\n                notice of his intention to make the sound recording to the\n\n                owner(s) of the copyright in the work(s).\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">       iii)     The said person has also provided the owner(s) of the\n\n                copyright in the work(s), copies of all covers or labels with\n\n                which the version recording or subsequent sound recording\n\n                is to be sold.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">       iv)      The said person has paid in the prescribed manner royalty\n\n                in respect of such version recordings or subsequent sound\n\n                recordings to be made by him at the rate fixed by the\n\n                Copyright Board to the owner(s) of the copyright in the\n\n                work(s).\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">CS(OS) Nos.1625/1999 &amp; 399/2005                                    Page 6 of 76</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_22\"> 13.           The Proviso to Clause (j) of <a href=\"/doc/648260/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 5 (2)(1)</a> adds four further\n\nconditions which are :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">       i)       That no alteration shall be made to the works which have\n\n                not been made previously, by or with the consent of the\n\n                owner(s) of the rights or which are not reasonably\n\n                necessary for the adaptation of the work(s) for the purpose\n\n                of making the sound recording.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">       ii)      The sound recording shall not be              issued with any\n\n                packaging or label which is likely to mislead or confuse the\n\n                public as to their identity.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">       iii)     No such sound recording shall be made until two calendar\n\n                years have expired after the end of the year in which the\n\n                first sound recording of the work was made.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">       iv)      The person making such sound recording shall allow the\n\n                owner(s)   of     the   copyrights   or   his/their   agent(s)    or\n\n                representative(s) to inspect all the recordings and books of\n\n                account relating to such sound recordings.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_23\">14.           The argument of the counsel of Defendant is that once a\n\nliterary, dramatic or musical work has been utilised for the purpose of\n\nmaking sound recordings with the consent of or by the license of the\n\ncopyright owner(s) of such works, and a period of two calendar years\n\nhas expired after the end of the year in which the first sound recording\n\nof such work(s) was made, any person who gives notice of his intention\n\nto make the version recording or subsequent sound recording, and who\n\nhas paid the royalty to the owner(s) at the rate fixed by the Copyright\n\nBoard, may make a subsequent sound recording or version recording\n\nof the work(s), provided he follows the other conditions laid down in\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">CS(OS) Nos.1625/1999 &amp; 399/2005                                          Page 7 of 76</span>\n the said Section and the Copyright Rules. The said Section neither\n\nprescribes nor requires the obtainment of express consent/licence of\n\nthe owner(s) of the copyright in the original literary, dramatic or\n\nmusical work, much less of the owner of the Copyright in the sound\n\nrecording initially made, and the permission is, therefore, in the nature\n\nof a statutory licence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_24\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_25\">15.        The defendant further contends that once such a version\n\nrecording is made under <a href=\"/doc/47493925/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 52(1)(j)</a> the owner thereof gets all\n\nrights conferred by <a href=\"/doc/60721279/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 14(e)</a> on a lawfully made sound recording.\n\nThe thrust of defendant‟s argument is that the right of the owner of\n\ncopyright in the first sound recording and the owner of copyright in\n\nversion recording co-exist and do not overlap. The defendant further\n\ncontends that <a href=\"/doc/47493925/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 52(1)(j)</a> does not place any restrictions on the\n\nuse to which the version recording can be put and the same can be\n\nused even for preparing a cinematograph film which is defined by the\n\nact as images accompanied by sound recording. The version recording\n\ndoes not lose its character of being a sound recording merely on being\n\nincorporated in a cinematograph film. The defendant further contends\n\nthat the provision regarding supply of covers and labels is not\n\nmandatory but a directory provision, and compliance thereof is not\n\nnecessary. The defendant further relies on <a href=\"/doc/134715/\" id=\"a_13\">Article 13</a> of Berne\n\nConvention to contend that the Indian law is in conformity with the\n\nconvention.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_26\">\n\n\nPLAINTIFF‟S STAND\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_27\">16.        Learned counsel for the Plaintiff on the other hand submits\n\nthat the prior consent of the owner(s) of the copyrights in the original\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">CS(OS) Nos.1625/1999 &amp; 399/2005                                Page 8 of 76</span>\n literary, dramatic and musical works, which have earlier been utilized\n\nto make authorized sound recordings, and of the copyright owners in\n\nthe initially made sound recording is essential, and no version\n\nrecording or subsequent sound recording can be made without\n\nobtaining the express consent of such copyright owner(s).\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_28\">17.        Without prejudice to his aforesaid submission, on a demurrer,\n\nthe submission of Mr. Lal, learned counsel for the plaintiff is that even\n\nif we were to assume that the defendant by resort to <a href=\"/doc/47493925/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 52(1)(j)</a> of\n\nthe Act is entitled to make version recordings in respect of the literary,\n\ndramatic or musical works of which earlier sound recordings have been\n\nmade legally, the said right being in the nature of an exception to the\n\ncopyright in the concerned literary, dramatic or musical work, the said\n\nprovision should be narrowly construed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_29\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_30\">18.        He submits that for a version recording made under <a href=\"/doc/47493925/\" id=\"a_15\">Section\n\n52(1)(j)</a> of the Act to be valid and legal, the person making the version\n\nrecording should strictly comply with the provisions of the said section.\n\nSuch a person is obliged to give notice of his intention to make his\n\nsound recordings and to provide copies of all covers or labels in which\n\nthe sound recordings are to be sold, and to pay royalties to the owner\n\nof the copyright in the underlying works, in respect of which such\n\nsound recordings/version recordings are to be made by him, at the rate\n\nfixed by the Copyright Board in this behalf.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_31\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_32\">19.        He submits that while making such recording no alteration\n\ncan be made to the work(s) which have not been made previously by\n\nor with the consent of the owner(s) of the copyrights, or which are not\n\nreasonably necessary for the adaptation of the work for the purpose of\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">CS(OS) Nos.1625/1999 &amp; 399/2005                                 Page 9 of 76</span>\n making the sound recordings.         Thus, according to the plaintiff,\n\nremixing of music is not permitted since it amounts to alteration of\n\nmusical work.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_33\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_34\">20.        He submits that it is also essential that the sound recordings\n\nshould not be issued in any form of packaging or with any label which\n\nis likely to mislead or confuse the public as to their identity.       He\n\nsubmits that the legislature, while prescribing that the person making\n\nthe version recordings shall provide copies of all covers or labels in\n\nwhich the version recordings are to be sold to the owner of the\n\ncopyright in the works, has placed the onus upon the owner to\n\ndetermine whether or not the form of packaging and labels proposed\n\nto be used by the person making the version recordings is likely to\n\nmislead or confuse the public as to their identity.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_35\">21.        He has referred to the various packagings and labels used by\n\nthe defendants for the purpose of selling the version recordings\n\nproduced by them to submit that they are highly misleading and\n\nconfusing.

The scheme of the Act, as to grant of licences and\n\nassignments is clear. Wherever under the Act the Copyright Board is\n\nauthorized to issue a compulsory licence, provision has been made for\n\nmaking an application to the Board for the said purpose. However,\n\n<a href=\"/doc/47493925/\" id=\"a_64\">Section 52(1)(j)</a> of the Act does not require any application to be made\n\nfor obtaining consent/licence either to the Copyright Board or to owner\n\nof the Copyright(s) in the work(s) already authorizedly utilized for\n\nmaking a sound recording, much less to the owner of the copyright in\n\nthe earlier made sound recording. Had the said provision intended that\n\nexpress, or even implied consent of such owner(s) is essential, it would\n\nhave specifically said so. In any event, if prior permission from such\n\nowners was essential, then there was no need for enacting <a href=\"/doc/1013176/\" id=\"a_65\">Section 52</a>,\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">CS(OS) Nos.1625/1999 &amp; 399/2005                                   Page 23 of 76</span>\n as <a href=\"/doc/291394/\" id=\"a_66\">Section 30</a> (which provides for voluntary licence) would have\n\nadequately taken care of the situation. It also cannot be said that to\n\nmake a new sound recording a compulsory licence from the Copyright\n\nBoard is required to be obtained as there is no provision for making\n\nany application to the Copyright Board for this purpose, and had such a\n\nlicence been required there was, again, no need to place the provision\n\nconcerned in <a href=\"/doc/1013176/\" id=\"a_67\">Section 52</a>.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_73\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_74\">42.        <a href=\"/doc/1013176/\" id=\"a_68\">Section 52</a> protects certain actions which otherwise would\n\namount to an infringement of copyright. Evidently, exploitation of the\n\nliterary, dramatic or musical work(s) for making a sound recording with\n\nthe consent of the owner of copyright(s) or by compulsory licence from\n\nthe Board cannot be considered to be an infringement. Where such\n\nexpress consent/licence is obtained either voluntarily from the\n\nowner(s) or a compulsory licence is obtained from the Copyright Board,\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1013176/\" id=\"a_69\">Section 52</a> would have no application. Only if the conditions set out in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1013176/\" id=\"a_70\">Section 52</a> are satisfied, the action would be saved from being\n\ncondemned as infringement of copyright.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_75\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_76\">43.        There seems to be no ambiguity in the language employed\n\nby the legislature in formulating <a href=\"/doc/47493925/\" id=\"a_71\">Section 52(1)(j)</a>. Therefore, the golden\n\nrule of construction need only be employed. The plain literal\n\nconstruction of the said Section is also in consonance with the scheme\n\nof the Act and the textual and contextual setting in which the said\n\nprovision appears. I may notice that similar distribution of rights\n\ninvolving &quot;statutory licencing&quot; is prevalent in Australia (as is evident\n\nfrom the decision of the Federal Court of Australia in CBS Records\n\nAustralia Ltd. &amp; Ors. V. Telmak Teleproducts (Aust.) Pvt. Ltd. 8\n\nIPR 473), in U.S.A. (as is evident from the commentary &quot;KOHN ON\n\nMUSIC LICENSING&quot;, extracts from 2nd edition of which has been filed\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">CS(OS) Nos.1625/1999 &amp; 399/2005                               Page 24 of 76</span>\n by learned counsel for the defendant). Also filed on record is extract of\n\n&quot;Copyright Principles&quot;, Law and Practice by Paul Goldstein\n\nVol.1, which is to the same effect.             World Copyright Law -\n\nProtection of Author&#x27;s Works, Performances, Phonograms,\n\nFilms, Video, Broadcasts and Published Editions in National,\n\nInternational and Regional Law (1998 edition) by J.A.L. Sterling\n\nLL.B. is also to the same effect.         No doubt, the Law of compulsory\n\nlicencing has undergone a change in the U.K. and the same has been\n\ndone away with the enactment of the 1988 Act &quot;in recognition of the\n\nfact that the conditions of the market had long since changed and that\n\nhave had been a breakdown of the consensus=..............&quot; (see\n\nCopinger and Skone James on Copyright, 15th edition, 2005), but\n\nthe fact remains that prior to 1988, even in the U.K. compulsory\n\nlicencing was prevalent. In India, statutory licencing is very much a\n\npart of the law as embodied in, inter alia, <a href=\"/doc/1013176/\" id=\"a_72\">Section 52</a> and merely\n\nbecause in the U.K. the same has been abolished in 1988 is no ground\n\nto give a restricted interpretation to the provisions of the Act, which do\n\nnot admit of any ambiguity in their interpretation. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"383397\" id=\"span_25\">The Supreme Court\n\nhas held in <a href=\"/doc/383397/\" id=\"a_73\">Gramophone Company of India Limited v.

The law grants him the right to exclusively make\n\nsound recordings and the rights which go with it (under <a href=\"/doc/60721279/\" id=\"a_81\">Section 14 (e)</a>)\n\nuntil the expiration of two calendar years after the end of the year in\n\nwhich the first recording of the work was made.

Therefore, the court\n\nfound that &quot;in order to attract the provision of <a href=\"/doc/47493925/\" id=\"a_151\">Section 52 (1) (j)</a> of the\n\nAct or to fall outside the scope of <a href=\"/doc/132840469/\" id=\"a_152\">Section 2 (m)</a> of the Act it was\n\nimperative to plead and establish these aspects&quot;. Therefore, the\n\ndecision of the High Court was set aside and it was left open to the\n\nparties to lay down the factual foundation for the same by way of\n\namendment or otherwise. I find that the Supreme Court did not\n\nexpress any opinion one way or another on the merits of the rival\n\ninterpretations being canvassed in respect of <a href=\"/doc/47493925/\" id=\"a_153\">Section 52(1)(j)</a> by the\n\nparties or the one adopted by the Hon‟ble High Court of Karnataka.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_117\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"999762\" id=\"span_58\">56.        The next decision on which much emphasis has been laid by\n\nthe plaintiff is of a Single Judge of this High Court in <a href=\"/doc/999762/\" id=\"a_154\">Super Cassette\n\nIndustries Ltd. Vs. Bathla Cassette Industries Pvt. Limited</a> 2003\n\n(27) PTC 280 (Del). The Ld. Single Judge was seized of a matter\n\nwhere the plaintiff was seeking to injunct the defendant from violating\n\nits copyright in the version recordings made by the Plaintiff therein.\n\nThe defendant raised a defence that the plaintiff‟s recording were not\n\nmade in compliance with <a href=\"/doc/47493925/\" id=\"a_155\">Section 52(1) (j)</a> of the Act        and since the\n\nsound recordings of the plaintiff infringed the copyright of a third party,\n\nthe plaintiff never possessed any copyright in its sound recordings. It\n\nwas pleaded that any sound recording made by resort to <a href=\"/doc/1013176/\" id=\"a_156\">Section 52</a>\n\ncannot be subject matter of protection under the provisions of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1136195/\" id=\"a_157\">Copyright Act</a>, as such a sound recording is a derived product and not\n\nan original work.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_118\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_59\">CS(OS) Nos.1625/1999 &amp; 399/2005                                 Page 37 of 76</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_119\"> 57.        The plaintiff <a href=\"/doc/999762/\" id=\"a_158\">in that case</a> had claimed that by engaging a new\n\norchestra and singer, a new sound recording was produced while\n\nemploying lyrics (literary work) and musical composition (the musical\n\nwork), [the Copyright(s) in which vested with a third party].    It was\n\nargued that a substantially new work had been created by the plaintiff\n\ntherein.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_120\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_121\">58.        The learned Judge concluded that while the notice under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1013176/\" id=\"a_159\">Section 52</a> gave no indication of any adaptation of modification in the\n\nwork sought to be converted into a sound recording under <a href=\"/doc/1013176/\" id=\"a_160\">Section 52</a>,\n\nthe plaintiff did indeed substantially alter the work by engaging a\n\ndifferent orchestra and signer. The learned Judge held that there was\n\nnon-compliance of Rule 21(2)(b) as, in the notice given to the owner of\n\nthe copyrights in the literary, dramatic and musical works, no\n\nalteration or omission to the work was specified, except for a bare\n\naverment that the alterations, if any, will only be made if they are\n\nreasonably necessary for the adoption of the work to the record in\n\nquestion. The learned Single Judge held the plaintiff to his averment in\n\nthe suit that a substantially new arrangement had come into being\n\nwhile making the version recordings, and since the consent of the\n\noriginal copyright owner in the literary, dramatic and musical works\n\nhad not been obtained, the court held that the conditions of <a href=\"/doc/47493925/\" id=\"a_161\">Section\n\n52(1)(j)</a> and Rule 21(2)(b) had not been complied with.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_122\">59.        The learned Single Judge took the view that a change of the\n\nsinger who sings the same lyrics to the same musical score for\n\nproducing the version recording amounts to an alteration, which\n\ncannot be said to be reasonably necessary for adaptation of the work\n\nto the record in question. The learned Judge held that a change of the\n\nsinger in a vocal recording is a change in the most vital constituent of\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_60\">CS(OS) Nos.1625/1999 &amp; 399/2005                              Page 38 of 76</span>\n the recorded song and it cannot be done without the previous\n\npermission of the owner of the original recording as per the mandate of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/47493925/\" id=\"a_162\">Section 52(1)(j)</a> of the Act. He held that to construe <a href=\"/doc/47493925/\" id=\"a_163\">Section 52(1)(j)</a> to\n\ngive an avenue to version recordings which involve the change of\n\nsinger / or orchestra without consent of the original owner would\n\namount to encouraging and putting premium on what, in his view,\n\nconstitutes a blatant and an ill-concealed attempt to plagiarize under\n\nthe misconstrued interpretation of <a href=\"/doc/47493925/\" id=\"a_164\">Section 52(1)(j)</a>. He also was of the\n\nview that a version recording cannot be considered to be an\n\nindependent sound recording entitled to an independent copyright.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_123\">60.        From the decision it appears that the learned Single Judge\n\nwas of the view that a new sound recording or version recording\n\nproduced by utilizing the same lyrics and musical composition infringes\n\nthe copyright of the owner of the previous sound recording.               The\n\nlearned Single Judge also appears to be of the view that the works\n\nreferred to in <a href=\"/doc/47493925/\" id=\"a_165\">Section 52(1)(j)</a>, of which a sound recording is to be\n\nmade, includes any previously made sound recording.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_124\">61.        The learned Single Judge gave the following interpretation to\n\n<a href=\"/doc/47493925/\" id=\"a_166\">Section 52(1)(j)</a>:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_95\">              &quot;22. Thus <a href=\"/doc/47493925/\" id=\"a_167\">Section 52(1)(j)</a> must, therefore, be\n              interpreted to mean as follows:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_96\">              (a)    If a sound recording under <a href=\"/doc/47493925/\" id=\"a_168\">Section\n              52(1)(j)</a> is to be made there should be prior\n              consent of the owner when a change as\n              significant as the change of the singer is being\n              contemplated. This is clearly indicated by the\n              fact that the integrity of the original sound\n              recording in question which is a vocal\n              rendering is clearly affected by the substitution\n              of the singer. Such a change may not be\n              discernible to a lay listener as is indeed the\n              finding after listening to and comparing the\n              plaintiff‟s tape and the original work. However\n              to the owner of the sound recording, the vital\n              substitution of the singer is clearly a change\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_61\">CS(OS) Nos.1625/1999 &amp; 399/2005                                   Page 39 of 76</span>\n               which cannot fall within a change necessary for\n              adaptation of the work as neither a change has\n              been made by the original owner of the work\n              nor has permission        been granted for the\n              plaintiff‟s adaptation by the original owner.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_97\">              (b)   In case the prior consent of the owner is\n              not forthcoming for such changes, a sound\n              recording under <a href=\"/doc/47493925/\" id=\"a_169\">Section 52(1)(j)</a> cannot be\n              made in law and in any case even if made\n              acquires no legally enforceable rights.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_98\">              (c)    Even proceeding on the assumption that\n              <a href=\"/doc/47493925/\" id=\"a_170\">Section 52(1)(j)</a> was complied by and available\n              to the plaintiff, such a recording is at the\n              highest only entitled to protection against an\n              action by the original owner averring copyright\n              infringement. Such a version recording\n              produced under <a href=\"/doc/47493925/\" id=\"a_171\">Section 52(1)(j)</a> cannot in any\n              even acquire independent rights capable of\n              assertion against other alleged infringers.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_125\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"381815\" id=\"span_62\">62.        With utmost respect to the learned Judge and after having\n\ngiven my deep consideration to <a href=\"/doc/999762/\" id=\"a_172\">the said decision</a> in the light of the\n\nstatutory provisions and the earlier cited case law, I am of the view\n\nthat the decision in <a href=\"/doc/381815/\" id=\"a_173\">Super Cassettes Industries</a> (supra) does not\n\nconstitute a binding precedent and even otherwise is per incurium. As\n\nnoticed hereinabove the Division Bench while deciding FAO (OS)\n\n28/1999 arising out of Gramophone II held that <a href=\"/doc/381815/\" id=\"a_174\">the said decision</a> did\n\nnot constitute a binding precedent as the observations made by the\n\nlearned Judge were tentative in nature and so was the view taken by\n\nhim.   This was so held as the learned Single Judge while deciding\n\nGramophone II was dealing with an application under Order 39 Rule 1\n\nand 2 <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_175\">CPC</a> and by <a href=\"/doc/381815/\" id=\"a_176\">the said decision</a> the suit itself had not been decided\n\nfinally. The Division Bench, in its order dated 04.02.2003 in FAO(OS)\n\n28/1999 observed as follows:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_99\">              &quot;At this stage, Ld. Counsel for Appellant\n              expressed the apprehension that the view\n              taken by the Ld. Trial Judge while disposing of\n              the interim stay matter was likely to influence\n              the pending suit proceedings and was likely to\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_63\">CS(OS) Nos.1625/1999 &amp; 399/2005                                 Page 40 of 76</span>\n               be taken as a precedent in identical\n              proceedings.     The apprehension of the Ld.\n              Counsel for Appellant is misplaced because\n              observations made by the Ld. Trail Judge were\n              tentative in nature and so was the view taken\n              by him because the issues raised in the Suit\n              involving interpretation of relevant provisions\n              of the Act were still pending adjudication and\n              final decision in the Suit. These observations\n              would not naturally, therefore, constitute any\n              binding precedent. Nor could these have any\n              bearing in the final decision of the Suit or any\n              other proceeding pending between the\n              parties.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_126\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"381815\" id=\"span_64\">63.         Similarly, the decision of the learned Single Judge in <a href=\"/doc/381815/\" id=\"a_177\">Super\n\nCassettes Industries</a> (supra) is a decision rendered by the learned\n\nSingle Judge on an application under Order 39 Rules 1 and 2 <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_178\">CPC</a> and\n\n<a href=\"/doc/381815/\" id=\"a_179\">the said decision</a> is not a final judgment in the suit. By the same logic\n\nthe view taken by the learned Single Judge is tentative in nature and\n\ndoes not constitute a binding precedent.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_127\">64.         <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"381815\" id=\"span_65\">In any event, I am of the view that <a href=\"/doc/381815/\" id=\"a_180\">the said decision</a> is per\n\nincurium for the following reasons:</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_128\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_100\">       A.     The interpretation given by the learned Single Judge to\n\n       <a href=\"/doc/47493925/\" id=\"a_181\">Section 52(1)(j)</a> to the effect that a change of singer is a\n\n       significant change and, therefore, requires prior consent of the\n\n       owner is contrary to the earlier interpretation given to <a href=\"/doc/47493925/\" id=\"a_182\">Section 52\n\n       (1)(j)</a> in Gramophone I, para 5 whereof has already been\n\n       extracted above. In Gramophone I the court held that version\n\n       recordings involving another voice or voices with different\n\n       musicians and the arrangers does not amount to either copy or\n\n       reproduction of the original recording. The learned Single Judge\n\n       has not considered the earlier view in Gramophone I and the\n\n       same has not been distinguished by him.

A perusal of sub-\n\n       para (a) of para 22 of the decision in <a href=\"/doc/381815/\" id=\"a_187\">Super Cassettes\n\n       Industries</a> (supra) shows that the learned Single Judge assumed\n\n       the existence of a copyright in the owner of the sound recording\n\n       against all others who may wish to make a version recording (by\n\n       utilizing the original literary, dramatic and musical works\n\n       comprised in the           earlier sound recording)   such that     his\n\n       consent/licence is required before making a version recording.\n\n       While arriving at this finding, <a href=\"/doc/60721279/\" id=\"a_188\">Section 14(e)</a> (which vests only\n\n       limited rights in the owner of a sound recording, namely, the\n\n       right to make any other sound recording embodying it, or to\n\n       commercially exploit the same, or communicate the same to the\n\n       public), and the provision in <a href=\"/doc/43316752/\" id=\"a_189\">Section 13(4)</a> which protects the\n\n       copyright of the owner in the underlying literary, dramatic or\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_69\">CS(OS) Nos.1625/1999 &amp; 399/2005                                   Page 42 of 76</span>\n        musical work appear to have escaped the attention of learned\n\n       Single Judge. In fact, a perusal of <a href=\"/doc/47493925/\" id=\"a_190\">Section 52(1)(j)</a> shows that the\n\n       person desirous of making a version recording is not even\n\n       required to put to notice the owner of the copyright in the earlier\n\n       made sound recording. Even the royalties are not payable to the\n\n       owner of the copyright in the earlier made sound recording. The\n\n       notice is to be given, and the royalties are to be paid to the\n\n       owner(s) of the copyright in the original literary, dramatic and\n\n       musical works which are intended to be utilized for making a\n\n       version recording.         Even this aspect appears to have escaped\n\n       consideration of the learned Single Judge.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_131\">       C.     The version recording is meant to be a different recording\n\n       made by utilizing either the same or a different set of singers,\n\n       musicians and artists.          However, while making the version\n\n       recording the producer is bound to maintain the integrity of the\n\n       original literary, dramatic and musical works, except to the\n\n       extent as may be reasonably necessary for the adoption of the\n\n       work for the purpose of making the sound recordings. This is so\n\n       provided in recognition of the moral rights of the author\n\n       protected under <a href=\"/doc/1710491/\" id=\"a_191\">Section 57</a> of the Act.

This is the position when owner‟s copyright in such\n\n       primary works subsists.        However, upon expiry of term of\n\n       copyright in such primary works the same falls in public domain\n\n       and becomes available for exploitation by others in all possible\n\n       ways.

In the first place, I\n              think it is worth pointing out that the special\n              copyright given by s. I9, if the record is made\n              with the consent of the owner of the original\n              work, may subsist for many years after his\n              copyright has come to an end. . . . This, I think,\n              tends to shows that the copyright conferred by\n              s. I9 is not confined to cases where there\n              subsists a copyright in the original work at the\n              time when the record was made and I do not\n              think there is anything in the rest of the section\n              which would lead to that restricted view. . . It\n              follows from this consideration that the records\n              referred to in s. I9 may be records of a work\n              which, to use the well-known phrase, is in the\n              public domain; secondly, they may be records\n              made by the consent of the owner of the\n              original work; and thirdly, they may be records\n              of musical works made under the compulsory\n              provisions of sub-s. (2).\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_115\">              &quot;The next point which I think if of importance is\n              that sub-s (I) gives no special rights to the\n              person who first makes a record of an original\n              work. . . . Since there may be any number of\n              records made under the provisions of sub-s (2)\n              it is evident that there may be numerous\n              records of a musical work, each record being,\n              under s. I9, one with its own term of copyright,\n              and in each case the owner of what is called\n              the original plate from which the record was\n              made is to be deemed „the author of the work‟\n              . . . it is reasonably clear, I think, that the work\n              in that subsection must mean the work as\n              embodied in the record.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_116\">              &quot;The obvious question that then arises is this:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_117\">              What is the position of the owner of the\n              copyright in the original work so far as regards\n              performance in public?          Counsel for the\n              plaintiffs, not unnaturally I think in this case at\n              any rate, argued that the right of the original\n              owner as regards a performance in public was\n              not interfered with by the existence of a\n              copyright under s. I9. I think an admission of\n              that kind was probably necessary for his\n              purpose. In my opinion the admission was\n              rightly made. I see no reason for thinking that\n              the copyright in the original work is interfered\n              with by the creation of a special copyright in\n              what I have called for brevity a record.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_82\">CS(OS) Nos.1625/1999 &amp; 399/2005                                      Page 50 of 76</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_144\"> 68.        I, therefore, reject the submissions of learned counsel for the\n\nplaintiff that the defendant was obliged to seek express consent or\n\npermission of the plaintiff to make version recordings of the literary,\n\ndramatic and musical works of the plaintiff as, admittedly, the literary,\n\ndramatic and musical works in question in which the plaintiff\n\npresumably owns the copyright had been utilized for making sound\n\nrecordings earlier in an authorized manner and the period of two years\n\nafter the end of the year in which the first recordings of the works were\n\nmade had expired when the defendant sought to make the version\n\nrecordings.    I also reject the contention that making of remixes or\n\nversion recordings by use of a different orchestra, singer etc. amounts\n\nto alteration of primary works being exploited for making such version\n\nrecording.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_145\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_146\">69.       So far as the submission of Mr. Lal with regard to the\n\ndefendant‟s right to exploit its version recording being limited only by\n\nsale or hire of the version recordings along with the approved label;\n\nand his submission that the defendant cannot exploit its version\n\nrecordings for sale or hire in any other manner including by licensing\n\nthe use of the same as ring tones on mobile phones or over the\n\ninternet is concerned, I do not agree with his submission and therefore,\n\nreject the same.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_147\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_148\">70.       Once a version recording in compliance with <a href=\"/doc/47493925/\" id=\"a_229\">Section 52(1)(j)</a>\n\nhas been made, it is as much a sound recording as any other sound\n\nrecording would be of the original literary, dramatic or musical work\n\nwhich may have been made under a specific license from the author of\n\nsuch original works. Merely because it is a version recording made by\n\nresort to <a href=\"/doc/47493925/\" id=\"a_230\">Section 52(1)(j)</a>, such version recording does not cease to\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_83\">CS(OS) Nos.1625/1999 &amp; 399/2005                                Page 51 of 76</span>\n have any of the characteristics of a sound recording. Therefore, even\n\nthe copyright holder in a version recording, which is a sound recording,\n\nwould be entitled:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_149\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_118\">              &quot;(i) to make any other sound recording\n                   embodying it;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_119\">              (ii) to sell or give on hire, or offer for sale or\n                   hire, any copy of the sound recording,\n                   regardless of whether such copy has been\n                   sold or given on hire on earlier occasions;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_120\">              (iii) to communicate the sound recording to\n                    the public.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_150\">71.       It is argued before me that the U.S. Copyright Statute\n\nspecifically limits the right of the owner of version recordings to the\n\ndistribution of copies, i.e. only if the &quot;... primary purpose in making\n\nphono records is to distribute them to the public for private use,\n\nincluding by means of a digital phono record delivery&quot;. I am not called\n\nupon to interpret the language used in the U.S. Copyright Statute.\n\nAssuming that the rights of the copyright owner in a version recording\n\nare limited under the U.S. Copyright Statute, that by itself would not be\n\na reason for me to adopt an interpretation in respect of the <a href=\"/doc/1136195/\" id=\"a_231\">Indian\n\nCopyright Act</a>, which is not supported by the plain language of the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1136195/\" id=\"a_232\">Indian Copyright Act</a>.       I have already referred to herein above the\n\ndecision of the Supreme Court in Gramophone V, wherein the\n\nSupreme Court has clearly held that Indian Courts have to enforce the\n\nIndian law and where the Indian law is at variance with the\n\nInternational Law, the courts would adopt an interpretation to advance\n\nthe Indian law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_151\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_152\">72.       The rights of the owner of copyright in version recordings\n\nincludes the exclusive right to issue copies of the version recording\n\n(see <a href=\"/doc/107329709/\" id=\"a_233\">Section 14(e)(ii)</a>) and there is no limitation under the Copyright\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_84\">CS(OS) Nos.1625/1999 &amp; 399/2005                                    Page 52 of 76</span>\n Act with regard to the format in which the version recording may be\n\nsold or hired.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_153\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_154\">73.       The concept of the law does not change merely on account of\n\nthe march of science and technology. The same principles continue to\n\ngovern the field even after the advent of new technology. Numerous\n\nformats in which sound recordings are distributed have been evolved\n\nwith the passage of time, such as audio magnetic tapes, compact disks\n\nand digital copies which are distributed electronically over the internet\n\nor through mobile telephones. In my view, the right of the owner of\n\nthe copyright in the version recording to sell or give on hire or offer for\n\nsale or hire the version recording, and his right to communicate his\n\nversion recording to the public is in no manner curtailed by reference\n\nto the format in which the version recording may be sold or hired or\n\noffered for sale or hire. There is no limitation contained in the Act\n\nwhich prohibits the exploitation of the version recordings by sale/hire\n\nof copies of the version recording, as a version recording through\n\nmobile telephones or through the internet. There is nothing in the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1136195/\" id=\"a_234\">Copyright Act</a> from which it might be inferred that the Parliament\n\nintended to limit the statutory license under <a href=\"/doc/47493925/\" id=\"a_235\">Section 52(1)(j)</a> to any\n\nparticular mode of distributing copies of the version recording.\n\nHowever, the making of copies of the version recording and its sale\n\nmust comply with the requirements of <a href=\"/doc/47493925/\" id=\"a_236\">Section 52(1)(j)</a> and Rule 21 of\n\nthe Copyright Rules.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_155\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_156\">74.       The submission of Mr. Lal is that the requirement in <a href=\"/doc/47493925/\" id=\"a_237\">Section\n\n52(1)(j)(ii)</a>, which obliges the person making the version recording to\n\nprovide &quot;copies of all covers or labels with which the sound recordings\n\nare to be sold&quot; indicates that the version recording can only be sold or\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_85\">CS(OS) Nos.1625/1999 &amp; 399/2005                                 Page 53 of 76</span>\n hired through the medium or in the format of video disk, magnetic tape\n\nor compact disks, as it is only these formats which are sold or hired or\n\noffered for sale or hire with covers or labels. He submits that sale or\n\nhire or offer for sale or hire over the internet and over mobile phones\n\ndoes not require any covers or labels. However, this submission of Mr.\n\nLal does not impress me.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_157\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_158\">75.       As aforesaid, at the time when the relevant provision was\n\nframed, the concept of sale or hire of sound recordings over the\n\ninternet or mobile phones was not only non-existent but beyond the\n\nimagination of the Legislature.    As aforesaid, these are the result of\n\nevolution of science and technology.      The expression &quot;all covers or\n\nlabels&quot; used in <a href=\"/doc/47493925/\" id=\"a_238\">Section 52(1)(j)(ii)</a> has to be understood in a wider\n\nsense and is not to be confined merely to the covers and labels in\n\nprinted format only. Covers and labels are used to identify the product\n\nwhich is sold or hired or offered for sale or hire. Therefore, in my view,\n\neven the mere title of a sound recording comprising of the opening\n\nwords (mukhda) of the song; the name given to a musical theme; the\n\nname of the cinematograph film in which the sound recording may\n\nhave been used; the name of singer (such as Lata Mangeshkar); the\n\nname of the musical composer (such as Laxmikant Pyarelal); the name\n\nof the artist (such as Pandit Ravi Shankar); the icon displaying the\n\nphotograph/picture of the artist or a still from the cinematograph film\n\nin which the same or earlier sound recording may have been used,\n\nwould also constitute covers and labels, as these names\\photographs\\\n\npictures\\icons are used for the purpose of identification of the version\n\nrecording to enable the prospective customer to make his choice and\n\nto identify the product that is on offer for sale or hire and that he would\n\nbe buying/hiring.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_159\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_86\">CS(OS) Nos.1625/1999 &amp; 399/2005                                 Page 54 of 76</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_160\"> 76.       Having said this, the obligations cast by the Act on the owner\n\nof the copyright in version recordings, before commercially exploiting\n\nthe same may be noted. The person making the sound recordings is\n\nobliged to comply with the conditions contained in <a href=\"/doc/47493925/\" id=\"a_239\">Section 52(1)(j)(i)</a>\n\nand (ii) and the provisos set out after <a href=\"/doc/47493925/\" id=\"a_240\">section 52(1)(j)(ii)</a>.    The said\n\nconditions would continue to bind the person making the version\n\nrecording, irrespective of the format in which the version recording\n\nmay be exploited as a version recording. Therefore, even if the copies\n\nof the version recordings are sold or hired, or offered for sale or hire\n\nover the internet or mobile phones, the producer/owner of the\n\ncopyright in the version recording is obliged to ensure that the spirit\n\ncontained, inter alia, in clause (ii) read with proviso (ii) of <a href=\"/doc/47493925/\" id=\"a_241\">section\n\n52(1)(j)</a> are complied with. The purpose of clause (ii) and proviso (ii) to\n\n<a href=\"/doc/47493925/\" id=\"a_242\">Section 52(1)(j)</a> is to ensure that the person making and marketing the\n\nversion recordings, by resort to <a href=\"/doc/47493925/\" id=\"a_243\">Section 52(1)(j)</a> does not mislead or\n\nconfuse the public as to their identity as version recordings. The\n\npurpose is to prevent any confusion in the minds of the public that\n\nwhat is being offered by the producer of the version recordings is his\n\nversion recording, and not any other earlier sound recording or version\n\nrecording of the same literary, dramatic or musical work(s). Therefore,\n\nwhen a person making a version recording sells or hires or offers for\n\nsale or hire his version recording as ring tones on mobile phones, in my\n\nview, it is essential for him to clearly state that the same is his version\n\nrecording. It would not be enough for him to merely indicate the title\n\nof the song or other composition of which he has made the version\n\nrecording for the purpose of identifying the same. Similarly, when the\n\nperson making the version recording sells or hires or offers for sale or\n\nhire his version recording over the internet along with the title/icon of\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_87\">CS(OS) Nos.1625/1999 &amp; 399/2005                                 Page 55 of 76</span>\n the version recording, it should be clearly stated on the website\n\nconcerned that the same is his version recording, and if a label/icon is\n\ndisplayed, the same should also conform with the requirements of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/47493925/\" id=\"a_244\">Section 52(1)(j)</a>.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_161\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_162\">77.    The plaintiff has also made a grievance that the covers and\n\nlabels in which version recordings are being sold by the defendants are\n\nmisleading and confusing. Mr. Lal had contended that it is for the\n\nplaintiff to determine whether the covers and labels used by the\n\ndefendant for marketing its version recordings are likely to mislead or\n\nconfuse the public as to their identity.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_163\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_164\">78.    This submission of Mr. Lal cannot be accepted. No party can be\n\na judge in his own cause. The plaintiff cannot, therefore, arrogate to\n\nitself the right to determine as to whether the covers and labels used\n\nby the defendant to market the version recordings are misleading or\n\nconfusing, and whether the said covers and labels would deceive the\n\npublic as to the identity of the product sold/hired or offered for\n\nsale/hire by the defendant. That issue can only be determined by the\n\nCourt if a grievance in that respect is raised before the Court by the\n\nplaintiff. In my view, the requirement contained in <a href=\"/doc/47493925/\" id=\"a_245\">section 52(1)(j)(ii)</a>,\n\nwhich obliges the person making the version recordings to provide\n\ncopies of covers and labels in which the sound recordings are to be\n\nsold or hired to the owners of the copyrights in the original literary,\n\ndramatic or musical works, is to enable the owners of such original\n\nrights or even the owners of copyrights in earlier recorded sound\n\nrecordings of such original literary, musical or dramatic works, to\n\nventilate their grievances before a competent court, in case the covers\n\nand labels appear to be misleading and confusing and do not\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_88\">CS(OS) Nos.1625/1999 &amp; 399/2005                               Page 56 of 76</span>\n sufficiently indicate that the product offered by the person making the\n\nversion recordings for sale/hire are his version recordings.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_165\">79.    In     its   application   being   I.A.   No.7050/1999   in    CS    (OS)\n\nNo.1625/1999, the plaintiff has made a grievance with regard to\n\nadoption of misleading and confusing labels and covers in respect of\n\nthe following titles:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_166\">\n</p><pre id=\"pre_3\">       i)       &quot;28 Super Non Stop Remix&quot; (Vol.2, 3 &amp; 4)\n\n       ii)      Rafi ke Dard Bhare Nagme\n\n       iii)     &quot;Finest Memories of Mukesh&quot;\n\n       iv)      &quot;Shradhanjali to Talat Mahmood&quot;\n\n       v)       &quot;Hits of Salman Khan&quot;\n\n       vi)      &quot;Hum Aapke Hai Kaun&quot;\n\n       vii)     Asha Remix\n\n\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_167\">              The plaintiff has also placed on record the labels and covers\n\nin which the defendant is offering for sale/hire and selling/hiring the\n\naforesaid titles which are re-mixed versions/version recordings made\n\nby the defendant.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_168\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_169\">80.    Before adverting to the said labels and covers, it would be useful\n\nto refer to three American decisions relied upon by the plaintiff in\n\nsupport of his submission. They are being referred to in chronology.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_170\">81.    The first decision is in the case of Decca Records et al v.\n\nMusicor Records et al, 166 USPQ 57 decided by the District Court,\n\nS.D. New York on 10.06.1970.          The plaintiff, Decca Records and the\n\ndefendant Musicor Records were engaged in the business of recording,\n\nproducing and distributing for sale sound recordings. In the year 1967,\n\nthe plaintiff Decca Records engaged a recording artist known as\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_89\">CS(OS) Nos.1625/1999 &amp; 399/2005                                      Page 57 of 76</span>\n Vincent Bell to make sound recordings for it under a contract.              This\n\ncontract provided that Bell will not permit anyone but Decca to use his\n\nname,    signature     and likeness in connection with the            making,\n\nadvertising    or    marketing     of   any   sound   recordings   during   the\n\ncontractual period.      Pursuant to the agreement, Bell performed and\n\nmade a sound recording of &quot;Airport Love Theme&quot;, a hit tune from a\n\nmotion picture &quot;Airport&quot;.         This recording featured Bell singly as the\n\nperforming artist. It was released, sold and distributed by Decca under\n\nthe title &quot;Airport Love Theme - Vincent Bell&quot;.          It was a commercial\n\nsuccess. Decca Records produced and distributed an album containing\n\nten selections, one of which included the Bell recording, &quot;Airport Love\n\nTheme&quot;. The nine other sound recordings were of songs also sung by\n\nBell as the feature artist.         The album cover prominently featured\n\n&quot;Airport Love Theme&quot; and below that, &quot;Vincent Bell&quot; in large letters\n\nand underneath were listed the title of the ten different records,\n\nstarting with &quot;Airport Love Theme&quot;.             This cover had a pictorial\n\nrepresentation of a girl on the deck of an airport looking beyond at an\n\nopen airfield.      The pictorial print cover had been copyrighted by the\n\nplaintiff Decca.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_171\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_172\">82.    The defendant Musicor Records announced that they plan to\n\ndistribute a ten record album with a cover containing in bold type\n\n&quot;VINCENT BELL AIRPORT&quot; and in smaller letters below, &quot;Airport Love\n\nTheme&quot;.     The album cover also contained a picture of a girl at an\n\nairport looking out at a field with planes on the ground.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_173\">83.    The plaintiff protested against the striking similarity in the album\n\ncover of the plaintiff and that sought to be adopted by the defendant.\n\nThe defendant suggested some minor changes. The changed album\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_90\">CS(OS) Nos.1625/1999 &amp; 399/2005                                     Page 58 of 76</span>\n cover contained, in addition to the same photograph as the first one,\n\nthe following: &quot;Introducing Mr. Guitar&quot; in very small letters; followed by\n\nlarge block letters, &quot;VINCENT BELL AIRPORT&quot;; below that in much\n\nsmaller letters &quot;Airport Love Theme&quot;, and; below that in a miniscule\n\ntype &quot;Performed by Giovanni Matteo&quot;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_174\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_175\">84.    The album of the defendant contained nine songs sung by Bell\n\nduring the period prior to his entering into an agreement with the\n\nplaintiff Decca Records. The tenth song, i.e. the musical composition\n\n&quot;Airport Love Theme&quot; (which was performed by Bell for the plaintiff\n\nDecca Records under an exclusive agreement), as contained in the\n\ndefendants album was not sung by Bell, but by Giovanni Matteo, whose\n\nname appeared in miniscule type of defendants revised album cover\n\nand did not appear at all in its first cover.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_176\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_177\">85.    The District Court held that it was a palpable fraud to display\n\nprominently Bell‟s name in juxtaposition to or in conjunction with\n\n&quot;Airport Love Theme&quot; in the format of the cover when, in fact, he did\n\nnot record for the defendants that song, which is included in its album,\n\nnor did he authorize its use by the defendants. The Court held that\n\nthere was substantial similarity between the plaintiff‟s album cover\n\nand that adopted by the defendant and that it would readily confuse\n\nand mislead the average purchaser into believing that the defendants‟\n\nalbum was that of the plaintiff. The Court held that the change made\n\nby the defendant was also a calculated effort by it to continue with\n\ntheir original purpose of &quot;free ride&quot; at plaintiffs‟ expense.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_178\">86.    The second decision is that of the Court of Appeal, Second Circuit\n\ntitled PPX Enterprises Inc. v. Audiofidelity Enterprises Inc., 2\n\nUSPQ2d 1672.          The plaintiff was a company, which had financial\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_91\">CS(OS) Nos.1625/1999 &amp; 399/2005                                 Page 59 of 76</span>\n interest in sale of recordings, featuring late rock musician Jimi Hendrix.\n\nThe plaintiff alleged that the defendant was marketing records\n\nfraudulently by adopting design, label and album cover to convey that\n\nthe record contains performances of Hendrix, when in fact they did\n\nnot. The plaintiff invoked the provision contained in Section 43 of the\n\nLanham Act, and also alleged tortuous interference with prospective\n\neconomic advantage by the defendant. The District Court for the\n\nSouthern District of New York granted the injunctive relief sought by\n\nthe plaintiff, but denied the claim for damages on the ground that the\n\nplaintiff/appellant had failed to provide evidence of actual consumer\n\nconfusion.    It was against the denial of claim for damages that the\n\nplaintiff preferred the aforesaid appeal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_179\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_180\">87.    The Appellate Court held that the plaintiff should not have been\n\nrequired to provide evidence of actual consumer confusion and\n\nremanded back the matter for taking further proceedings consistent\n\nwith its opinion.     In the course of its opinion, the Court of Appeal\n\nobserved that in order to state claim for injunctive relief, the plaintiff\n\nmust demonstrate the likelihood of deception or confusion on the part\n\nof the buying public caused by the false description or representation.\n\nIt further observed that a record albums cover, bearing the name and\n\nlikeness of a performer is one of the primary means of advertisement\n\nfor a record album, particularly when, in the normal retail situation a\n\ncustomer has no way of hearing the record prior to purchase. False\n\nadvertising clearly encompasses fraudulent representations that goods\n\nmarketed have ingredients or qualities that they, in fact, do not have\n\nbut that the goods of a competitor do have. It referred to an earlier\n\ndecision of American Home Products Corp. v. Johnson &amp; Johnson,\n\n577 F.2d 160, wherein it had been held that deceptive advertising or\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_92\">CS(OS) Nos.1625/1999 &amp; 399/2005                                Page 60 of 76</span>\n merchandising statements may be judged in various ways.             If a\n\nstatement is actually false, relief can be granted on the courts own\n\nfindings without reference to the reaction of the buyer or consumer of\n\nthe product.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_181\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_182\">88.    The third decision relied by learned counsel for the plaintiff is\n\nthat of the District Court, D. New Jersey in Estate of Elvis Presley v.\n\nRussen, (211 USPQ 415) decided on 16.04.1981.             In this case,\n\nRussen, the defendant produced THE BIG EL SHOW, a stage\n\nproduction. The said show closely imitated the stage shows conducted\n\nby the late Elvis Presley. The BIG EL SHOW featured an individual who\n\nimpersonates late Elvis Presley by performing in the style of Elvis\n\nPresley.

The show featured a band called the TCB\n\nBand, which was also the name of Elvis Presleys band, though the\n\nmusicians in the band of the BIG EL SHOW were different from that of\n\nthe TCB Band. The defendant Russen also produced records of THE\n\nBIG EL SHOW. One record album, entitled &quot;Viva Las Vegas&quot; had on the\n\ncover of the jacket only the title and an artist‟s sketch which upon\n\nreasonable observation appeared to be of Elvis Presley. It was only on\n\nthe back of the jacket in a short blurb and in the credits that the name\n\nBIG EL SHOW appeared. It is also indicated that the show stars Larry\n\nSeth as Big El and featured the TCB Band.        The other album was\n\nentitled BIG EL SHOW &quot;In Concert&quot; and also featured an artist‟s\n\ndrawing, ostensibly of Big El, but which looked like Elvis Presley with\n\nmicrophone in hand, singing.

The plaintiff, namely, the Estate of Elvis Presley brought action\n\nalleging infringement of copyright, trademark, violation of section 43 of\n\nthe Lanham Act, and unfair competition.

The idea generally underlying an action for a\n           right of privacy is that the individual has a right personal\n           to him to be let alone and, thus, to prevent others from\n           invading his privacy, injuring his feelings, or assaulting\n           his peace of mind. In contrast, underlying the right of\n           publicity concept is a desire to benefit from the\n           commercial exploitation of one&#x27;s name and likeness.&quot;\n\n           .........\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_121\">            &quot;Although the courts in New Jersey have not used the\n           term &quot;right of publicity,&quot; they have recognized and\n           supported an individual&#x27;s right to prevent the\n           unauthorized, commercial appropriation of his name or\n           likeness.

In granting the\n           requested relief, the court concluded that:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_122\">              If a man&#x27;s name be his own property, as no less\n              an authority than the United States Supreme\n              Court says it is ... it is difficult to understand why\n              the peculiar cast of one&#x27;s features is not also one&#x27;s\n              property, and why its pecuniary value, if it has\n              one, does not belong to its owner rather than to\n              the person seeking to make an unauthorized use\n              of it.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_123\">       Id. at 141.

Judge Lynch in his thoughtful\n       opinion in Canessa initially found that &quot;in the concept of\n       &#x27;right of privacy&#x27; there is implicit the right of property, at\n       least in the instance of an appropriation by defendant of\n       another&#x27;s likeness.&quot; 97 N.J.Super. at 339, 235 A.2d 62. After\n       a comprehensive examination of a number of cases\n       occurring prior to Canessa, Judge Lynch decided that:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_126\">       Entirely apart, however, from the metaphysical niceties, the\n       reality of a case such as we have here is, in the court&#x27;s\n       opinion, simply this: plaintiffs&#x27; names and likenesses belong\n       to them. As such they are property. They are things of value.\n       Defendant has made them so, for it has taken them for its\n       own commercial benefit.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_127\">       New Jersey has always enjoined the use of plaintiff&#x27;s likeness\n       and name on the specific basis that it was a protected\n       property right.

In addition, this right, having been\n       characterized by New Jersey courts as a property right,\n       rather than as a right personal to and attached to the\n       individual, is capable of being disassociated from the\n       individual and transferred by him for commercial purposes.\n       We thus determine that during his life Elvis Presley owned a\n       property right in his name and likeness which he could\n       license or assign for his commercial benefit.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_189\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_190\">91.    The Court held, prima facie, in favour of the plaintiff on its right\n\nof publicity claim with respect to the defendants live stage production\n\nand the defendants unauthorized use of Elvis Presley likeness on the\n\ncover or label of any records which were sold or distributed by the\n\ndefendants. It was also held that after the death of Elvis Presley, the\n\nrights to use the service mark and trade mark identifying the\n\nentertainment services of Elvis Presley and the merchandise licensed\n\nby him passed to Presley‟s legal representatives as a part of its Estate.\n\nThe Court then examined the issue whether the consumers viewing the\n\ndefendants‟ marks were likely to believe that plaintiff sponsored THE\n\nBIG EL SHOW production or licensed the defendants to use the mark in\n\nconnection with the show or was in some other way associated or\n\naffiliated with the production. In this regard, the Court examined the\n\naspects: the strength of the plaintiffs mark; similarity of the marks;\n\ndefendants‟ intent; similarity of services; similarity of challenges of\n\ntrade, manners of marketing predominant purchasers; actual confusion\n\nand likelihood of confusion. It was held that in determining the\n\nexistence of likelihood of confusion, the Court must look through the\n\neye of ordinary purchasers buying with ordinary caution.        The Court\n\nobserved as follows:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_191\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_96\">CS(OS) Nos.1625/1999 &amp; 399/2005                                 Page 64 of 76</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_129\">        &quot;In making our decision, it is not necessary to conclude that\n       the public be led to believe that defendant&#x27;s show is\n       composed of actual Elvis Presley performances or is\n       produced by the plaintiff. It is not even necessary that the\n       public know who the plaintiff is. What is required and what\n       we find is that the ordinary purchaser generally familiar with\n       plaintiff&#x27;s marks is likely to believe that defendant&#x27;s show is\n       somehow related to, associated with, or sponsored by the\n       same people or entity that provides the actual Elvis Presley\n       entertainment services identified by its own marks. It is not\n       at all unreasonable for the public to believe that this entity,\n       which is the plaintiff, the Estate of Elvis Presley, has decided\n       to license or sponsor a form of entertainment closely related\n       to its other entertainment services. The public, realizing that\n       an actual Elvis Presley live stage show is now impossible,\n       might assume that the plaintiff&#x27;s only alternative in order to\n       enter this specific area of the entertainment field was to\n       produce or sponsor an imitation of a real Elvis Presley\n       performance, perhaps by using members of the actual\n       Presley performing troupe or production staff or by\n       supplying costumes or other official Presley items. It is also\n       highly possible that consumers seeing the defendant&#x27;s TCB\n       logo or the advertisements highlighting the likeness of Elvis\n       Presley might believe that the show is a multimedia\n       presentation and incorporates films or recordings of actual\n       Elvis Presley performances.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_130\">           Our decisions with respect to the name THE BIG EL\n       SHOW alone and in association with any pictures or artist&#x27;s\n       renderings resembling the &quot;Elvis Pose&quot; are closer. After\n       careful consideration of the various factors, we have\n       concluded that the use of the name THE BIG EL SHOW by\n       itself does not create a likelihood of confusion, but its use as\n       part of the logo or in connection with misleading pictures\n       does create such confusion.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_131\">           By attaching the artist&#x27;s rendering to the name THE BIG\n       EL SHOW to form the logo, the defendant has gone beyond\n       allowable bounds. The likelihood of confusion associated\n       with the artist&#x27;s rendering is not sufficiently diminished by\n       the use of the name with it. The picture, which certainly\n       appears to be of Elvis Presley, provides the major triggering\n       mechanism for the appeal to the public. The purchasing\n       public seeing the picture and the name is likely to have a\n       very similar reaction to the logo, believing the picture to be\n       of Elvis, as it would if the picture were presented alone. The\n       addition of the name may help to confirm that the\n       production is an imitation of an actual Presley performance,\n       but it really does not dispel any confusion as to plaintiff&#x27;s\n       association with or sponsorship of the production.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_132\">          Thus, based on the current state of the record, we have\n       found a likelihood of confusion with respect to the\n       defendant&#x27;s marks of TCB with or without the lightning bolt,\n       any artist&#x27;s renderings or pictures which resemble the &quot;Elvis\n       Pose,&quot; and the logo. The plaintiff has established the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_97\">CS(OS) Nos.1625/1999 &amp; 399/2005                                 Page 65 of 76</span>\n        likelihood of its ultimate success on the merits of its\n       infringement claims as to these marks. The plaintiff has not\n       established the same likelihood as to the defendant&#x27;s use of\n       THE BIG EL SHOW, alone, as the name or mark for its\n       production.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_192\">92.    The Court also held that the use by the defendant of THE BIG EL\n\nSHOW logo (words and Presley likeness), the pictures resembling\n\nPresley, and the initials TCB in the defendants advertising and business\n\nand promotional materials were likely to deceive the public as to the\n\norigin or sponsorship of the show itself. The Court however held that\n\nthe defendants use of the name THE BIG EL SHOW, without any\n\naccompanying photographs or artists renderings was not likely to\n\ncause confusion or deception.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_193\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_194\">93.    Learned counsel for the plaintiff has drawn my attention to the\n\nlabels and covers in respect of the aforesaid package, wherein the\n\nversion recordings had been marketed by the defendant. In none of\n\nthe labels and covers, the defendant appears to have prominently\n\nstated that the recordings being marketed are not from the original\n\nsound track. While in some of the labels and covers, it is so printed,\n\nthe size of the print is miniscule when compared to other materials\n\nprinted on the labels and covers. For example, the cover of &quot;28 Super\n\nNon Stop Remix (Vol.2)&quot; does not contain any statement as to whether\n\nthe recordings sold under the said cover are from the original sound\n\ntrack or not. In the recordings sold under the cover &quot;28 Super Non\n\nStop Remix (Vol.4)&quot;, the defendant in small print states &quot;From the\n\noriginal film sound track&quot;. In even smaller print, the defendant records\n\n&quot;Recorded as per provision of <a href=\"/doc/1013176/\" id=\"a_247\">section 52</a> of the Copyright Act, 1957&quot;\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_133\">and &quot;Not from the original film sound track&quot;.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_98\">CS(OS) Nos.1625/1999 &amp; 399/2005                              Page 66 of 76</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_195\"> 94.    In the title, &quot;28 Super Non Stop Remix of latest film hits (Vol.2)&quot;,\n\nthe names of the artists who have recorded the version recordings\n\nhave also been displayed in a small print compared to the other\n\nprominent materials printed on the cover which included photographs\n\nof film stars.    Same is the position in the title &quot;28 Super Non Stop\n\nRemix (Vol.4)&quot;. In the title, &quot;28 Super Non Stop Remix of latest film\n\nhits (Vol.3)&quot;, the names of the singers are mentioned with a little more\n\nprominence than the first two covers, discussed above.           However,\n\nthere is no disclosure expressly stating that the sound recordings are\n\nnot from the original sound track and are version recordings and this\n\ncover as well, in miniscule print, states &quot;Recorded as per provisions of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1013176/\" id=\"a_248\">Section 52</a> of the Copyright Act, 1957&quot;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_196\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_197\">95.    In my view, it is not enough for the defendant to state that the\n\nrecordings are recorded as per provision of <a href=\"/doc/1013176/\" id=\"a_249\">section 52</a> of the Copyright\n\nAct. By reading the said inscription, a lay person cannot be expected\n\nto understand that the recordings are version recordings, and not from\n\nthe original sound track. For the unsuspecting consumer, it is\n\nimportant to know that what he has been offered for sale or hire is a\n\nversion recording and not a recording from the original sound track.\n\nAfter all, it is the recording made from the original sound track which,\n\nin the first place, would have been distributed to the public at large for\n\nconsumption, and it is the recording from the original sound track\n\nwhich, normally, would make the recording popular to attract buyers\n\nand customers.        A customer may want to acquire a recording as\n\ncontained in the original sound track.     He may not be interested in\n\nacquiring a version recording of the same song. The mere disclosure\n\nof the names of the singers in the version recordings by itself is also\n\nnot sufficient, even if made with some prominence, for the reason that\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_99\">CS(OS) Nos.1625/1999 &amp; 399/2005                                 Page 67 of 76</span>\n the lay person who may be offered the version recording for sale/hire\n\nmay not be even aware of the fact that the originally made recording,\n\nwhich he may have heard as a part of the cinematograph film in the\n\nfirst 2-3 years of the recording being released, was sung by some other\n\nartists and not by the artists whose names are contained on the cover\n\nof the version recording. The use of the word &quot;remix&quot; by itself also\n\ndoes not lead to the conclusion that the recording being offered for\n\nsale/hire under a cover is not from the original sound track as it is\n\npossible to use the song as sung by the artist on the original sound\n\ntrack, while adding to or altering the background music from that\n\ncontained in the original sound track.   What is essential is that the\n\ncustomer should be able to make an informed and a conscious choice.\n\nHe should know, when he buys/hires the sound recording that it is a\n\nversion recording of the same composition (music and/or lyrics) that he\n\nmay have earlier heard. It may be, that to him, the version recording\n\nis just or acceptable. This may be due to various reasons. The version\n\nrecording may, in his judgment, be as good or even better than the\n\noriginally made sound recording or it may be more affordable. There\n\ncould be other reasons as well. But it should not happen that he is\n\nmisled into buying or hiring a version recording by deception due to\n\nthe use of a deceptive or confusing label or cover by the person\n\nmarketing the version recording.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_198\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_199\">96.    I may now turn to another set of labels and covers in question.\n\nThese are the labels and covers, where under the defendant is stated\n\nto be offering for sale/hire its version recordings of songs originally\n\nsung by a particular artist such as Mukesh, Asha Bhosle, Mohammed\n\nRafi and Talat Mahmood. In the covers, the defendant has displayed\n\nthe pictures of Mukesh, Asha Bhosle, Mohammed Rafi and Talat\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_100\">CS(OS) Nos.1625/1999 &amp; 399/2005                             Page 68 of 76</span>\n Mahmood respectively. The titles of the various songs of which version\n\nrecordings are contained in the audio compact disks marketed by the\n\ndefendant are also enlisted with prominence. Once again, one finds\n\nthat the words &quot;Recorded as per provision of <a href=\"/doc/1013176/\" id=\"a_250\">section 52</a> of the\n\nCopyright Act, 1957&quot; and the words &quot;Not from the original sound\n\ntrack&quot; are recorded in miniscule print compared to the other materials\n\nprinted on the cover. In the title &quot;Shradhanjali to Talat Mahmood&quot;, the\n\ndefendant has recorded &quot;The renderings incorporated in the cassettes\n\nare not renderings of the original artists but of some others whose\n\nnames are mentioned on the inlay card&quot;. Even this notification is in\n\nminiscule print when compared to the other printed material.\n\nPertinently, in the title &quot;Gulshan Kumar presents the finest moments of\n\nMukesh&quot;, the names of the artists who have recorded the version\n\nrecordings do not appear to have been disclosed at all.       There is,\n\ntherefore, every likelihood of confusion in the mind of an unsuspecting\n\ncustomer into believing that the recordings being sold under the said\n\ncover are from the original sound track as sung by the artist Mukesh.\n\nThe position in the titles of &quot;Shradhanjali to Talat Mahmood&quot; and\n\n&quot;Gulshan Kumar present Asha Bhosle Remix&quot; is slightly different. The\n\nnames of the singers have been displayed with some prominence. In\n\nthe version recording being sold with the title &quot;Rafi ke Dard Bhare\n\nNagme - Patter ke Sanam&quot;, the name of the singer Sonu Nigam is\n\nprominently displayed alongwith his photograph.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_200\">97.    Apart from these, the learned counsel for the plaintiff has drawn\n\nmy attention to the title &quot;Hits of Salman Khan&quot;, under which the\n\ndefendant has been marketing the version recordings of various films\n\nsongs featuring the actor Salman Khan. On the cover, the picture of\n\nSalman Khan, the actor is prominently displayed. The title of the songs\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_101\">CS(OS) Nos.1625/1999 &amp; 399/2005                              Page 69 of 76</span>\n of which version recordings are contained in the VCD are also\n\nprominently displayed.            Pertinently, the cover also contains the\n\ndeclaration, though in smaller print, &quot;From the original film sound\n\ntrack. Original T-Series recording. Recorded as per provisions of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1013176/\" id=\"a_251\">section 52</a> of the Copyright Act, 1957. Not from the original film sound\n\ntrack&quot;. It, therefore, appears that the said cover contains contradictory\n\nand misleading statements. While on the one hand it is stated that the\n\nrecordings are from the original film sound track, in the same breadth,\n\nit is also stated that the recordings are not from the original film sound\n\ntrack.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_201\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_202\">98.      In my view, apart from the covers with the title &quot;Asha Bhosle\n\nRemix&quot; and &quot;Rafi ke Dard Bhare Nagme - Patter ke Sanam&quot;, which\n\nprominently display the names of the singers who have recorded the\n\nversion recordings originally sung by Asha Bhosle and Mohammed Rafi\n\nrespectively, and therefore, do not leave much room for confusion in\n\nthe mind of the unsuspecting purchaser, all other covers, as discussed\n\nabove, in which the defendant is marketing its version recordings, are\n\nthoroughly misleading and confusing.          To me, it appears that it is a\n\ndeliberate attempt on the part of the defendant to ride on the\n\npopularity of the original recordings as contained in the original sound\n\ntrack, by suppressing the fact that the defendants covers contained\n\nonly version recordings and not recordings from the original sound\n\ntrack. In fact, the defendant has repeatedly made false statements by\n\nclaiming that the Audio CDs contained recordings from the original\n\nsound track, as I have already noticed above.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_203\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_204\">99.      The decisions relied upon by the plaintiff of the American Courts\n\nin Decca Records et al v. Musicor Records et al, 166 USPQ 57\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_102\">CS(OS) Nos.1625/1999 &amp; 399/2005                                   Page 70 of 76</span>\n and PPX Enterprises Inc. v. Audiofidelity Enterprises Inc.,\n\nreported as 2 USPQ2d 1672, which appeal to me, would apply in the\n\nfacts of the present case as well. So far as the decision in Estate of\n\nElvis Presley v. Russen, (211 USPQ 415) is concerned, the only\n\ndistinction in that case was that it was the Estate of Elvis Presley, who\n\nwas the plaintiff, whereas in the present case, it is not that the estate\n\nor the successor in interest of Mukesh or Talat Mahmood have\n\napproached the Court, and it is also not the case where Asha Bhosle\n\nhas approached the Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_205\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_206\">100. The plaintiff has apparently acquired the copyright in the literary,\n\ndramatic and musical work from the original copyright owner.             That\n\nwould not, by itself, entitle the plaintiff to seek a restraint against the\n\ndefendant from displaying the pictures of artists such as Mukesh, Talat\n\nMahmood, Mohammed Rafi and Asha Bhosle. If such a grievance is to\n\nbe     made,     it   would       be   for   the   concerned   persons/their\n\nestate/representatives to initiate appropriate action.         However, the\n\ndecision in Elvis Presley (supra) otherwise appeals to me, and in the\n\nlight of the said decisions, I am inclined to injunct the defendant from\n\nmarketing its version recordings in the covers placed on record with\n\nthe following titles:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_207\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_134\">     i) &quot;28 Super Non Stop Remix&quot; (Vol.2, 3 &amp; 4)\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_135\">     ii) &quot;Finest Memories of Mukesh&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_136\">     iii) &quot;Shradhanjali to Talat Mahmood&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_208\">     iv) &quot;Hits of Salman Khan&quot;\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_137\">     v) &quot;Hum Aapke Hai Kaun&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_209\">     However, I may clarify that it shall be open to the defendant to\n\nmarket it version recordings under labels and covers, which do not\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_103\">CS(OS) Nos.1625/1999 &amp; 399/2005                                   Page 71 of 76</span>\n deceive or confuse the unsuspecting customer with regard to the fact\n\nthat they are version recordings and not recordings from the original\n\nsound track.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_210\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_211\">101.      I now turn to the submission of Mr. Lal that the action of the\n\ndefendant in using its sound recording to produce a cinematograph\n\nfilm constitutes infringement of the plaintiffs copyright in the original\n\nliterary, dramatic and musical works.             It is submitted that the\n\ndefendant combined the version recording produced by it with moving\n\nimages which resulted in the production of the cinematograph film.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_212\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"331232\" id=\"span_104\">102.      It   is   clear   from   a   bare   reading   of   the   definition   of\n\ncinematograph film as contained in <a href=\"/doc/141918630/\" id=\"a_252\">Section 2(f)</a> of the Copyright Act\n\nand also from a reading of the judgment of the Supreme Court in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/331232/\" id=\"a_253\">Indian Performing Right Society Limited v. Eastern Indian\n\nMotion Picture Association &amp; Others</a>, AIR 1977 SC 1443, that the\n\nterm &quot;cinematograph film&quot; includes a sound track associated with the\n\nfilm.   A &quot;cinematograph film&quot; is to be taken to include the sounds\n\nembodied in a sound track which are associated with the film. It was\n\nheld by the Supreme Court in this decision that if an author (composer)\n\nof lyrics or musical works authorizes a cinematograph film producer to\n\nmake a cinematograph film using his composition by recording it on\n\nthe sound track of a cinematograph film, he cannot complain of the\n\ninfringement of his copyright if the producer of the cinematograph film\n\ncauses such lyrics or musical work recorded on the sound track of the\n\nfilm to be heard in public. It was further held that the composer of lyric\n\nor a musical work, however, retains the right of performing it in public\n\nfor profit otherwise than as a part of the cinematograph film and he\n\ncannot be restrained from doing so. Therefore, it follows that even in a\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_105\">CS(OS) Nos.1625/1999 &amp; 399/2005                                       Page 72 of 76</span>\n case where the author of the literary, dramatic or musical work has\n\nauthorized the making of a cinematograph film, which embodies a\n\nsound track in it, the producer of the cinematograph film gets only a\n\nlimited right to exploit the sound track of the cinematograph film.\n\nThis, however, does not mean that where an author of a literary,\n\ndramatic or musical work has authorized the making of a sound\n\nrecording of his work, the person making the authorized sound\n\nrecording or even a person making a version recording by resort to\n\n<a href=\"/doc/47493925/\" id=\"a_254\">Section 52(1)(j)</a> of the Act, would be entitled to exploit the said sound\n\nrecording or the version recording for the purpose of making a\n\ncinematograph film.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_213\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_214\">103.       The only protection against infringement granted by <a href=\"/doc/1013176/\" id=\"a_255\">Section\n\n52</a> in respect of the making of a cinematograph film is contained in\n\nClause (u) of <a href=\"/doc/257434/\" id=\"a_256\">Section 52 (1)</a>. The said provision reads as follows:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_138\">              &quot;52(1). The following acts shall not constitute\n              an infringement of copyright, namely:--\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_139\">              (a)    .... .... ....\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_140\">                     ... .... ....\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_141\">              (u)    the inclusion in a cinematograph film of -\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_142\">                     (i)   any artistic work permanently\n                     situate in a public place or any premises\n                     to which the public has access; or\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_143\">                     (ii)  any other artistic work, if such\n                     inclusion is only by way of background or\n                     is otherwise incidental to the principal\n                     matters represented in the film&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_144\">104.       What does not constitute infringement of copyright in the\n\ncourse of making a cinematograph film is the inclusion in the\n\ncinematograph film of an artistic work which is permanently situated in\n\na public place or in premises to which the public has access, or the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_106\">CS(OS) Nos.1625/1999 &amp; 399/2005                                   Page 73 of 76</span>\n inclusion in the cinematograph film of any other artistic work, if such\n\ninclusion is only by way of background, or is otherwise incidental to the\n\nprincipal matters represented in the film.           Pertinently, literary,\n\ndramatic or musical works or the sound recordings made in respect\n\nthereof cannot be incorporated in a cinematograph film without prior\n\nlicence or consent from the owners of such works, as there is no saving\n\nclause in <a href=\"/doc/1013176/\" id=\"a_257\">Section 52</a> in respect of such works being utilized in the\n\nmaking of a cinematograph film.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_145\">105. VCDs and DVDs would fall within the definition of the expression\n\n&quot;cinematograph film&quot; defined in <a href=\"/doc/141918630/\" id=\"a_258\">Section 2 (f)</a> of the Act, as recording\n\nmade on a VCD/DVD is a visual recording from which moving images\n\nare produced. Copyright conferred on the owner of a copyright in a\n\nsound recording by virtue of <a href=\"/doc/60721279/\" id=\"a_259\">Section 14 (e)</a> does not specifically include\n\nthe right to make a cinematograph film embodying the sound\n\nrecording.    In contradistinction, it, inter alia, gives him the exclusive\n\nright to make any other sound recording embodying it.            The right\n\nconferred on the owner of a copyright in a sound recording to\n\ncommunicate the sound recording to the public can only mean the\n\nright to communicate the sound recording as a sound recording.             It\n\ncannot mean the right to communicate the sound recording as a part\n\nof, or as embodied in a cinematograph film. On the other hand, the\n\nright to utilize the literary, dramatic or musical work to make a\n\ncinematograph film is specifically conferred on the owner of the\n\ncopyright in the literary, dramatic or musical work by virtue of <a href=\"/doc/82279299/\" id=\"a_260\">Section\n\n14 (a) (iv)</a> of the Act. The said right being an exclusive right cannot\n\npossibly inhere at the same time in two persons namely the owner of\n\nthe copyright in the literary, dramatic or musical work and the owner of\n\nthe copyright in the sound recording.       Therefore, the owner of the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_107\">CS(OS) Nos.1625/1999 &amp; 399/2005                                 Page 74 of 76</span>\n copyright in a sound recording cannot proceed to incorporate the\n\nsound recording/version recording in a cinematograph film without the\n\nexpress licence from the owners of the copyright in the literary,\n\ndramatic or musical works from which the sound recording is made.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_146\">106.          Therefore,   the    argument   of   the   plaintiff   that   version\n\nrecordings made by resort to <a href=\"/doc/47493925/\" id=\"a_261\">Section 52(1)(j)</a> cannot be incorporated in\n\na cinematograph film, without the express consent/licence from the\n\nowner(s) of the copyright(s) in the original, literary, dramatic or\n\nmusical work which were used for making the sound recording, is\n\naccepted. Consequently, the plaintiff is justified in seeking an\n\ninjunction against the defendant in so far as the defendant has\n\npurported to utilize the literary, dramatic and musical works of the\n\nplaintiff for making of VCDs/DVDs which are cinematograph films.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_147\">107.
