The ultrasound report has been\n\n        brought on record as Annexure-1. The victim was also examined by\n\n        Dr. Rakesh Kumar, Consultant, Neuro-Psychiatrist, on 28.01.2017\n\n        who noticed abnormal behavior and wondering tendency and\n\n        prescribed certain medicines which gets reflected from the medical\n Patna High Court CWJC No.5286 of 2017 dt.26-04-2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                        4/27</span>\n\n\n\n\n        prescription, as contained in Annexure-2.

It is stated in\n\n        paragraph no.9 of the petition that the victim was taken to PMCH on\n\n        03.04.2017 when she was found HIV +ve.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_2\">                          For the first time, on 14.03.2017, the victim disclosed\n\n        that she was subjected to forceful physical relationship and the\n\n        pregnancy she is carrying is outcome of such forceful relationship, but\n\n        she failed to disclose about this incident to anybody. After\n\n        14.03.2017, the victim expressed her willingness to the management\n\n        of the NGO, for getting the pregnancy terminated. Initially she was\n\n        not very coherent, but after some time she disclosed the incident,\n\n        leading to registration of Patna Mahila P.S.

Thereafter, the present writ\n\n        application was filed on 07.04.2017.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_3\">                          On 10.04.2017, for the first time the matter was taken\n\n        up, when this Court permitted the counsel for the victim to implead\n\n        the husband and father of the victim, Sr. S.P., Patna and Director of\n\n        IGIMS as party respondents. Since Kaushal Kumar Jha, learned\n\n        AAG-8 was representing Sr. S.P., Patna and Mr. Sunil Kumar,\n\n        Advocates was representing the Director, IGIMS, Patna, hence notices\n\n        were not issued to them, though, notices were issued to respondent\n\n        nos. 7 and 8. Respondent no.4, the Superintendent, Shanti Kutir,\n\n        Woman Rehabilitation Centre, appearing in person, was advised to\n\n        file counter affidavit. Similarly learned A.A.G.-8 was directed to file\n\n        counter affidavit on behalf of respondent nos. 1, 2 and 9, the State of\n\n        Bihar, Sr. S.P., Patna and Superintendent, PMCH, respectively. The\n\n        Sr. S.P., Patna was directed to submit an interim report by 17.04.2017\n\n        with regard to the progress in investigation of Patna Mahila P.S. Case\n\n        No. 13 of 2017, as also with regard to the time frame in which the\n\n        investigation is likely to be concluded. The Director, IGIMS, Patna\n\n        was directed to constitute Multi Disciplinary Medical Board\n\n        consisting of Head of the Department of Gynecology, Head of the\n\n        Department of Neurology, Head of the Department of Forensic\n\n        Medicine, In charge, Antiretroviral Therapy Centre or any Doctor of\n Patna High Court CWJC No.5286 of 2017 dt.26-04-2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                        6/27</span>\n\n\n\n\n        such discipline. The Director, IGIMS was given further liberty to\n\n        nominate one or more Doctors as Members of Multi Disciplinary\n\n        Board. It was recorded in the order that it is expected from the said\n\n        Medical Board to examine the victim with regard to her present\n\n        physical and mental state, which includes stage of pregnancy, overall\n\n        condition of foetus, how far the termination of pregnancy will be\n\n        detrimental to the victim and if the petitioner is allowed to complete\n\n        the full course of pregnancy then how far it will be detrimental to the\n\n        petitioner and the foetus, particularly in view of the earlier medical\n\n        report suggesting the petitioner being mentally abrased and HIV +ve\n\n        or whether it will be medically safe to allow her to complete the full\n\n        term of pregnancy and give birth to a baby. The petitioner was\n\n        directed to make herself present before the Director, IGIMS on\n\n        11.04.2017 at 10.30 AM and thereafter the Director, IGIMS, Patna\n\n        was given liberty to fix further time schedule for getting her medically\n\n        examined. The Director, IGIMS, Patna was directed to submit a\n\n        comprehensive report to this Court on 17.04.2017 at 10.30 AM. On\n\n        17.04.2017, the medical report was submitted on behalf of respondent\n\n        no.4 in a sealed cover and the matter was passed over to enable the\n\n        counsels for the parties to go through the medical report. On\n\n        18.04.2017 it was pointed out that counsel for the petitioner has made\n\n        Vineet Sharma as party respondent as husband of the victim whereas\n\n        the name of the husband of the victim is Vinod Sharma, in the\n Patna High Court CWJC No.5286 of 2017 dt.26-04-2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                        7/27</span>\n\n\n\n\n        circumstances, counsel for the petitioner is permitted to make Dasti\n\n        service of notice to the respondent nos.7 and 8 through the Officer In-\n\n        Charge of local police station and the matter was fixed for\n\n        20.04.2017, but on 20.04.2017 since the matter could not be listed on\n\n        the top of the cause list it was taken up on 21.04.2017, when the\n\n        counsels appearing for respondent nos. 7 and 8 prayed for some\n\n        accommodation to file counter affidavit, as a result the matter was\n\n        again adjourned.

The Superintendent\n\n        of Rehabilitation Center on 18.03.2017 represented to the respondent\n\n        no.2, i.e., the Superintendent, PMCH for termination of pregnancy of\n\n        the victim, which was of 17 weeks. Learned counsel for the petitioner\n\n        thus submits that the victim should be permitted to get the pregnancy\n\n        terminated, since the delay has been caused due to inaction of hospital\n\n        authorities and now the pregnancy is of 24 weeks, as per the medical\n\n        report of PMCH, while it is of 21 to 22 weeks as per report of Medical\n\n        Board.

Moreover, the\n\n        termination, as contemplated under <a href=\"/doc/642477/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 3</a> of the Act, 1971, is only\n\n        permissible up to 20 weeks of pregnancy. Definitely the effort for\n\n        termination was made on behalf of the victim in the 17th week of\n\n        pregnancy, but the present writ application has been filed before this\n\n        Court after 20 weeks of her pregnancy.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_31\">                  The explanation to <a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 3</a> of the Act stipulates the\n\n        termination of pregnancy, when the same is result of rape or failure of\n\n        birth control method, since both the eventualities have been equated\n\n        with grave injury to the mental health of the woman.

Hence, in view of report of Medical Board, this Court\n\n        finds that the victim‟s actual reasonable foreseeable environment\n\n        would be less risky in allowing the continuation of pregnancy to its\n\n        full term.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_33\">                  <a href=\"/doc/47920/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 4</a> deals with the place where the pregnancy may be\n\n        terminated. This Court is not dealing with <a href=\"/doc/47920/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 4</a> since the dispute\n\n        in the present case is not with regard to place of termination of\n\n        pregnancy. <a href=\"/doc/1891528/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 5</a> of the Act permits a registered medical\n\n        practitioner to proceed with the termination of pregnancy when he/she\n\n        forms opinion in good faith that the termination of such pregnancy is\n\n        immediately necessary to save the life of the pregnant woman.

The\n                         legislative intent was to provide a qualified „right to\n                         abortion‟ and the termination of pregnancy has never\n                         been recognized as a normal recourse for expecting\n                         mothers.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">                              22. There is no doubt that a woman‟s right to make\n                         reproductive choices is also a dimension of „personal\n                         liberty‟ as understood under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_38\">Article 21</a> of the\n                         Constitution of India. It is important to recognize that\n                         reproductive choices can be exercised to procreate as\n                         well as to abstain from procreating. The crucial\n                         consideration is that a woman‟s right to privacy,\n                         dignity and bodily integrity should be respected. This\n                         means that there should be no restriction whatsoever on\n                         the exercise of reproductive choices such as a woman‟s\n                         right to refuse participation in sexual activity or\n                         alternatively the insistence on use of contraceptive\n                         methods. Furthermore, women are also free to choose\n                         birth-control methods such as undergoing sterilization\n                         procedures.       Taken      to   their   logical   conclusion,\n                         reproductive rights include a woman‟s entitlement to\n                         carry a pregnancy to its full term, to give birth and to\n                         subsequently raise children. However, in the case of\n                         pregnant women there is also a „compelling State\n                         interest‟ in protecting the life of the prospective child.\n                         Therefore, the termination of a pregnancy is only\n                         permitted when the conditions specified in the\n Patna High Court CWJC No.5286 of 2017 dt.26-04-2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">                                        23/27</span>\n\n\n\n\n                         applicable statute have been fulfilled. Hence, the\n                         provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_39\">MTP Act, 1971</a> can also be viewed as\n                         reasonable restrictions that have been placed on the\n                         exercise of reproductive choices.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\">                          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1500783\" id=\"span_26\">So far as mental retardation of the victim is concerned,\n\n        from the report of Medical Board, it appears that the mental\n\n        retardation of the victim is of a very mild nature, whereas in the case\n\n        of <a href=\"/doc/1500783/\" id=\"a_40\">Suchita Srivastava</a> (supra) also, the victim was suffering from „mild\n\n        mental retardation‟, with regard to which it was held that it does not\n\n        mean that she is entirely incapable of making decisions for herself.\n\n        Even the Apex Court was of the opinion that the language of the <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_41\">MTP\n\n        Act</a> clearly respects the personal autonomy of mentally retarded\n\n        persons who are above the age of majority and keeping in mind the\n\n        willingness of the victim to carry on the pregnancy, the Apex Court\n\n        had set aside the judgment and order dated 09.06.2009 and\n\n        17.07.2009 of Punjab &amp; Haryana High Court. Though, the High Court\n\n        in Suchita Srivastava‟s case (supra) has invoked the doctrine of\n\n        Parens Patriae while exercising its writ jurisdiction to go beyond the\n\n        literal interpretation of the statute and adopted a purposive approach\n\n        and by arriving at a conclusion that the termination of pregnancy\n\n        would serve the best interests of the victim. The Apex Court while\n\n        dealing with the doctrine of Parens Patriae has recorded that the said\n\n        doctrine has been evolved in common law and is applied in situations\n\n        where the state must make decisions in order to protect the interests of\n Patna High Court CWJC No.5286 of 2017 dt.26-04-2017\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">                                        24/27</span>\n\n\n\n\n        those persons who are unable to take care of themselves. For\n\n        exercising such jurisdiction, two distinct standards are commonly\n\n        used. These two standards are the „best interests‟ test and the\n\n        „substituted judgment‟ test. The „best interests‟ test requires the court\n\n        to ascertain the course of action which would serve the best interests\n\n        of the person in question. In such a situation, the court must undertake\n\n        a careful inquiry of the medical opinion on the feasibility of the\n\n        pregnancy as well as social circumstances faced by the victim.</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_40\">                          In the present case also, in the „best interest‟ of the\n\n        victim and the foetus, this Court finds no reason to exercise the\n\n        jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_42\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India for directing\n\n        the pregnancy to be terminated in its 23-24 week, particularly such\n\n        termination of pregnancy, as per the Medical Board report would be\n\n        hazardous to the life of the victim.
