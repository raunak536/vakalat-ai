Right to life enshrined in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_2\">Article 21</a> is not of mere survival or\n\n   existence. It guarantees a right of person to life with human dignity.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_2\">   Therein are included, all the aspects of life which go to make a person&#x27;s life\n\n   meaningful, complete and worth living. The human life has its charm and\n\n   there is no reason why the life should not be enjoyed along with all\n\n   permissible pleasures. Anyone who wishes to live in peace, comfort and\n\n   quiet within his house has a right to prevent the noise as pollutant\n\n   reaching him. No one can claim a right to create noise even in his own\n\n   premises which would travel beyond his precincts and cause nuisance to\n\n   neighbours or others. Any noise which has the effect of materially\n\n   interfering with the ordinary comforts of life judged by the standard of a\n\n   reasonable man is nuisance. How and when a nuisance created by noise\n\n   becomes actionable has to be answered by reference to its degree and the\n\n   surrounding circumstances including the place and the time. Those who\n\n   make noise often take shelter behind <a href=\"/doc/1142233/\" id=\"a_3\">Article 19(1)</a>a pleading freedom of\n\n   speech and right to expression. Undoubtedly, the freedom of speech and\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                       1</span>\n    right to expression are fundamental rights but the rights are not absolute.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_3\">   Nobody can claim a fundamental right to create noise by amplifying the\n\n   sound of his speech with the help of loudspeakers. While one has a right to\n\n   speech, others have a right to listen or decline to listen. Nobody can be\n\n   compelled to listen and nobody can claim that he has a right to make his\n\n   voice trespass into the ears or mind of others. Nobody can indulge into\n\n   aural aggression. If anyone increases his volume of speech and that too\n\n   with the assistance of artificial devices so as to compulsorily expose\n\n   unwilling persons to hear a noise raised to unpleasant or obnoxious levels\n\n   then the person speaking is violating the right of others to a peaceful,\n\n   comfortable   and   pollution-free     life   guaranteed    by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_4\">Article   21.</a> <a href=\"/doc/1142233/\" id=\"a_5\">Article\n\n   19(1)</a>a cannot be pressed into service for defeating the fundamental right\n\n   guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_6\">Article 21.</a> We need not further dwell on this aspect. Two\n\n   decisions in this regard delivered by High Courts have been brought to our\n\n   notice wherein the right to live in an atmosphere free from noise pollution\n\n   has been upheld as the one guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_7\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">   These decisions are Free Legal Aid Cell Shri Sugan Chand Aggarwal alias\n\n   Bhagatji v.

The\n\nGovernment of India participated in the Conference and\n\nstrongly voiced the environmental concerns. While several\n\nmeasures have been taken for environmental protection both\n\nbefore and after the Conference, the need for a general\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                              5</span>\n legislation   further   to   implement    the   decisions     of   the\n\nConference has become increasingly evident.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">2. Although there are existing laws dealing directly or\n\nindirectly with several environmental matters, it is necessary\n\nto have a general legislation for environmental protection.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_19\">Existing laws generally focus on specific types of pollution or\n\non specific categories of hazardous substances. Some major\n\nareas of environmental hazards are not covered. There also\n\nexist uncovered gaps in areas of major environmental\n\nhazards. There are inadequate linkages in handling matters\n\nof industrial and environmental safety. Control mechanisms\n\nto guard against slow, insidious build up of hazardous\n\nsubstances especially new chemicals in the environment, are\n\nweak. Because of a multiplicity of regulatory agencies, there\n\nis need for an authority which can assume the lead role for\n\nstudying, planning and implementing long term requirements\n\nof environmental safety and to give direction to, and co-\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_20\">ordinate a system of         speedy and adequate response to\n\nemergency situations threatening the environment.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\">3. In view of what has been stated above, there is urgent need\n\nfor the enactment of a general legislation on environmental\n\nprotection which inter alia, should enable co-ordination of\n\nactivities of the various regulatory agencies, creation of an\n\nauthority     or   authorities   with    adequate         powers   for\n\nenvironmental      protection,   Regulation     of   discharge      of\n\nenvironmental      pollutants    and    handling     of    hazardous\n\nsubstances, speedy response in the event of accidents\n\nthreatening environment and deterrent punishment to those\n\nwho endanger human environment, safety and health.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_22\">4.

Noise as nuisance and health hazard.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_49\">        Noise is more than just a nuisance. It constitutes a real and\n        present danger to people&#x27;s health. Day and night, at home,\n        at work, and at play, noise can produce serious physical\n        and psychological stress. No one is immune to this stress.\n        Though we seem to adjust to noise by ignoring it, the ear, in\n        fact, never closes and the body still responds-sometimes\n        with extreme tension, as to a strange sound in the night.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_50\">        Noise is a type of atmospheric pollution. It is a shadowy\n        public enemy whose growing menace has increased in the\n        modern age of industrialization and technological\n        advancement. Although a soft rhythmic sound in the form\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                                    12</span>\n             of music and dance stimulates brain activities, removes\n            boredom and fatigue, but its excessiveness may prove\n            detrimental to living things. Researches have proved that a\n            loud noise during peak marketing hours creates tiredness,\n            irritation and impairs brain activities so as to reduce\n            thinking and working abilities. Noise pollution was\n            previously confined to a few special areas like factory or\n            mill, but today it engulfs every nook and corner of the\n            globe, reaching its peak in urban areas. Industries,\n            automobiles,       rail   engines,     aeroplanes,    radios,\n            loudspeakers, tape recorders, lottery ticket sellers,\n            hawkers, pop singers, etc., are the main ear contaminators\n            of the city area and its market place. The regular rattling of\n            engines and intermittent blowing of horns emanating from\n            the caravan of automobiles do not allow us to have any\n            respite from irritant noise even in suburban zones.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_51\">            In the modern days noise has become one of the major\n            pollutants and it has serious effects on human health.\n            Effects of noise depend upon sound&#x27;s pitch, its frequency\n            and time pattern and length of exposure. Noise has both\n            auditory and non-auditory effects depending upon the\n            intensity and the duration of the noise level. It affects sleep,\n            hearing, communication, mental and physical health. It\n            may even lead to the madness of people.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_52\">            However, noises, which are melodious, whether natural or\n            man-made, cannot always be considered as factors leading\n            to pollution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_53\">12.   Noise can disturb our work, rest, sleep, and communication. It can\n\n  damage our hearing and evoke other psychological, and possibly pathological\n\n  reactions. However, because of complexity, variability and the interaction of\n\n  noise with other environmental factors, the adverse health effects of noise do\n\n  not lend themselves to a straightforward analysis.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_54\">      (i)       Hearing Loss\n\n                &quot;Deafness, like poverty, stunts and deadens its\n                victims.&quot;- says Helen Keller. Hearing loss can be either\n                temporary or permanent. Noise-induced temporary\n                threshold shift (NITTS) is a temporary loss of hearing\n                acuity experienced after a relatively short exposure to\n                excessive noise. Pre-exposure hearing is recovered\n                fairly rapidly after cessation of the noise. Noise induced\n                permanent threshold shift (NIPTS) is an irreversible loss\n                of hearing that is caused by prolonged noise exposure.\n                Both kinds of loss together with presbyacusis, the\n                permanent hearing impairment that is attributable to\n                the natural aging process, can be experienced\n                simultaneously.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_55\">                NIPTS occurs typically at high frequencies, usually with\n                a maximum loss at around 4,000 Hz. It is now accepted\n                that the risk of hearing loss is negligible at noise\n                exposure levels of less than 75 dB(A) Leq (8-hr). Based\n                on national judgments concerning acceptable risk,\n                many countries have adopted industrial noise exposure\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                                         13</span>\n         limits of 85 dB(A) ± 5 dB(A) in their regulations and\n        recommended practices.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_56\">(ii)    Interference with Communication\n\n        The interference of noise with speech communication is\n        a process in which one of two simultaneous sounds\n        renders the other inaudible. An important aspect of\n        communication interference in occupational situations is\n        that the failure of workers to hear warning signals or\n        shouts may lead to injury. In offices, schools and\n        homes, speech interference is a major source of\n        annoyance.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_57\">(iii)   Disturbance of sleep.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_58\">        Noise intrusion can cause difficulty in falling asleep\n        and can awaken people who are asleep.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_59\">(iv)    Annoyance\n\n        Noise annoyance may be defined as a feeling of\n        displeasure evoked by noise. The annoyance inducing\n        capacity of a noise depends upon many of its physical\n        characteristics and variations of these with time.\n        However, annoyance reactions are sensitive to many\n        non-acoustic factors of a social, psychological, or\n        economic nature and there are considerable differences\n        in individual reactions to the same noise.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_60\">(v)     Effect on performance\n\n        Noise can change the state of alertness of an individual\n        and may increase or decrease efficiency. Performance\n        of tasks involving motor or monotonous activities is not\n        always degraded by noise. At the other extreme,\n        mental activities involving vigilance, information\n        gathering and analytical processes appear to be\n        particularly sensitive to noise.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_61\">(vi)    Physiological Effects\n\n         It has been determined that noise has an explicit effect\n        on the blood vessels, especially the smaller ones known\n        as pre-capillaries. Overall, noise makes these blood\n        vessels narrower. Noise causes the peripheral blood\n        vessels in the toes, fingers, skin and abdominal organs\n        to constrict, thereby decreasing the amount of blood\n        normally supplied to these areas.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_62\">        Possible clinical manifestations of stress concomitant\n        with noise are : (i) galvanic skin response, (ii) increased\n        activity related to ulcer formation, (iii)changes in\n        intestinal motility, (iv)changes in skeletal muscle\n        tension, (v) subjective response irritability perception of\n        loudness, (vi)increased sugar, cholesterol &amp; adrenaline,\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_63\">        (vii)changes in heart rate, (viii)increased blood pressure,\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_64\">        (ix) increased adrenal hormones, (x)vasoconstriction.\n        Not only might there be harmful consequences to health\n        during the state of alertness, but research also\n        suggests effects may occur when the body is unaware\n        or asleep.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                                 14</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_65\">         The investigations have revealed that the blood vessels\n        which feed the brain, dilate in the presence of noise.\n        This is the reason why headaches result from listening\n        to persistent high noise.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_66\">        Field studies have also been conducted on various\n        other groups such as people living near airports, and\n        school children exposed to traffic noise, showing that\n        there may be some risk for these people. In addition,\n        laboratory studies on animals and humans have\n        demonstrated a relationship between noise and high\n        blood pressure. Other studies have shown that noise\n        can induce heart attacks.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_67\">        Prolonged chronic noise can also produce stomach\n        ulcers as it may reduce the flow of gastric juice and\n        change its acidity.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_68\">        With what other stress effects can noise be associated?\n        Stress can be manifested in any number of ways,\n        including headaches, irritability, insomnia, digestive\n        disorders, and psychological disorders.

The\nbursting of firecrackers during this period is a wide\nspread practice. The unpredictable, intermittent and\nimpulsive noise produced by bursting of crackers all\naround, turns the festival of lights into cacophony of\nnoise. People are unable to even sleep due to this\nexcessive noise pollution. Several people are injured\ndue to the noise produced by firecrackers every year.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_88\">Firecrackers not only increase the ambient noise level\nbut also contribute significantly in increasing the air\npollution by means of toxic gases and particles due to\ntheir blast wave resulting from a rapid release of\nenergy. In order to assess the situation of noise\npollution caused by firecrackers at the time of Diwali\nthe Central Pollution Control Board (<a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_25\">CPC</a>B) has been\nconducting ambient noise level monitoring during\nDiwali festival regularly at various locations in Delhi\nsince 1993, to find increased ambient noise level\ncaused by intensive burning of crackers. As in the past,\nthe noise and air quality monitoring have been carried\nout in the years 1999, 2000, 2001, and 2002.

The ambient noise level conducted during\nthe years 1999 to 2002 on Diwali festival, exceeded the\nlimit at all places in every year and the percentage of\nviolation varies from 2% to 58%. Thus, the study does\nreveal that the noise levels that have been measured on\nall these occasions have been more than the prescribed\nnorms. This is a point of worry as it has been\ndiscussed that noise pollution does tend to have\nadverse effects on a person.

The right comprehends freedom\nto be free from what one desires to be free from.\nFree speech is not to be treated as a promise to\neveryone with opinions and beliefs, to gather at any\nplace and at any time and express their views in\nany manner. The right is subordinate to peace and\norder. A person can decline to read a publication, or\nswitch off a radio or a television set. But, he cannot\nprevent the sound from a loudspeaker reaching\nhim. He could be forced to hear what he wishes not\nto hear. That will be an invasion of his right to be let\nalone, to hear what he wants to hear, or not to\nhear, what he does not wish to hear. One may put\nhis mind or hearing to his own uses, but not that of\nanother. No one has a right to trespass on the mind\nor ear of another and commit auricular or visual\naggression. A loudspeaker is mechanical device,\nand it has no mind or thought process in it.\nRecognition of the right of speech or expression is\nrecognition accorded to a human faculty. A right\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">                         24</span>\n belongs to human personality, and not to a\nmechanical device. One may put his faculties to\nreasonable uses. But, he cannot put his machines\nto any use he likes. He cannot use his machines to\ninjure others. Intervention with a machine, is not\nintervention with, or invasion of a human faculty or\nright. No mechanical device can be upgraded to a\nhuman faculty. A computer or a robot cannot be\nconceded the right under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_56\">Article 19 (though they\nmay be useful to man to express his faculties).</a> No\nmore, a loudspeaker.

In our\nview, in a civilized society in the name of religion,\nactivities which disturb old or infirm persons,\nstudents or children having their sleep in the early\nhours or during daytime or other persons carrying\non other activities cannot be permitted. It should not\nbe forgotten that young babies in the neighbourhood\nare also entitled to enjoy their natural right of\nsleeping in a peaceful atmosphere.

This widespread non- recognition of noise\n\npollution problem, in a similar fashion as to air and water pollution\n\nproblems, could be attributed to reasons such as; by the definition and\n\nperception of noise as a subjective experience, short decay time, and\n\ndifficulty to associate cause with effect when it comes to health impacts.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_141\">Depending on its duration and volume, the effects of noise on human\n\nhealth and comfort are divided into four categories; physical effects, such\n\nas hearing defects; physiological effects, such as increased blood pressure,\n\nirregularity of heart rhythms and ulcers; psychological effects, such as\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">                                27</span>\n disorders, sleeplessness and going to sleep late, irritability and stress; and\n\nfinally, effects on work performance, such as reduction of productivity and\n\nmisunderstanding what is heard.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_142\">20.

There is a need for creating general awareness towards the hazardous\n\n  effects of noise pollution.

Special talks and lectures be organised in the schools to highlight\n\n  the menace of noise pollution and the role of the children and younger\n\n  generation in preventing it. Police and civic administration should be trained\n\n  to understand the various methods to curb the problem and also the laws on\n\n  the subject.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_145\">           The State must play an active role in this process.\n           Residents Welfare Associations, Service Clubs and\n           Societies engaged in preventing noise pollution as a part\n           of their projects need to be encouraged and actively\n           involved by the local administration.

The matter was previously raised before the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court of\n\n  India in the case of M.C. Mehta Vs. Union of India &amp; Ors., Writ Petition (Civil)\n\n  No. 13029 of 1985 dated 24.08.2018 and Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court dealt with the\n\n  matter as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_41\">                 16. It is an established principle of law that the\n                 right to life, as envisaged under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_67\">Article 21</a> of the\n                 Constitution of India includes the right to a decent\n                 environment. It includes within its ambit the right\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">                                         29</span>\n               of a citizen to live in a clean environment. With\n              regard to vehicular traffic, this Court has issued a\n              number of directions to ensure a clean\n              environment and reduce pollution. It has been\n              held that the right to clean environment is a\n              fundamental rights. The right to live in an\n              environment free from smoke and pollution follows\n              from the &quot;quality&quot; of life which is an inherent part\n              of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_68\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. The right to live\n              with human dignity becomes illusory in the\n              absence of a healthy environment. The right to life\n              not only means leading a life with dignity but\n              includes within its ambit the right to lead a\n              healthy, robust life in a clean atmosphere free from\n              pollution. Obviously, such rights are not absolute\n              and     have    to     co-exist   with   sustainable\n              development. Therefore, if there is a conflict\n              between health and wealth, obviously, health will\n              have to be given precedence. When we are\n              concerned with the health of not one citizen but the\n              entire citizenry including the future citizens of the\n              country, the larger public interest has to outweigh\n              the much smaller pecuniary interest of the\n              industry, in this case the automobile industry,\n              especially when the entire wherewithal to introduce\n              the cleaner technology exists.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_147\">23.     <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_69\">CPC</a>B has issued certain guidelines and rules are framed with regard to\n\n  the noise pollution.

It is well-settled that the right to propagate\n    one&#x27;s religion means the right to communicate a\n    person&#x27;s belief to another or to expose the tenets of\n    that faith. The question is whether the right to\n    propagate religion includes the right to use loud-\n    speakers and microphones for the purpose of\n    chanting religious tenets or religious texts and/or\n    the indiscriminate use of microphones or loud-\n    speakers during religious performance in the\n    society.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_82\">    17.

An individual is entitled to sleep as\ncomfortably and as freely as he breathes. Sleep is\nessential for a human being to maintain the\ndelicate balance of health necessary for its very\nexistence and survival. Sleep is, therefore, a\nfundamental and basic requirement without which\nthe existence of life itself would be in peril. To\ndisturb sleep, therefore, would amount to torture\nwhich is now accepted as a violation of human\nright. It would be similar to a third degree method\nwhich at times is sought to be justified as a\nnecessary police action to extract the truth out of\nan accused involved in heinous and cold- blooded\ncrimes.

In the case of Church of God (Supra), the\nSupreme Court has held that no religion prescribes\nthat prayers should be performed by disturbing\nthe peace of others nor does it preach that they\nshould be through voice amplifiers or beating of\ndrums. In a civilized society in the name of religion,\nactivities which disturb old or infirm persons,\nstudents or children having their sleep in the early\nhours or during daytime or other persons carrying\non other activities cannot be permitted. A student\npreparing for his examination is entitled to\nconcentrate on his studies without their being any\nunnecessary disturbance by the neighbours.\nSimilarly, the old and the infirm are entitled to\nenjoy reasonable quietness during their leisure\nhours without there being any nuisance of noise\npollution. Aged, sick, people afflicted with psychic\ndisturbances as well as children up to 6 years of\nage are considered to be very sensitive to noise.\nTheir rights are also required to be honoured.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_187\">26.

A citizen\nhas a right to leisure, right to sleep, right not to\nhear and right to remain silent. He has also the\nright to read and speak with others.

Rule 5 deals with not only use of loud-\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_210\">  speakers/public address system but it also deals\n  with sound producing instruments or a musical\n  instrument or a sound amplifier. Under Sub-rule (1)\n  of Rule 5, it is provided that a loud-speaker or a\n  public address system shall not be used except\n  after obtaining written permission from the\n  Authority under the Noise Pollution Rules. Sub-rule\n  (2) provides that a loudspeaker or a public address\n  system or any sound producing instrument or a\n  musical instrument or a sound amplifier shall not\n  be used at night time except in closed premises\n  such as auditorium, conference halls, banquet\n  halls, community halls or during a public\n  emergency. The Schedule under the Rules of 2000,\n  defines night time to mean the period between\n  10.00\n  p.m. to 6.00 a.m. Day time is defined as 6.00 am\n  to 10.00 pm. Thus, even if permission is granted\n  under Sub-rule (1) of Rule\n  (5) to use loudspeakers or public address systems,\n  the same cannot be used between 10.00 pm till\n  6.00 a.m. Then comes Sub-rule (3) which confers\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_70\">                      43</span>\n power of relaxation on the State Government. It\nconfers power on the State to permit the use of\nloudspeakers or public address system and the\nlike during night hours (between 10.00 p.m. to\n12.00 midnight) on or during any cultural or\nreligious festive occasion not exceeding fifteen\ndays in all during a calendar year. The said Sub-\nRule requires the concerned State Government to\nspecify in advance, the number and particulars of\nthe days on which such exemption would be\noperative. Sub-rule (3) is an exception carved out\nwhich permits the State Government to relax the\nprohibition under Sub-rule (3) for a period of 15\ndays in a calender year by permitting use of\nloudspeakers/public address systems or the like\nonly between 10 pm to 12 midnight.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_211\">31.        The challenge to Sub-rule (3) was negated\nby the Apex Court in the case of Noise Pollution\n(VII) Vs. Union of India and Ors. (2005) 8 SCC 796.\nIn paragraph 8 of the said decision the Apex Court\nheld thus:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_90\">&quot;8. Looking at the diversity of cultures and\nreligions in India, we think that a limited power of\nexemption from the operation of the Noise Rules\ngranted by the Central Government in exercise of\nits statutory power cannot be held to be\nunreasonable. The power to grant exemption is\nconferred on the State Government. It cannot be\nfurther delegated. The power shall be exercised by\nreference to the State as a unit and not by\nreference to districts, so as to specify different\ndates for different districts. It can be reasonably\nexpected that the State Government would exercise\nthe power with due care and caution and in the\npublic interest. However, we make it clear that the\nscope of the exemption cannot be widened either\nby increasing the number of days or by increasing\nthe duration beyond two hours. If that is attempted\nto be done, then the said Sub-rule (3) conferring\npower to grant exemption may be liable to be\nstruck down as violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_102\">Article 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_103\">21</a> of the\nConstitution. We also make it clear that the State\nGovernment should generally specify in advance,\nthe number and particulars of the days on which\nsuch exemption        will   be    operative.  Such\nspecification would exclude arbitrariness in the\nexercise of power. The exemption, when granted,\nshall not apply to silence zone areas. This is only\nas a clarification as this even otherwise is the\nposition of law.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_212\">32.

Noise pollution is an emerging environmental threat, prolonged\n\n  exposure of which can cause annoyance, sleep disturbance, hypertension,\n\n  psychiatric disorders, and also hormonal dysfunction. Among all the sources\n\n  of noise pollution, the noise generated by road vehicle traffic significantly\n\n  affects the quality of urban environments. Concerning the recent imposition\n\n  of COVID- 19 societal lockdown, the average noise levels before lockdown\n\n  and during lockdown were found to be in the range of 44.85 dB to 79.57 dB\n\n  and 38.55 dB to 57.79 dB, respectively, for different zones. Although a\n\n  significant reduction in the noise levels was observed during lockdown,\n\n  except for commercial zone, all other monitoring stations had reported sound\n\n  levels quite higher than the recommended noise limits set by the Central\n\n  Pollution Control Board (<a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_104\">CPC</a>B) of India. Results further indicated that the\n\n  impact of road traffic noise on risk of high annoyance and sleep disturbance\n\n  was found to be lower during lockdown as compared to that of pre-lockdown\n\n  and unlock phase. While the annoyance level in residential (86.23%),\n\n  industrial (87.44%), and silence (84.47%) was higher in pre-lockdown period,\n\n  it reduced to 41.25, 50.28, and 43.07% in the lockdown phase. Even the\n\n  risk of sleep disturbance in the residential zone was found to reduce from\n\n  37.96%     during    pre-lockdown       to    14.72%      during        lockdown.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_72\">                                     45</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_218\">       The Central Pollution Control Board (<a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_105\">CPC</a>B) of India has recommended noise\n\n      limits of 55 and 45 dB during day time and night time in residential areas;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_219\">      75 and 70 dB in industrial areas; 65 and 55 dB in commercial; and 50 and\n\n      40 dB during the day and night time in silence zones. Considering the\n\n      prescribed limits, the percentage of times the hourly equivalent sound level\n\n      exceeds the threshold values in the pre-lockdown, lockdown, and unlock\n\n      phase during day and night-time.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_220\">29.        With the implementation of nationwide and state lockdown programs,\n\n      there were travel restrictions causing reduction in traffic and number of\n\n      honking    incidents.   Although   essential   and   emergency   services   were\n\n      operational during lockdown, there were restrictions in human mobility,\n\n      social, economic, commercial and other industrial activities. Recognizing\n\n      that transportation noise can adversely impact people&#x27;s well-being, lifestyle,\n\n      and local economy, many aspects of lockdown period can be considered\n\n      further for devising new policies and guidelines towards noise pollution\n\n      abatement. Although it is not feasible to impose lockdown or eliminate traffic\n\n      from the cities, proper traffic management strategies can control the negative\n\n      effects of noise   pollution significant reduction in noise levels can be\n\n      achieved through stringent traffic reduction strategies. Several interventions\n\n      such as no honking policy, substitution of motorized private transport by\n\n      active transport mode Such as walking and cycling for short trips, parking\n\n      management, and restricting access for the noisiest vehicles can reduce\n\n      noise pollution, improve road safety, provide recreational value to all the\n\n      users, and improve health of the communities. While cycling and walking\n\n      offer health benefits and reduce noise, emissions, and congestion, providing\n\n      proper bicycle paths and walkways is equally important for the efficient\n\n      mobility of cyclistsand pedestrians.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_221\">30.        Adoption of greener environment are characteristics of the built\n\n  environment such as view or access to green spaces in the neighborhood or\n\n  having access to a quiet area can reduce annoyance and the negative\n\n  response to road traffic noise. The construction of green belts around roads,\n\n  vegetation, and incorporation of green spaces in the cities or even green\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_73\">                                          46</span>\n roof installations can be considered as several measures to help attenuate\n\nnoise exposure especially in the residential, silence, and industrial zones.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_222\">Road infrastructure Consideration of noise-reducing pavements, traffic noise\n\nimpedance walls, and quieter vehicles and installation of natural or artificial\n\nnoise barriers, no-horn sign, and other traffic-calming measures can reduce\n\nnoise level at high sound level zones. Implementation of such measures in\n\nresidential, silence, and commercial zones can provide a livable, workable,\n\nand healthy environment for the people residing in nearby areas.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_223\">31.   It is argued that due to complete neglect and apathy on part of the\n\nRespondents in failing to comply with strict compliance of Rule (115) sub-rule\n\n(7) of the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989 and thereby failing to ensure\n\nthat only those vehicles that carry valid &quot;Pollution under control&quot; (PUC)\n\ncertificate issued by the authorized agency are permitted to ply in the State\n\nand thereby adversely affecting the health and lives of millions of people all\n\nover the State and to Limit the number of PUC centres, upgrade them and\n\nbring them under strong supervision and quality control, make quality audit\n\nof centres and calibration quarterly, Upgrade Testing Centres for high level of\n\nautomatic emissions testing so that operators and vehicle drivers do not come\n\nin contact to influence the test results and credible and upgraded tests are\n\nconducted and Introduce well equipped        mobile    test centres    and   a\n\nprogramme to check visibly polluting vehicles.&quot;\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_224\">32.

On the other hand, Ms. Aparajita Singh,\nlearned      amicus          curiae,           has      made     a\npassionate plea that no non-BS-VI compliant\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_76\">                                 49</span>\n vehicle should be permitted to be sold in the\nentire    country     after    01.04.2020.        She   has\ndrawn our attention to the Report of the\nParliamentary Standing Committee (for short\n&#x27;the     Committee&#x27;)     dated      07.08.2018.         This\nReport mainly deals            with National Capital\nRegion (NCR) of Delhi but there are some\nreferences to the entire country. Some of the\nobservations made by the Committee need to\nbe     considered      and     taken      note    of.   The\nCommittee in Para 5.15 notes that the problem\nof air pollution is affecting all human beings\nand      any   leniency        on   the    part    of    the\nGovernment       in    tackling      it   will    have    a\ncascading effect on the health of the citizens.\nThese observations have been made with\nspecific reference to vehicular pollution and\nthe need to ensure compliance of BS-VI norms\nwith effect from 0.1.04.2020. There can be no\ntwo views that air pollution is hazardous to\nhealth. We may, also take note of certain\nobservations of the Report of the Committee\nwhich show that one out of three children in\nDelhi suffers from respiratory problems. This\nis almost twice as high as compared to the\ncity of Kolkata or rural areas. We may note\nthat the World Health Organization&#x27;s (WHO)\ndatabase of more than 4,300 cities showed\nIndian cities of Gwalior, Allahabad, Raipur,\nDelhi,     Ludhiana,     Khanna,          Varanasi      and\nPatna as being among the most polluted in the\n\nworld1. Our attention has been drawn to\nvarious other documents which clearly show\nthe deleterious effects of pollution on health.\nThe hazards of pollution and its ill effect on\nthe health of the citizens especially children\nare not limited to the city of Delhi or the NCR\nof Delhi but affect all the citizens of the\ncountry.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_100\">13.         With regard to trucks and buses,\nfrom a news item published in the Financial\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_77\">                          50</span>\n Express dated 06.07.2018, it is apparent that\nEicher is already manufacturing trucks and\nbuses which are not only BS-VI compliant but\nBS-VI CNG compliant. Another                manufacturer\nof heavy vehicles i.e. Ashok Leyland had, in\nAugust, 2018 through its subsidiary Optare\nobtained an order to manufacture the world&#x27;s\nfirst,   electric    double      decker      buses.        The\ntechnology needed           to    manufacture              such\nelectric buses is much more advanced and\ndifficult as compared to the technological\nchanges required to manufacture petrol and\ndiesel vehicles which are BS-VI compliant.\nSimilarly, TVS Motors on 07.08.2018 has\nissued     a     press    note       that    it     will    be\nmanufacturing           BS-VI    compliant          vehicles\nmuch ahead of the deadline of 2020. Many\nmembers of SIAM in the Auto Expo held in\nFebruary,        2018     have    exhibited         vehicles\nwhich      are      technologically         much       more\nadvanced        than     BS-VI   compliant          vehicles.\nThese manufacturers have not only asserted\nthat they can manufacture electric vehicles\nbut also asserted that they are developing\nhydrogen cell fuel vehicles along with hybrid,\nelectric and CNG vehicles.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_101\"> 14. We have mentioned these facts only to\n highlight that some of the manufacturers are\n not willing to comply with the 31.03.2020\n deadline not because they do not have the\n technology but because the use of technology\n will lead to increase in the cost of the\n vehicles which may lead to reduction in sales\n of the vehicles and ultimately their profit.\n There can be no compromise with the health\n of the citizens and if           one has to choose\n between health and wealth, keeping in view\n the expanded scope of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_106\">Article 21</a> of the\n Constitution, health of the teeming millions of\n this country will have to take precedence\n over     the     greed    of    a     few        automobile\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_78\">                           51</span>\n manufacturers.                  The            automobile\nmanufacturers must behave responsibly. We\nexpected that keeping in view our earlier\norder,      they        would        have     themselves\nvolunteered         to    be    BS-VI       compliant      by\n31.03.2020. Unfortunately, this has not been\nthe case with some of the manufacturers and\nthey want to stretch on the timeline by a few\ndays or     months for no other reason but to\nmake a little more money.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_102\">15. When we compare BS-VI fuel with BS-IV\nfuel, there is a massive               improvement          in\nenvironmental terms. Once BS-VI emission\nnorms are enforced, there                will be a 68%\nimprovement in PM2.5. This is not a small\nchange. It     is   a vast      improvement and the\nfaster it is brought, the better              it     is. The\namicus curiae has strenuously urged that, at\nleast, in the NCR of Delhi, the BS- VI norms\nbe   applied      for    sale   of      vehicles          from\n01.04.2020.         We feel that it may not be\npractical    to     introduce         BS-VI        compliant\nvehicles    region-wise         or    city-wise.     In    our\nview, the BS-IV experiment in this regard\nwas not very successful. BS-VI compliant\nvehicles are going to be more expensive than\nBS-IV    compliant       vehicles.      People      have    a\ntendency to buy cheaper vehicle(s) even from\na neighboring city. We also strongly feel that\nthe problem of pollution is not limited to the\nNCR of Delhi but it is a problem which has\nengulfed the entire country especially the\nmajor cities. India has the dubious distinction\nof having 15 out of the 20 most polluted cities\nin the world. The pollution in Gwalior, Raipur\n&amp; Allahabad is             worse than Delhi. The\nsituation is alarming and critical. It brooks\nno delay.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_103\">16. It is an established principle of law that\nthe right to life, as envisaged under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_107\">Article 21</a>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_79\">                          52</span>\n of the Constitution of India includes the right\nto a decent environment. It includes within\nits ambit       the right of a citizen to live in a\nclean environment. With regard to vehicular\ntraffic, this Court has issued a number of\ndirections to ensure a clean environment\nand reduce pollution. It has been held that\nthe     right       to   clean       environment         is    a\nfundamental rights. The right to live in an\nenvironment free from smoke and pollution\nfollows from the &quot;quality&quot; of life which is an\ninherent        part      of      <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_108\">Article    21</a>     of        the\nConstitution. The right to live with human\ndignity becomes illusory in the absence of a\nhealthy environment. The right to life not\nonly means leading a life with dignity but\nincludes within its ambit the right to lead a\nhealthy, robust life in a clean atmosphere\nfree from pollution. Obviously, such rights\nare   not       absolute       and    have    to    co-exist\nwith sustainable development. Therefore, if\nthere    is     a    conflict between health and\nwealth, obviously, health will have to be\ngiven precedence. When we are concerned\nwith the health of not one citizen but the\nentire citizenry including the future citizens\nof the country, the larger public interest has\nto outweigh the much smaller pecuniary\ninterest of the industry, in this case the\nautomobile industry, especially when the\nentire wherewithal to introduce the cleaner\ntechnology exists.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_104\">17.       It is therefore necessary to ensure\nthat BS-VI compliance is uniform throughout\nthe country so that even those areas of the\ncountry which fortunately have not suffered\nthe ills of extreme pollution are safe in the\nfuture. The sale of automobiles                    and other\nvehicles      is    rising     exponentially       and        the\nnumber of vehicles on the road is increasing\nday by day. Therefore, even a day&#x27;s delay in\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_80\">                             53</span>\n enforcing BS-VI norms is going to harm the\nhealth of the people. We are dealing here with\na     situation         where           children        and     unborn\nchildren suffer from pollution and issues of\ninter- generational equity are involved. Do we\nas     a        society       or        as     manufacturers           of\nautomobiles have a right to manufacture\nmore polluting vehicles when we have the\ntechnology             to    manufacture              less     polluting\nvehicles? The answer is obviously a big NO.\nIf we were to factor only economics even then\nit makes no economic sense to have more\npolluting vehicles on the roads. The effect of\npollution on the environment and health is so\nhuge that it cannot be compensated in the\nmarginal               extra             profits         that         the\nmanufacturers                might           make.      The     amount\nspent on countering the ills of pollution such\nas polluted air, damaged lungs and the cost\nof healthcare far outweigh the profits earned.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_105\">18.         It.    was        urged           on      behalf    of    the\nmanufacturers                that            there     are     multiple\nsources           of    pollution            and      vehicles       only\ncontribute to 2% of the pollution. We are not\nin agreement with this submission because\nthe Report of the Committee to which we\nhave       adverted            hereinabove              states       that\ncontribution of vehicles to ambient PM2.5\nconcentration during winter season is 25%\nand in the summer season it contributes 9%.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_106\">Even       if     we        were        to    accept     the    figures\nsubmitted by SIAM, we are of the view that\nno step is too small when it comes to fighting\npollution. Small steps to reduce pollution\nwhen taken together will lead to large scale\nreduction in pollution which will result in\nmuch cleaner air, which eventually will result\nin     a        cleaner       and            better     environment,\nhealthier citizens and most importantly a\nhealthier generation to come.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_81\">                                   54</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_107\"> 19.      In        view       of    the    fact        that     these\nproceedings have been pending in court for a\nlong time and also in view of the fact that it is\nbecause of orders of this Court that BS-IV\nand now BS-VI norms have been introduced\nfrom the dates which were not even thought\nof by the Government, we feel that we have\nto take sup moto notice of the Rules. At the\noutset, we may notice that sub- rule 21 of\nRule 115 is very vague. It does not talk of\nsale of vehicles. It only mentions registration\nof    vehicles       and        permits         registration       of\nvehicles conforming to BS-IV norms up to\n30.06.2020 and in case of categories M &amp; N,\nup to 30.09.2020. This rule, in our view, is\nviolative of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_109\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution in as\nmuch as it extends time for registration of\nvehicles beyond 31.03.2020 and                             must be\naccordingly read down. Any extension of time\nin introducing the new norms which is not\nabsolutely necessary adversely impacts the\nhealth    of       the    citizens        and        is,   therefore,\nviolative of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_110\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of\nIndia. This Rule goes against the spirit of all\nthe orders passed earlier by this Court. In the\nmonth of March, 2017 we were dealing with\na situation when BS-VI norms were to be\nmade effective throughout the country with\neffect from 01.04.2020 and this Court had\ndirected that non- BS-IV compliant vehicles\nshall    not        be        registered         on        or   after\n01.04.2017. The                situation        in     the present\ncase is totally different.                  31.03.2020             is\nalmost         1         1/2       years    away.          There   is\nsufficient     time       for       the    manufacturers           to\nchange       over        to    the        new    system         and,\ntherefore, we see no reason why they should\nbe given a window of three or six months for\nsale of accumulated vehicles. Every vehicle\nsold after the cut-off date of 01.04.2020 is\nbound to cause more pollution and, therefore,\nthe manufacturers, in our considered view,\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_82\">                               55</span>\n cannot be permitted to sell any non-BS-VI\ncompliant vehicle on or after 01.04.2020. On\nthe one hand, the Government has been pro-\nactive in spending huge amounts of money to\nmove to the BS-VI technology, but on the\nother       hand,    the        automobile        industry    is\ncoming       up     with    a     variety     of    untenable\nexcuses just to delay the introduction of BS-\nVI compliant vehicles by a few months. We,\nin    our    judgment        dated      13.04.2017,         had\nclearly held &quot;when the health of millions of\nour     countrymen          is    involved,        notification\nrelating to commercial activities ought not to\nbe interpreted in a literal manner.&quot; We have to\ngive a purposive interpretation to notifications\nspecially those dealing with public health\nissues and even more so, when health not\nonly of the citizens at present but also the\ncitizens in the future is involved. There is\nmore        than         sufficient        time     for      the\nmanufacturers              to      manufacture            BS-VI\ncompliant vehicles. They already have the\ntechnology          to    do      so.   The        automobile\nindustry must show the will, responsibility\nand urgency in this regard.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_108\">20.         The Government has developed a\npolicy of phasing out polluting vehicles and\ndiscouraging the manufacturers of polluting\nvehicles. This has been done in a gradual\nmanner. Europe introduced Euro-IV fuel in\nthe year 2009 and Euro-VI standards in\n2015. We are already many years behind\nthem. We cannot afford to fall back further\neven by a single day. The need of the hour is\nto move to a cleaner                fuel    as      early    as\npossible.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_109\">21.

The Applicant submits that Schedule VI, in part E of the\n\n  Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986 specify the noise limits\n\n  relating to noise standards for vehicles at the manufacturing stage\n\n  with effect from 1st July, 2005, which is to be monitored as per test\n\n  method IS: 3028-1988,. The Applicant claims that he came to know\n\n  recently that the Respondents are neither monitoring the noise\n\n  levels of constructed vehicles at the manufacturing stage, in\n\n  accordance with IS: 3028-1988 nor they are ensuring compliance of\n\n  noise limits by these vehicles, as specified in Schedule VI, Part E, of\n\n  the Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986. The Applicant further\n\n  submits that the noise pollution caused by the moving vehicles is,\n\n  by far the biggest contributor to the noise pollution all over                 the\n\n  country and, therefore, it is necessary to enforce and monitor the\n\n  compliance of noise standards for the vehicles at manufacturing\n\n  stage, as prescribed under Schedule VI, Part E, of the Environment\n\n  (Protection) Rules, 1986. The Applicant further submits that the <a href=\"/doc/82542966/\" id=\"a_112\">Air\n\n  (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981</a>, has defined the &quot;air\n\n  pollutants&quot; as any solid, liquid or gaseous substance (including\n\n  noise) in the atmosphere in such concentration as may be or\n\n  tend to be injurious to human beings or other living creatures or\n\n  plants or the property or environment. He further submits that by\n\n  subsequent amendment the &#x27;noise&#x27; has also been included as\n\n  an &#x27;air pollutant&#x27; in the said Act. The Applicant               further   submits\n\n  that under <a href=\"/doc/131444632/\" id=\"a_113\">Section 16</a> of      the     said       Act,   the   Central     Pollution\n\n  Control Board has overall responsibility to improve quality of air\n\n  and to prevent, control or abate air pollution in the country.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_231\">  Further, it is contended that as per Sub Section (2) (h) of <a href=\"/doc/131444632/\" id=\"a_114\">Section 16</a>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_84\">                                       57</span>\n   of this Act, the Respondent No.3, is required to lay down standards\n\n  for   the quality of air.   The    applicant    also   submits      that    State\n\n  Pollution Control     Board,      i.e.    Respondent   No.4    is     required\n\n  under <a href=\"/doc/69926654/\" id=\"a_115\">Section 17(i) (g)</a> of this Act, to lay down, in consultation with\n\n  the   Central Board, and having regard to standards for quality of\n\n  air, laid down by the Central Board, standards for emission of air\n\n  pollutants     into the atmosphere. The Applicant also submits that\n\n  Maharashtra Pollution Control Board            (MPCB),      has     powers      to\n\n  give instructions and directions under Section 31 A of the said Act\n\n  for ensuring implementation of emissions standards discharged by\n\n  automobiles, any vehicles or machinery in the atmosphere.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_232\">35.     In the absence of an effective mechanism to enforce and\n\n  implement the Noise standards prescribed under the EP Rules and\n\n  Motor Vehicles Rules, the noise pollution mainly in urban areas\n\n  cannot be effectively controlled. Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court and High Court\n\n  decisions referred by Applicant in the Application have                     given\n\n  significant impetus to the implementation              of     noise        related\n\n  regulations.    The Apex Court in WP (c) No.72 of 1998 with                    CA\n\n  No.3735 of 2005 (arising out of SLP (c) No.2185) (2005) 5 SCC 733\n\n  in &quot;Re: Noise Pollution vs Unknown 18 July, 2005&quot; observed that:\n</p>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_110\">            &quot;98. Not that the Legislature and the Executive in\n            India are completely unmindful of the menace of\n            noise pollution. Laws have been enacted and the\n            Rules have been framed by the Executive for\n            carrying on the purposes of the legislation. The real\n            issue is with the implementation of the laws.\n            What is needed is the will to implement the laws.\n            It would be useful to have a brief resume of some of\n            the laws which are already available on the Statute\n            Book. Treatment of the problem of noise pollution\n            can be dealt under the Law of Crimes and Civil\n            Law. Civil law can be divided under two heads (i)\n            The Law of Torts and (ii) The General Civil Law. The\n            cases regarding noise have not come before the\n            law courts in large quantity. The reason behind this\n            is that many people in India did not consider noise\n            as a sort of pollution and they are not very much\n            conscious about the evil consequences of noise\n            pollution. The level of noise pollution is relative\n            and depends upon a person and a particular place.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_85\">                                       58</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_111\">         The law will not take care of a super sensitive\n        person but the standard is of an average and\n        rational human being in the society.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_233\">        33. The Apex Court further observed that:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_112\">        169.       The need for checking noise pollution\n        as highlighted by the petitioners and several\n        interveners deserves appreciation.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_113\">        170.        Need for specific legislation to control\n        and prevent noise pollution still needs some\n        emphasis. Undoubtedly, some laws have been\n        enacted. Yet, compared with the legislation in\n        developed countries India is still lagging behind\n        in enacting adequate and scientific legislations.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_234\">        We need to have one simple but specific and\n        detailed legislation dealing with several aspects\n        referable to noise pollution and providing\n        measures of control therefore.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_235\">        171.         There is an equal need of developing\n        mechanism and infrastructure for enforcement of\n        the prevalent laws. Those who are entrusted with\n        the task of enforcing laws directed towards\n        controlling noise pollution, must be so trained as to\n        acquire expertize in the matter of fighting against\n        noise pollution by taking preventive and deterrent\n        measures both. They need to be equipped with the\n        requisite equipments such as audio meters as\n        would help them in detecting the level of noise\n        pollution more so when it crosses the permissible\n        limits and the source thereof.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_236\">        172.         Above all, there is need for creating\n        general awareness towards the hazardous effects\n        of noise pollution. &quot;\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_114\">36.   In substance, it can be observed that there is no effective\n\n  mechanism for implementation of noise standards for automobiles.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_115\">  Though the Respondents have taken some steps,            but    they   are\n\n  pointing fingers towards others in the context of duty to perform\n\n  the Rules. There is lack of synergy and coordination amongst the\n\n  Respondents. This cannot be allowed to continue, in view of the\n\n  serious impacts of noise pollution.      The   Apex   court   has   clearly\n\n  focused on implementation of existing regulations and also, need of\n\n  specific regulations   while   dealing    with   noise   pollution.

The State can ensure that the horns or other sound producing\n               device on vehicles should comply with Rule 119 of the Motor\n               Vehicle Rules and no vehicle with sound boxex or modified\n               exhaust should be permitted to ply Futher, requirement for\n               complying with these sould be indicated on the licenses and\n               looked into while issuing &amp; renewing license.\n                  Copy of the Action Plan by Department of Environment and\n                  Climate, Government of Goa is produced herewith,\n      II.

The State can have a dedicated 24*7 facility of mobile number\n               with WhatsApp to receive the public complaints on the issue of\n               noise pollution.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_141\">               Copy of the Action Plan for Controlling Air Pollution, submitted by\n               Delhi Pollution Control Board to Central Pollution Control Board\n               in compliance of Hon&#x27;ble National Green Tribunal&#x27;s order dated\n               08.10.2018 in O.A. No. 681/2018.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_258\">      IV.      The State can have a dedicated WhatsApp No. or public platform\n               wherein citizens can drop videographic proofs of noise Pollution.\n               Citizens can be rewarded with a portion from the fine collected\n               from the culprits as done under various Whistle blower schemes.\n               This type of public surveillance will not only help the State to\n               reach remotest parts of the State but will also incentivize citizens\n               to be part of the enforcement drive and additionally would make\n               them aware of their rights and need of nose free environment.\n      V.       The State can remove encroachment on roads to clear roads for\n               traffic so that there is minimal traffic congestion and noise\n               pollution is avoided.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_259\">      VI.      The State can intensify checking of pollution vehicles. Further, it\n               can identify the hotspots of noise pollution and have on-spot\n               fines for the polluting vehicles.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_260\">      VII.     The State Government can develop one-way streets to smoothen\n               the traffic flow at peak hours and restrict access to heavy\n               vehicles in residential area so as to avoid bottlenecks of traffic\n               flow and limit noise pollution caused due to congestion.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_100\">                                            72</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_261\"> VIII.   The State can publish list of penalties that have been imporsed\n        and actions taken against people/industries found polluting.\n        This information will provide deterrence and help improve\n        enforcement.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_262\">IX.     The State can enforce lane driving through heavy fine as in\n        Mumbai.      This   would   ensure   that   traffic   congestion   and\n        disruption cause due to undue lance changes is not cause and\n        resultant honking is avoided and minimized.\nX.      The State can adopt greening of flyovers and bridges in the form\n        of vertical gardens which will act as sound absorbers to the\n        excess noise produced.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_263\">XI.     The State can green the unpaved area/central verges, road berm\n        and road sides so that the plantation can act as sound barrier to\n        the excessive sound. The green cover alongside the roads can be\n        an effective barrier to the transmission of noise.\nXII.    The State can create a seprate subdivision within department of\n        environment (DOE) to curb &amp; inspect nose pollution in hotspots\n        (urban and forest) and enforece, nose pollution related orders\n        under Principal Secretary of DoE.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_264\">XIII.   The State can establish an Air Quality Management Division at\n        SPCB/PCC Head Quarters to oversee air quality management\n        activities in the State and interact with <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_123\">CPC</a>B\nXIV.    The State can introduce car free days wherein the general public\n        will be encouraged to use public transport system for commuting\n        which will reduce private vehicle traffic on road and lead to\n        lesser congestion which in turn would lead to lesser honking.\nXV.     The State can set up and publicize helpline in each city/town as\n        well as SPSB/PCC/HQ for complaints against reported non-\n        compliance.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_265\"> Long term Measures:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_142\"> i. The State may identify those vehicle manufacturers and vehicle models\n\n that employ the least amplitude in horns and may provide tax subsidy\n\n and incentives on their purchase. This will incentivize prospective\n\n customers to buy such models and promote such vehicle manufactures\n\n which will resultantly force other brands and vehicle manufacturers to\n\n follow the trail.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_143\"> ii. The State can enforce that horns in the vehicle shall be installed with\n\n noise limiter and noise level of any such horn installed in a vehicle shall\n\n not exceed 55 dB (A) at 2m distance from the vehicle.\n</blockquote>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_101\">                                     73</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_144\">        iii. The State can mandate Car Manufacturers that battery size of the\n\n       vehicles plying on roads should be reduced and is brought to the similar\n\n       capacity as of their European and American counterparts, so that drivers\n\n       become more cognizant and restrictive in use of their horns.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_145\">       iv. the state can mandate Motor Vehicle manufacturers to program horns\n\n       in such a way that for every honking action longer than 3 seconds, there\n\n       should be a beeper in the car that activates. The driver who honked must\n\n       press a button to shut it off. This action will cause deterrence and\n\n       consciousness in drivers regarding their horn use\n\n       v. The State can also mandate car manufacturers to design horns and\n\n       car cabins in such a way that a portion of the sound generated through\n\n       honking is channelled towards driver too. This will raise emotional cost\n\n       to use a horn on a driver.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_266\">45.     After considering above points as raised by the applicant, we are\n\n  of the view that the rules and regulation and notifications issued from\n\n  time to time by the Govt. of India, or <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_124\">CPC</a>B to improve the quality of\n\n  the    environment,      including        limiting   the   emission    of    vehicular\n\n  pollutants, both in new and used vehicles should be applied in the\n\n  State and the conditions as laid down in the affidavit must be complied\n\n  in letter and spirit. In light of the report submitted by PCB, we further\n\n  direct respondents to ensure strict compliance of Rule 115 sub Rule (7)\n\n  of the Central Motor Vehicle Rules, 1989 stipulated that only vehicles\n\n  that carry valid &quot;PUC: Certificate issued by authorised agency are\n\n  permitted to ply in the State so as to prevent air pollution due to\n\n  vehicles do not having PUC certificate, to record the PUC data only so\n\n  to    automatically     linked     with    the   Central    Server    with       uniform\n\n  standardise software, to limit the number of PUC centres upgrade\n\n  them     under     strong   supervision       and    quality   control,     to    ensure\n\n  100%compliance by linking annual vehicle                   insurance and vehicle\n\n  registration with PUC certificate, to adopt uniform and standardised\n\n  data recording and reporting format and uniform software and\n\n  introduce automatic online network for transmission of PUC data to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_102\">                                        74</span>\n  the Central Server and to allow proper analysis of data for remote\n\n auditing of PUC centres, to strengthen inspection of PUC centres for\n\n quality control and strengthen the licensing programme to ensure\n\n proper calibration authentic test, annual maintenance contract for the\n\n maintenance of all testing equipment and accessories training of\n\n operators, calibration of equipment etc. are carried out, to upgrade\n\n testing centres for high level of automatic emission testing so that\n\n operators and vehicles drivers are prevented from manipulation of\n\n results and to introduce well equipped mobile test centres and a\n\n programme to check visibly polluting vehicles.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_267\">46.
