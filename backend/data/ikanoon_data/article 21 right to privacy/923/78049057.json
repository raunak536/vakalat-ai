The petitioner trust works for the\ncreation of employment for women in the District of Amreli and is\nactive in the filed of protection of interest of women in the matter\nof employment and social issues.  Amreli District, and in particular,\nDamnagar Town, is the main centre of activity of the petitioner\nTrust.  The economy of Amreli District is largely based on\nagriculture and agriculture-based industries. The main crop is\ncotton.  Families which are having agricultural fields or are engaged\nin other ancillary activities are more or less well off.  Male\nmembers of the rest of the families have to migrate to other major\ncities in search of employment, leaving their families at local\nlevel. Female folk are constrained to work either at small diamond\npolishing centres or cotton Gins or cottonseed oil extraction plants.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_2\"> Real difficulty arises because of the shifts on which they are\nsupposed to work. Mostly the shifts are from 8.00 a.m.  to 4.00 p.m.,\n4.00 p.m. to 12 midnight and 12 midnight to 8.00 a.m. .  The area\nsurrounding Damnagar is principally cotton-growing area. Therefore,\nduring the season, the plants work 24 hours a day and this is the\ntime during which there is an extreme dearth of workmen and because\nof the working in shifts, women cannot be engaged between 7.00 p.m.\nand 6.00 a.m.  in view of the prohibition of <a href=\"/doc/978206/\" id=\"a_8\">section 66(1)(b)</a> of the\nAct, and during the morning and noon hours, they have to take care of\ntheir school-going children.  As a result of this, they are unable to\nengage themselves in any kind of economic activity.  Women of that\narea, are thus, constrained to be unemployed only because of the\nstatutory prohibition imposed by <a href=\"/doc/978206/\" id=\"a_9\">section 66(1)(b)</a> of the Act.\n</p> \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_3\">3.\tThe case made out by the\npetitioners in Special Civil Application No. 11532 of 2013 is as\nfollows:\n</p> \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">3.1\tThe petitioners are women\nof tribal areas of District Valsad.  Some of the petitioners are\nunskilled labours whereas some others are qualified individuals. \n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">Respondent No.3 is a Company registered under the <a href=\"/doc/1353758/\" id=\"a_10\">Companies Act, 1956</a>\nand is engaged in the manufacturing activities of various food\nproducts like wafers, etc. under the brand name  Balaji .\nRespondent No.3 is having its factory near village Dungri of Valsad\nDistrict. The respondent has been employing tribal women in its\nfactories on a mass scale and has been providing special facilities\nto such women workers of the factory.\n</p> \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_5\">3.2\tAccording to the\npetitioners, in the tribal areas of Valsad District dominated by\nDhedia Patel and other small tribal communities, it is a known\nphenomenon that the major, and in some case, the sole breadwinner of\nthe entire family are female members.  The petitioners have to attend\nto their daily domestic activities and thereafter the petitioners\nsearch for some suitable job/employment so that they can earn\nlivelihood for their family. As such, the petitioners keep on\nenquiring with the factories situated within close vicinity of their\nvillages for job vacancies.  However, time and again, it is informed\nby the management of such factories/establishments that in view of\nthe embargo put by <a href=\"/doc/978206/\" id=\"a_11\">section 66(1)(b)</a> of the Act, they are not able to\nengage the petitioners and other female workers as the timings\nprescribed in the said section is such that it comes in the way of\nthe owners of the factories in employing them in more than one\nshifts.  It has been conveyed that the rigour of the said section\nentailed criminal action and exposes the factory owners / management\nto criminal cases in case of slightest variation. This directly\naffects the job opportunities of the petitioners and results in the\ndenial of employment on the ground of gender.  \n</p>\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_6\">3.3\tAccording\nto the petitioners, sometimes the shifts in the factories are fixed\nkeeping in view the availability of electricity, transport facility,\ndistance from the prime localities etc. in which case, the second\nshift may end beyond 7.00 p.m. while third shift starts and ends\nmainly during the night hours.  Hence the embargo created by the\nimpugned section makes it restrictive to employ women employees in\nsuch shifts.  On the other hand, it may happen that all the women\nworkers may not be able to work in the first shift owing to the\ncapacity of a particular factory unit, as also because of domestic\ncommitments of women including fetching water, milking animals,\ntaking care of children, attending cultivation work etc. Hence, the\npetitioners make applications to the nearby factories to permit them\nto work in the night shifts.  As a matter of fact, more than 200\nwomen from tribal areas have made such applications to the respondent\nNo.3 and like factories. However, the respondent has shown inability\nto permit the petitioners to work in the 2nd\nor night shift because of restrictions imposed by virtue of the\nimpugned section.\n</p> \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_7\">4.\tSimilarly, the case made out\nby the petitioners in Special Civil Application No. 11533 of 2013 may\nbe summed up thus:\n</p> \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">4.1\tThe petitioners, for its\nmanufacturing activities, are engaging both male and female employees\nin its factory. Since the petitioners are engaged in the business of\nmanufacturing food products, as a market trend and owing to various\nreasons, the petitioners are mainly engaging female workers. As such,\nout of approximately 825 direct employees, almost 535 employees are\nfemale. The work includes testing of the raw materials, mixing of\ningredients, spices etc., supervising the cooking process, operating\nmachineries at the appropriate time, packaging the products etc.,\nwhich is performed by female employees better and more effectively\nand efficiently than male employees.\n</blockquote> \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">4.2\tThe factory of the\npetitioners is situated in a tribal area of Valsad District dominated\nby Dhedia Patel and other small tribal communities.  It is a known\nphenomenon that in tribal communities, the major, and in some cases,\nthe sole breadwinner of the entire family is the female members. \n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_8\">Female employees of the petitioners are mainly from such tribal\nvillages/areas in the vicinity of almost 30 to 50 kms. from the\nfactory. Hence because of the employment with the petitioners, the\nsocio-economic status of the said tribal families has witnessed a\npositive growth and change since the past few years. \n</p>\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_9\">4.3\tEver since the inception of\nthe establishment of the factory in question, there has not been any\nuntoward incident in the factory premises where any female worker has\nfaced any problem of sexual harassment or of any other nature. This\nis also because of the fact that almost all the staff including\nworkers, labourers, managerial and supervisory, and security\npersonnel, etc. are women. Moreover, the petitioners by providing\nextra facilities are safeguarding measures to such women employees\nsuch as free transportation from their respective villages, providing\nfree medical treatment at the factory as also, in almost five\ndesignated clinics in different villages.  Moreover, for the women\nhaving children, a child-care-centre is also provided in the factory\npremises.  The workers are provided with R.O. drinking water and are\nalso given uniform by the Company.  In case of ill-health of a worker\nduring working hours, special transportation is also provided to drop\nthe particular employee at his/her place.  In addition thereto, the\nworkers are provided with hygienic food at the rate of Rs.10/- per\nplate at the Canteen and free tea twice during a shift.  This is the\nreason that the petitioner-Company is always flooded with\napplications from women from nearby villages who are willing to work\nin the petitioners  factory in the day as well as in the night\nshifts.\n</p> \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_10\">4.4\tThe petitioners had also\nreceived written applications from almost 340 women employees\nrequesting the management to permit them to work in night shift so\nthat they can earn additional income and/or can come for work at\ntheir convenient timings. The petitioners, by communication dated 1st\nAugust 2012 addressed to the Director of Industrial Safety and\nHealth, Ahmedabad, with a copy to other concerned authorities, sought\npermission to allow women workers to work in night shifts.  However,\nno decision was taken by the concerned authorities on the said\napplication. The petitioners were under a bona\nfide impression that\nthe petitioners can employ women employees beyond 7.00 p.m. and not\nafter 10.00 p.m.  Hence, certain women employees were permitted to\nwork till 8.00 p.m. \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4.5\tOn 20th\nJuly 2012, the officers from the office of the respondent No.3\ninspected the factory premises of the petitioners and it was alleged\nthat the petitioners are permitting women employees to work during\nnight hours. Consequently, a notice dated 7th\nAugust 2012 came to be issued to the petitioners.\n</p> \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_11\">4.6\tThereafter, again on 10th\nSeptember 2012, the officers from the office of the respondent No.3\nvisited the factory and found that certain female workers were\nengaged in the activity of packing of wafers. Therefore, another\nnotice dated 10th\nSeptember 2012 was issued to the petitioners alleging breach of\n<a href=\"/doc/989665/\" id=\"a_12\">section 54</a> of the Act, which prohibits any employer to make any\nemployee work beyond nine hours.  Written explanation in response to\nthe same was sought from the petitioners.  Accordingly, the\npetitioners had submitted their written explanation dated 20th\nSeptember 2012 wherein it was clarified that no employee of the\npetitioners were allowed to work in excess of nine hours.  However,\nit was stated that in the circumstances when the pick-up\ntransportation services arrives late, such employees waiting for the\ntransportation have to wait in the factory premises after their\nworking hours but it does not mean that the petitioners are taking\nwork from  such employees after 5.00 p.m.  \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4.7\tThe explanation was not\naccepted by the respondent No.3, and accordingly, the same was\ncommunicated to the petitioners by the communication dated 27th\nSeptember 2012.  In view of non-acceptance of the explanation and\nalleging breach of <a href=\"/doc/989665/\" id=\"a_13\">section 54</a> of the Act, the respondent No.3 filed\nvarious criminal cases against the concerned persons of the\npetitioner-Company before the Court  of the learned Judicial\nMagistrate, Valsad. \n</p>\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_12\">4.8\tSince the respondents No.2\nand 3 were not taking any decision on various\napplications/representations made by the petitioners to permit women\nemployees in the night shift, ultimately, the petitioners made a\ndetailed representation / application to the respondent No.2 under\n<a href=\"/doc/978206/\" id=\"a_14\">section 66(1) (b)</a> of the Act, specifically requesting the Government\nto issue a notification declaring relaxation in the working hours of\nwomen employees permitting them to work in the night shift.  The\npetitioners had also referred to the notification issued by the\nMadhya Pradesh State.  In addition to the said application, the\npetitioners had also written to the Director, Industrial Safety and\nHealth, Ahmedabad on 9th\nJanuary 2013 contending inter\nalia that with\neffect from 1st\nJanuary 2013, the petitioners are not taking any work from women\nemployees in the night shift and the manufacturing process requires\nabout 200 women employees to work up to 10.00 p.m.   It was,\ntherefore, requested to permit the petitioners to allow women\nemployees to work up to 10.00 p.m. on condition that the petitioners\nwould provide them free transportation and ensure fullest security\nmeasures.\n</p> \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_13\">4.9\tA copy of the application\ndated 9th\nJanuary 2013 given by the petitioners to the respondent No.2 was also\nsent by registered post AD to the respondent No.3 on 18th\nJanuary 2013 and in response thereto, the respondent No.3 called upon\nthe petitioners by communication dated 31st\nJanuary 2013 to submit written consent of such women workers willing\nto work in night shift.  In reply to the said letter, the petitioners\nresponded on 1st\nFebruary 2012 with consent letters of 484 women employees willing to\nwork in night shift and requested the authority to issue a\nnotification at the earliest.\n</p> \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_14\">4.10\tDespite the above facts\nand circumstances and ignoring the willingness of the women employees\nto work in night shift and / or beyond 7.00 p.m., the respondent\nNo.2, by communication dated 1st\nJune 2013 rejected the request of the petitioners for issue of a\nnotification as contemplated under <a href=\"/doc/978206/\" id=\"a_15\">section 66(1)(b)</a> of the Act. The\nsaid decision has been passed, according to the petitioners, without\nrecording any reasons for arriving at it.  None of the\nrepresentations of the petitioners appear to have been considered by\nthe respondent No.2, according to the petitioners.  The Government\nhas, thus, refused to exercise the discretion which it possesses,\nwithout giving any cogent reasons for doing so.  \n</p>\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_15\">4.11\tIn the above situation,\nthe petitioners have approached this Court by way of the present\npetition by contending that the impugned section clearly\ndiscriminates women on the basis of gender and hence, violates the\nvery fundamental rights of women.  It has also been contended that\nthe State Government does have the authority to issue appropriate\nnotification relaxing the timings for female employees; however, none\nof the above contentions are considered by the authorities. \n</p>\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_16\">5.\tIn all\nthese matters, in addition to the notices issued upon the\nrespondents, this Court also directed to issue notice upon the\nlearned Attorney General of India as the prayer was for declaration\nthat <a href=\"/doc/978206/\" id=\"a_16\">section 66(1)(b)</a> of the Act and its proviso are ultra\nvires\nthe Constitution of India.

This violation\ncan, of course, be in different ways e.g. if a State Legislature\nmakes a law which only Parliament can make under Schedule VII List I,\nin which case it will violate <a href=\"/doc/671198/\" id=\"a_101\">Article 246(1)</a> of the Constitution, or\nthe law violates some specific provision of the Constitution (other\nthan the directive principles). But before declaring the statute to\nbe unconstitutional, the Court must be absolutely sure that there can\nbe no manner of doubt that it violates a provision of the\nConstitution. If two views are possible, one making the statute\nconstitutional and the other making it unconstitutional, the former\nview must always be preferred.

Where the validity of a statute is questioned and there\nare two interpretations, one of which would make the law valid and\nthe other void, the former must be preferred and the validity of law\nupheld. In pronouncing on the constitutional validity of a statute,\nthe Court is not concerned with the wisdom or unwisdom, the justice\nor injustice of the law.

As liquor is permitted to be served even in rooms, the\nrestriction would also operate in any of the services including\nhousekeeping where a woman has to enter into a room; the logical\ncorollary of such a wide restriction would be that even if service of\nliquor is made permissible in the flight, the employment of women as\nair-hostesses may be held to be prohibited.\n</blockquote> \n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_115\">24. Hotel Management has\nopened up a viesta of young men and women for employment. A large\nnumber of them are taking hotel management graduation courses. They\npass their examinations at a very young age. If prohibition in\nemployment of women and men below 25 years is to be implemented in\nits letter and spirit, a large section of young graduates who have\nspent a lot of time, money and energy in obtaining the degree or\ndiploma in hotel management would be deprived of their right of\nemployment. Right to be considered for employment subject to just\nexceptions is recognized by <a href=\"/doc/211089/\" id=\"a_148\">Article 16</a> of the Constitution. Right of\nemployment itself may not be a fundamental right but in terms of both\n<a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_149\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/211089/\" id=\"a_150\">16</a> of the Constitution of India, each person\nsimilarly situated has a fundamental right to be considered therefor.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_136\">When a discrimination is sought to be made on the purported ground of\nclassification, such classification must be founded on a rational\ncriteria. The criteria which in absence of any constitutional\nprovision and, it will bear repetition to state, having regard to the\nsocietal conditions as they prevailed in early 20th century, may not\nbe a rational criteria in the 21st century. In the early 20th\ncentury, the hospitality sector was not open to women in general. \nIn the last 60 years, women in India have gained entry in all spheres\nof public life.

Right to Self-Determination is an\nimportant offshoot of Gender Justice discourse. At the same time,\nsecurity and protection to carry out such choice or option\nspecifically, and state of violence-free being generally is another\ntenet of the same movement. In fact, the latter is apparently a more\nbasic value in comparison to right to options in the feminist matrix.\n</blockquote> \n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_118\">34. Privacy rights prescribe\nautonomy to choose profession whereas security concerns texture\nmethodology of delivery of this assurance.

State protection must not translate into\ncensorship.\n</blockquote> \n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_119\">35. At the same time we do\nnot intend to further the rhetoric of empty rights.

In that regard the interference prescribed by State for\npursuing the ends of protection should be proportionate to the\nlegitimate aims.

Professor Williams in\n&quot;The Equality Crisis: Some Reflections on Culture, Courts, and\nFeminism&quot; published in 7 WOMEN&#x27;S RTS. L. REP. 175 (1982) notes\nissues arising where biological distinction between sexes is assessed\nin the backdrop of cultural norms and stereotypes. She characterizes\nthem as &quot;hard cases&quot;. In hard cases, the issue of\nbiological difference between sexes gathers an overtone of societal\nconditions so much so that the real differences are pronounced by the\noppressive cultural norms of the time. This combination of biological\nand social determinants may find expression in popular legislative\nmandate. Such legislations definitely deserve deeper judicial\nscrutiny. It is for the court to review that the majoritarian\nimpulses rooted in moralistic tradition do not impinge upon\nindividual autonomy. This is the backdrop of deeper judicial scrutiny\nof such legislations world over.\n</p> \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_143\">40. Therefore, one issue of\nimmediate relevance in such cases is the effect of the traditional\ncultural norms as also the state of general ambience in the society\nwhich women have to face while opting for an employment which is\notherwise completely innocuous for the male counterpart. In such\ncircumstances the question revolves around the approach of State.\n</p> \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_144\">41. Instead\nof prohibiting women employment in the bars altogether the State\nshould focus on factoring in ways through which unequal consequences\nof sex differences can be eliminated. It is State&#x27;s duty to ensure\ncircumstances of safety which inspire confidence in women to\ndischarge the duty freely in accordance to the requirements of the\nprofession they choose to follow. Any other policy inference (such as\nthe one embodied under <a href=\"/doc/634117/\" id=\"a_154\">section 30</a>) from societal conditions would be\noppressive on the women and against the privacy rights. \n</p> \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_145\">                                            (Emphasis\nsupplied by us).\n</p> \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_146\">15.6\tThe only difference in the\nfacts of the present cases from the one involved in the above\ndecision of the Supreme Court is that in the above case, there was\ntotal prohibition for the entry of the women whereas in the present\ncase, there is prohibition during the nighttime. But the reason in\nboth the cases appears to be the same, for the alleged security of\nthe women. If the total prohibition for the alleged security of the\nwomen is found to be unreasonable by the Supreme Court, for the\nselfsame reason, even the partial prohibition should also be held to\nbe unreasonable encroachment on the fundamental right of women. In\nsuch a situation, it\nis State&#x27;s duty to\nensure circumstances of safety which inspire confidence in women to\ndischarge the duty freely in accordance to the requirements of the\nprofession they choose to follow and\nwith the advent of\nmodern State, new models of security must be developed. There can be\na setting where the cost of security in the establishment can be\ndistributed between the State and the employer as\npointed out by the Supreme Court in the above decision.\n</p> \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_147\">16.\tWe have no doubt in our\nmind that the provision of the Act impugned in these applications has\ndefinitely infringed the fundamental right of a female citizen not\nonly in the matter of equal opportunity of employment but also in\ncarrying on with her own business with the same privileges a male\ncitizen enjoys unless she decides to employ male workmen for the\nnight shift for overcoming the above statutory provision. A female\nowner of a business, howsoever competent and qualified she may be,\neven herself, will not be entitled to supervise the job of either the\nmale workers or the female ones engaged by her during the night shift\nfor the restriction imposed by the <a href=\"/doc/978206/\" id=\"a_155\">Section 66(1) (b)</a> in spite of\nmaking adequate arrangement for her safety and that of her female\nworkers. Even if she decides to employ only the female employees and\nmakes adequate arrangement for safety of her employees in the factory\nand also makes arrangement for transportation of her employees from\ntheir residence to the factory and again back to the residence, law\nwill not permit her to expand her business by introducing night shift\nunless all the employees during that shift happen to be male and she\nentrusts the supervision of her own business to some qualified male\nemployee against her wish.\n</p> \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_148\">17.\tWe also find substance in\nthe contention of the learned counsel for the petitioners that after\nintroduction of sub-sections (2) and (3) of <a href=\"/doc/709777/\" id=\"a_156\">Section 66</a>, the basis of\nthe restriction originally imposed has lost its significance. The\nabove provisions permit participation of the female workers in the\nfactory even during the night shifts for a continuous period of three\nyears at a time if the business happens to be one of fish-curing or\nfish-canning as if in those types of business, there is no necessity\nof the safety and security of the female employees during the night\nshifts.\n</p> \n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_149\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"165408\" id=\"span_29\">18.\tMr. Desai placed strong\nreliance upon a decision of the Supreme Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/165408/\" id=\"a_157\">MANOHAR\nLAL VS.

The\nappellant <a href=\"/doc/165408/\" id=\"a_161\">in that case</a> had chosen Friday as a closed day, i.e. the\nday of the week on which his shop would remain closed. The Inspector\nof Shops and Commercial Establishments, Ferozepore Circle, visited\nthe appellant s shop on Friday, the 29th\nJanuary 1954, and found the shop open and the appellant s son\nselling articles. He was, therefore, prosecuted and ultimately\nconvicted and sentenced by the Additional District Magistrate, which\nwas also confirmed by the High Court of Punjab.  In such context, the\nmatter came up to the Supreme Court.  Before the Supreme Court, the\nlearned advocate for the appellant restricted his attack on one\npoint. He urged that the provision violated the appellant s right\nto carry on his trade or business guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_162\">Article 19(1)(g)</a> and\nthat the restriction imposed was not reasonable within <a href=\"/doc/626103/\" id=\"a_163\">Article 19(6)</a>\nbecause it was not in the interest of the general public. The learned\ncounsel also drew the attention of the Supreme Court to the long\ntitle of the Act reading  <a href=\"/doc/1955064/\" id=\"a_164\">An\nAct</a> to limit the hours of work of Shop Assistants and Commercial\nEmployees and to make certain regulations concerning their holidays,\nWages and terms of service \nand submitted that the insistence on the appellant to close his shop,\nin which there were no  employees , was really outside the\npurview of the legislation and could not be said to sub-serve the\npurpose for which the Act was enacted.  In other words, the\nsubmission of the learned counsel was that the provision for the\ncompulsory closure of his shop for one day in the week served no\ninterests of the general public and that it was unduly and\nunnecessarily restrictive of his freedom to carry on a lawful trade\nor business, otherwise in accordance with law, as he thought best and\nin a manner or mode most convenient or profitable.  The Supreme\nCourt, however, turned down the aforesaid contention after taking\ninto consideration the entire provisions of the Act.  In that\ncontext, the Supreme Court made the following observations in\nparagraphs 5 and 6 of the judgment:</span>\n</p> \n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_125\"> 5. It will be seen that\nwhile under sub-cl. (4) employers are injuncted from employing\npersons who had already worked for the maximum number of permitted\nhours in another establishment, sub-cl. (5) lays an embargo on the\nworker himself from injuring his health by overwork in an endeavour\nto earn more. From this it would be apparent that the Act is\nconcerned-and properly concerned-with the welfare of the worker and\nseeks to prevent injury to it, not merely from the action of the\nemployer but from his own. In other words, the worker is prevented\nfrom attempting to earn more wages by working longer hours than is\ngood for him. If such a condition is necessary or proper in the case\nof a worker, there does not seem to be anything unreasonable in\napplying the same or similar principles to the employer who works on\nhis own business. The learned Judges of the High Court have rested\ntheir decision on this part of the case on the reasoning that the\nterms of the impugned section might be justified on the ground that\nit is designed in the interest of the owner of the shop or\nestablishment himself and that his health and welfare is a matter of\ninterest not only to himself but to the general public. The\nlegislation is in effect the exercise of social control over the\nmanner in which business should be carried on-regulated in the\ninterests of the health and welfare not merely of those employed in\nit but of all those engaged in it. A restriction imposed with a view\nto secure this purpose would, in our opinion, be clearly saved by\n<a href=\"/doc/626103/\" id=\"a_165\">Art. 19(6).</a>\n</blockquote> \n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_126\">6. \tApart from this, the\nconstitutionality of the impugned provision might be sustained on\nanother ground also, viz., with a view to avoid evasion of provisions\nspecifically designed for the protection of workmen employed. It may\nbe pointed out that acts innocent in themselves may be prohibited and\nthe restrictions in that regard would be reasonable, if the same were\nnecessary to secure the efficient enforcement of valid provisions.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_152\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"71082\" id=\"span_32\">The inclusion of a reasonable margin to ensure effective enforcement\nwill not stamp a law otherwise valid as within legislative competence\nwith the character of unconstitutionality as being unreasonable.

Therefore, we do not\naccept the contention of Mr. Gautam Joshi, the learned advocate\nappearing on behalf of the petitioner in one of the matters, that in\nview of <a href=\"/doc/1120284/\" id=\"a_184\">the said decision</a>, there is no scope of even adjudicating the\nabove question at our instance.</span>\n</blockquote> \n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_130\">24.\tWe,\nhowever, respectfully agree with the views taken by the Madras High\nCourt and the Andhra Pradesh High Court that <a href=\"/doc/978206/\" id=\"a_185\">section 66(1) (b)</a> of the\nAct is ultra\nvires\nthe Constitution of India. \n</blockquote>\n \n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_131\">25.\tIn\nview of what have been stated above, we hold that the provisions\ncontained <a href=\"/doc/978206/\" id=\"a_186\">section 66(1)(b)</a> of the Act is ultra\nvires\n<a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_187\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_188\">, 15</a><a href=\"/doc/211089/\" id=\"a_189\">, 16</a>, and <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_190\">19(1)(g)</a> of the Constitution of India.\n</blockquote> \n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_132\">25.1\tWe, however, observe that\nwhile permitting female employees to work during the night shift, it\nwill be a condition precedent upon the employer to make adequate\nmeasures for the safety and security of the female employees who\nwould work during the night shift and the entire provisions of the\nAct including the ones relating to welfare and working hours should\nbe strictly followed even during the night shifts. In addition, it\nwill be also the duty of the employer to make arrangements for\ntransportation of the female employees who work in the night shift\nfrom their respective residence to the factory before the work\ncommences and from the factory to their respective residence after\nthe duty hours of the night shift if the same ends before 6.00 a.m. \nMoreover, as indicated above, the arrangements should also be made\nfor opening adequate medical unit for such female employees and the\nprovision for Cr¿ches as provided for in <a href=\"/doc/1280091/\" id=\"a_191\">section 48</a> of the Act\nshould also be strictly adhered to even during the night-shift.  The\nowners / occupiers of the factories who intend to run night-shift\nwith women workers shall, before starting such shift, inform the\nrespondents in writing of their intention and such night-shift with\nwomen workers shall start only after the authorities of the State\nGovernment, after inspection, is satisfied with the arrangement of\nsafety and security measures  made by the owners / occupiers and even\nafter starting such shifts, if during subsequent inspection any\ndeficiency is found, it will be open to the State Government to  pass\norder stopping such night-shift. \n</blockquote>\n \n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_133\">26.\tWith the above observations\nand directions, these writ-applications are disposed of. In the facts\nof the case, there shall be, however, no order as to costs.\n</blockquote> \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_163\">Sd/-\n</p> \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_164\">(BHASKAR BHATTACHARYA,\nCJ.) \n\n \n\nSd/-\n</p> \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_165\">(J.B.PARDIWALA, J.) \n\n \n\n\nmathew\n \n\n\n\t \n\n\n\tPage\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">\t  64</span>\n\tof   64\n\n\n\n\n</p>","numcites":67,"numcitedby":1,"docsource":"Gujarat High Court","citetid":78049057,"divtype":"judgments","relatedqs":[{"value":"article 19(1)(g)","formInput":"article%2019%281%29%28g%29"},{"value":"right to privacy ","formInput":"right%20to%20privacy%20"},{"value":"gender equality","formInput":"gender%20equality"},{"value":"article 15","formInput":"article%2015"},{"value":"sexual harassment ","formInput":"sexual%20harassment%20"},{"value":"CEDAW","formInput":"CEDAW"},{"value":"all india reporter","formInput":"all%20india%20reporter"},{"value":"human rights","formInput":"human%20rights"},{"value":"article 16","formInput":"article%2016"},{"value":"article 14 and ultra vires","formInput":"article%2014%20and%20ultra%20vires"},{"value":"right to employment","formInput":"right%20to%20employment"},{"value":"article 19","formInput":"article%2019"},{"value":"working women ","formInput":"working%20women%20"},{"value":" discrimination ","formInput":"%20discrimination%20"},{"value":"ultra vires ","formInput":"ultra%20vires%20"},{"value":"constitutional validity","formInput":"constitutional%20validity"},{"value":"provision ultra vires","formInput":"provision%20ultra%20vires"},{"value":"women workers","formInput":"women%20workers"},{"value":"working hours","formInput":"working%20hours"},{"value":"religion","formInput":"religion"}],"cats":[{"value":"equality-before-law","formInput":"tag:equality-before-law"},{"value":"equal-opportunity","formInput":"tag:equal-opportunity"},{"value":"prohibition-of-discrimination","formInput":"tag:prohibition-of-discrimination"},{"value":"women-employment-restrictions-regulations","formInput":"tag:women-employment-restrictions-regulations"},{"value":"right-to-occupation, fundamental-right","formInput":"tag:right-to-occupation, fundamental-right"}],"courtcopy":true,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
