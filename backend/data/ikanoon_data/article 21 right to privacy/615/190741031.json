Similarly, licence is also granted by the local authority\nto petitioner No.2 and the same is subsisting as on date. The\npetitioners have challenged a public notice dated 6.9.2012 at\nAnnexure-B to the petition, whereby the local authority namely Chief\nOfficer, Vapi Nagarpalika on the basis of the circular/communication\ndated 3.9.2012 issued by the State of Gujarat has prohibited sale of\nMaas, Fish and Mutton on account of pious festival of Paryushan. \n</blockquote>\n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">3.2\tSimilarly,\nin Special Civil Application No.12407 of 2012, the petitioner is\nproprietor of the firm and is dealing in the business of Fish at\nGandhidham.

Mr. Girish Patel has vehemently contended that the\nGovernment has no power to issue instructions under the provisions of\nthe <a href=\"/doc/63847194/\" id=\"a_3\">Gujarat Municipalities Act, 1963</a>. Mr. Patel further contended\nthat even if it is presumed that the Government has power to issue\nsuch instructions, the said Municipality has relied upon the same\nwithout any application of mind, only on the basis of the\ninstructions dated 3.9.2012. It is contended that the Municipality\ncannot be permitted to exercise such powers at the dictates of any\nsuperior authority and that the Municipality has given public notice\nwithout any application of mind. Mr. Patel contended that the\nMunicipality has no power to prohibit sale of particular item as it\nhad already given licence to the petitioners and which is valid and\nsubsisting as on date. It is submitted that unless in a situation\nwhere there is violation of any of the conditions of the licence, the\nlicence can be suspended. It is further submitted that the Chief\nOfficer of Municipality has no power to issue such directions and\nimpose restrictions upon the petitioners. \n</p>\n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_7\">6.\tMr.\nPatel contended that the words &quot;Maas Machchhi&quot; does not\ncover &quot;Chicken&quot; and hence, the impugned notices cannot\ninclude the word &quot;Chicken&quot; and therefore, the petitioners\ncannot be prohibited for selling Chicken on the basis of the impugned\nnotices. It is submitted that the impugned notices are violative of\n<a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_4\">Article 19(1)(g)</a> of the Constitution of India as it restricts\nfundamental rights of the petitioners to trade. It is further\nsubmitted that the restrictions imposed upon the petitioners are not\nreasonable restrictions. It is also submitted that the instructions\nare issued without any basis of any law and hence, the impugned\nnotices are ultra vires. It is also contended that the instructions\nare issued on the basis of the judgment of the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court\nwhich does not apply in case of Chicken and no slaughter takes place\nand the Chicken is not cut in a slaughter house. It is also contended\nthat the State Government cannot issue such directions upon feeling\nof one particular religion and stop business of the petitioners in a\nsecular state which is one of the basic structure of the\nConstitution. \n</p>\n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_8\">7.\tMr.\nSandip M. Patel, learned advocate for the petitioner in Special Civil\nApplication No.12407 of 2012 has adopted the arguments made by Mr.\nGirish Patel, learned Senior Advocate for the petitioners in Special\nCivil Application No.12397 of 2012. Mr. Patel further contended that\nthe impugned notices are ex-facie, bad and illegal and are being\nimplemented to the knowledge of the petitioners only in the town of\nGandhidham, whereas in the other towns, the business of Fish is not\nprohibited even though as per the instructions dated 3.9.2012 all\nMunicipalities have been directed by the Director of Municipalities\non the basis of the instructions from the State Government. He,\ntherefore, submitted that the impugned notices are bad in law,\ndiscriminatory and violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_5\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of\nIndia. \n</p>\n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">8.\tThe\nlearned counsel for the petitioners in both the matters submitted\nthat the reliance put forward by the Government on the judgment of\nthe Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court is totally erroneous as the said judgment\ndeals with the slaughter of other animals which were prohibited\nduring Paryushan period, whereas in both the petitions, Chicken and\nFish are not slaughtered in slaughter house, but are sold in the open\nmarket. \n</p>\n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_10\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"560071\" id=\"span_1\">9.\tAs\nagainst this, Ms. Nisha M.

Thakore, learned AGP submitted that no\nfundamental rights or legal rights of the petitioners are violated\nwhich calls for interference by this Court in its writ jurisdiction.\nMs. Nisha M. Thakore, learned AGP submitted that the instructions\nhave been issued by the State Government and the same is communicated\nto all the local authorities by the Director of Municipality vide its\ninstructions dated 3.9.2012 and various Municipalities and\nNagarpalika as well as rural areas are informed to close the shops\nduring pious festival of Paryushan observed by Jain community during\n12.9.2012 to 19.9.2012. The learned AGP further submitted that such\ninstructions are issued in terms of the order passed by the Hon&#x27;ble\nApex Court in its judgment and order dated 30.8.2005 passed in SLP\nNo.11810 - 11812 of 2005 as well as Civil Appeal No.5472 of\n2005 dated 24.3.2008. The learned AGP submitted that the restrictions\nimposed are only for a particular period and therefore, there are no\ninstructions resulting into violation of fundamental rights of the\npetitioners. The learned AGP further submitted that the instructions\nissued are in form of a request to the authorities to close the\nslaughter house as well as sell of Maas, Machchhi and Mutton during\nthe pious festival of Paryushan. The learned AGP relied upon the\nratio laid down by the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/560071/\" id=\"a_6\">Hinsa\nVirodhak Sangh Vs.

Poultry also includes other birds which\nare killed for their meat, such as pigeons or doves or birds\nconsidered to be game, such as pheasants.

Most fish are ectothermic\n(&quot;cold-blodded&quot;), allowing their body temperatures to\nvary as ambient temperatures change, though some of the large active\nswimmers like white shark and tuna can hold a higher core\ntemperature. Fish are abundant in most bodies of water. They can be\nfound in nearly all aquatic environments, from high mountain streams\n(e.g., char and gudgeon) to the abyssal and even hadal depths of the\ndeepest oceans (e.g., gulpers and anglerfish).

In the aforesaid case, the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court\nhas examined the similar restrictions which were imposed by way of\nresolutions passed by the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation for closure\nof Municipal slaughter house in Ahmedabad during Paryushan festival.\nSuch resolutions were passed under <a href=\"/doc/173116895/\" id=\"a_11\">Sections 466(1)(D)(b)</a> of the\nBombay Provincial Municipal Corporations Act, 1949. The Hon&#x27;ble Apex\nCourt, while considering the aforesaid resolutions, observed thus:-</span> \n</p>\n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">&quot;27.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">Had the impugned resolutions ordered closure of municipal slaughter\nhouses for a considerable period of time we may have held the\nimpugned resolutions to be invalid being an excessive restriction on\nthe rights of the butchers of Ahmedabad who practise their profession\nof meat selling. After all, butchers are practising a trade and it is\ntheir fundamental right under <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_12\">Article 19(1)(g)</a> of the Constitution\nwhich is guaranteed to all citizens of India. Moreover, it is not a\nmatter of the proprietor of the butchery shop alone. There may be\nalso several workmen therein who may become unemployed if the\nslaughter houses are closed for a considerable period of time,\nbecause one of the conditions of the licence given to the shop-owners\nis to supply meat regularly in the city of Ahmedabad and this supply\ncomes from the municipal slaughter houses of Ahmedabad. Also, a large\nnumber of people are non-vegetarian and they cannot be compelled to\nbecome vegetarian for a long period. What one eats is one&#x27;s personal\naffair and it is a part of his right to privacy which is included in\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_13\">Article 21</a> of our Constitution as held by several decisions of this\nCourt. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"501107\" id=\"span_4\">In <a href=\"/doc/501107/\" id=\"a_14\">R.

We have,\ntherefore, to take a balanced view of the matter.\n</blockquote> \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">29.\nIn this connection it may be mentioned that there is a large\npopulation of the Jain community in the States of Rajasthan and\nGujarat. The Jains have a religious festival called Paryushan during\nwhich they do penance. Out of respect, for their sentiments surely\nthe non-vegetarians can remain vegetarians for 9 days in a year.\n</blockquote> \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">30.\nMr. Soli Sorabjee, learned senior counsel for one the appellants\nsubmitted that even non-vegetarians can get meat from other cities of\nGujarat or from other States during these 9 days period of Paryushan\nand they will not be compelled to become vegetarians. Learned counsel\nsubmitted that it is only the municipal slaughter houses which are\nclosed for 9 days, but there is no ban on eating meat during those 9\ndays which can easily be procured from outside. We do not agree.\n</blockquote> \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">31.\nWe have to take a practical view of the matter. Most people do not\nhave the money to purchase meat from other cities or other States and\nbring it to Ahmedabad. Almost all meat eaters get their meat from the\nlocal butcher shop in the city, usually from a shop which is close to\ntheir residence. Hence, closure of the slaughter house, in substance,\nmeans compelling the non-vegetarians to become vegetarians for 9\ndays.\n</blockquote> \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">32.\nHowever, we agree with Mr. Sorabjee that the restriction is only a\npartial restriction for a limited period, and it is not\ndisproportionate. Hence it is not an unreasonable restriction.\n</blockquote> \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">33.\nWhile it is true that the fundamental right of the writ petitioners\nunder <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_16\">Article 19(1)(g)</a> is affected by the impugned resolutions of the\nMunicipal Corporation, we have further to examine whether the\nresolutions are saved by <a href=\"/doc/626103/\" id=\"a_17\">Article 19(6)</a> which states that reasonable\nrestrictions can be put on the right to freedom of trade and\noccupation under <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_18\">Article 19(1)(g)</a> of the Constitution.\n</blockquote> \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">34.\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"554839\" id=\"span_5\">In this connection, we may now refer to the well known Constitution\nBench decision of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/554839/\" id=\"a_19\">State of Madras vs. V.G. Row</a>, 1952\nSCR 597, where this Court observed that while determining the\nreasonable restriction, the Court should consider not only the\nfactors of the restriction such as the duration and the extent but\nalso the circumstances and the manner in which the imposition has\nbeen authorized. The Court further observed : (AIR p.200, para 15)\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n&quot;15.</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">... It is important in this context to bear in mind that the test of\nreasonableness, wherever prescribed, should be applied to each\nindividual statute impugned, and no abstract standard, or general\npattern of reasonableness can be laid down as applicable to all\ncases. The nature of the right alleged to have been infringed, the\nunderlying purpose of the restrictions imposed, the extent and\nurgency of the evil sought to be remedied thereby, the disproportion\nof the imposition, the prevailing conditions at the time, should all\nenter into the judicial verdict. In evaluating such elusive factors\nand forming their own conception of what is reasonable, in all the\ncircumstances of a given case, it is inevitable that the social\nphilosophy and the scale of values of the Judges participating in the\ndecision should play an Important part, and the limit to their\ninterference with legislative judgment in such cases can only be\ndictated by their sense of responsibility and self-restraint and the\nsobering reflection that the Constitution is meant not only for\npeople of their way of thinking but for all, and that the majority of\nthe elected representatives of the people have, in authorising the\nimposition of the restrictions, considered them to be reasonable.&quot;\n</blockquote> \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_20\">The\naforesaid observations have become locus classicus. In the present\ncase we have noticed that the closure of the slaughter house is only\nfor 9 days and not for a considerable period of time. This decision\nindicates that the restriction is reasonable. A period of 9 days is a\nvery short time and surely the non-vegetarians can become vegetarians\nduring those 9 days out of respect for the feeling of the Jain\ncommunity. Also, the dealers in meat can do their business for 356\ndays in a year, and they have to abstain from it for only 9 days in a\nyear. Surely this is not an excessive restriction, particularly since\nsuch closure has been observed for many years.\n</p> \n\n \n\n\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_21\">40.\nIn the present case, we do not find any clear violation of any\nconstitutional provision by the impugned resolutions. As already\nstated above, had the closure of the slaughter houses been ordered\nfor a considerable period of time, we would have declared it to be\nunconstitutional on the ground of violation of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_20\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_21\">, 19(1)(g)</a>\nas well as 21 of the Constitution. However, in the present case, the\nclosure is only for a few days and has been done out of respect for\nthe sentiments of the Jain community which has a large population in\nGujarat.

Before\nthe coming of modern industry there were agricultural societies and\nIndia was a paradise for these because agriculture requires level\nland, fertile soil, plenty of water for irrigation etc. which was in\nabundance in India. Why would anybody living in India migrate to\nAfganistan which has a harsh terrain, rocky and mountainous and\ncovered with snow for several months in a year when one cannot grow\nany crop? Hence, almost all migrations and invasions came from\noutside into India (except in recent times when some people have gone\nto other countries for job opportunities). Most of the\nmigrations/invasions came from the North-West, and to a much lesser\nextent from the North-East of India. Thus, people kept pouring into\nIndia, and it is for this reason that there is so much diversity in\nIndia.\n</blockquote> \n\n \n\n\n \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">44.\nAs the great Urdu poet Firaq Gorakhpuri wrote :\n</blockquote> \n\n \n\n\n \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">...\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">... ... ... \n</blockquote>\n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">Which\nmeans -\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">&quot;In\nthe land of Hind, the Caravans of the peoples of the world kept\ncoming in and India kept getting formed.&quot;\n</blockquote> \n\n \n\n\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_25\">45.\nSince India is a country of great diversity, it is absolutely\nessential if we wish to keep our country united to have tolerance and\nrespect for all communities and sects.
