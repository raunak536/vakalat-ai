The case of the petitioner is that she is prosecuting 1st\n\nSemester 4th year in Civil Engineering Branch in the first\n\nrespondent college. Due to advanced pregnancy, the petitioner\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                  2</span>\n\n\n\ndid not attend college from 10.10.2021 to 26.11.2021.        After\n\ndelivering baby on 11.11.2021, she attended college after gap\n\nof 15 days. While the matter stood thus, the first respondent\n\nincluded the name of the petitioner in the list of detained\n\npersons as she was having shortage of attendance i.e., 52%\n\ninstead of 65% and placed the said list in the notice board on\n\n06.01.2022, asking them to submit their explanations within\n\ntwo days. Thereafter, the first respondent published the final\n\nlist without hearing the objections of the petitioner . Thereafter,\n\nthe petitioner made representation on 07.01.2022 to the first\n\nrespondent explaining the reasons for not attending classes\n\nfrom 10.10.201 to 26.11.2021. But, the first respondent\n\nrefused to consider the representation of the petitioner.\n\nTherefore, she was not permitted to appear in the 4th year 1st\n\nsemester and lab exams. Aggrieved by the action of the first\n\nrespondent in detaining and not permitting the petitioner for\n\nthe examinations, the petitioner filed the present writ petition.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                3</span>\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">3.   The first respondent filed counter affidavit contending that\n\npetitioner has secured only 52.83% of overall/cumulative\n\nattendance against 75% of the attendance stipulated for\n\npermitting the student to appear for final examinations. As per\n\n<a href=\"/doc/85782/\" id=\"a_5\">Regulation 6</a>.3 of the Academic Regulations, shortage of\n\nattendance below 65% in aggregate shall in no case be\n\ncondoned. The overall attendance secured by the petitioner is\n\n52.83, which is 22.17% less than 75%. On medical grounds,\n\nthe petitioner was granted 10% condonation of shortage of\n\nattendance. Even after 10% of condonation of shortage of\n\nattendance also, the petitioner has shortage of attendance by\n\n12.17% to appear for the examinations and hence, she was\n\ndetained as per the Regulations. In AICTE Circular F.No.2-\n\nPC/AICTE/Gen.Dist.Edu.Policy/2018 dated 10.09.2018, there is\n\nno mention about the maternity leave to be granted to the\n\nwomen students pursuing UG courses. UGC Circular No. DO\n\nNo.21-116/2021 (CPP-II), dated 14.12.2021 is in relation to M.\n\nPhil/Ph.D., candidates, but not in relation to undergraduate\n\ncourses. As per AICTE rules, a student pursuing B.Tech has to\n\nattend classes regularly and has to secure at least 75% of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                  4</span>\n\n\n\nattendance. The Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court in catena of occasions held\n\nthat the academic regulations prescribed by the expert bodies\n\ncannot be diluted so as to meet the requirements of an\n\nindividual. As there was no norms to consider the stortage of\n\nattendance less than 65% and as the petitioner has secured\n\n52.83% aggregate attendance, she was detained and not\n\npermitted to appear IV year I Semester end lab examinations\n\nas per the JNTUA and college norms. The academic calendar for\n\nthe   IV   B.Tech   I-Semester       was    displayed   before   the\n\ncommencement of the semester and there is no hard and fast\n\nrule that the semester has to be spread in the entire six months\n\nas mentioned by the petitioner.            The semester is to be\n\nconducted in 90 working days and as per the calendar, the\n\nstipulation is satisfied. Therefore, the circulars issued by the\n\nAICTE and UGC are not applicable in the case of the Petitioner.\n\nFurther, the provision of Conventions for Eliminating of all\n\nForms of Discrimination against to Women (CEDAW) is also not\n\napplicable in the present facts of the case. Therefore, the\n\npetitioner can be re-admitted into the same semester and\n\npursue the course by possessing required attendance, but she\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                  5</span>\n\n\n\ncannot claim equities by grossly violating the mandatory\n\nrequirements and requested to dismiss the writ petition.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_4\">4.   Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and the learned\n\ncounsel for the respondents.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_5\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_6\">5.   Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that though the\n\n1st respondent granted two days time to submit explanation,\n\nwithout considering the explanation of the petitioner, published\n\nthe list of the detained persons. On 07.01.2022, the petitioner\n\nsubmitted    representation    explaining   the   reasons   for   not\n\nattending the classes from 10.10.2021 to 26.11.2021 along\n\nwith medical certificates and bills, the 1st respondent refused to\n\nconsider the representation of the petitioner. The only reason\n\nfor less attendance is that she was in advanced stage of\n\npregnancy. Though the gap between each semester shall be 6\n\nmonths,     the first respondent conducted classes for the 7th\n\nsemester i.e 4th year 1st part from 06.09.2021 to 31.12.2021\n\nwithin a period of three months and if classes were conducted\n\nfor the entire 6 months period, the petitioner would have met\n\nwith the minimum required percentage i.e., 65%.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                               6</span>\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_7\">6.        The learned counsel for the petitioner has relied on\n\nseveral judgments of various High Courts and the Apex Court.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">7.      In Ankita Meena V University of Delhi1, the petitioner\n\njoined 3 year LLB Course at Law Centre-II, Faculty of Law,\n\nUniversity of Delhi in August, 2016. By the time she joined the\n\ncourse she was already married for about five months. The\n\npetitioner        completed        the    first   3   semesters   without   any\n\nhindarance. However, she fell short of the required attendance\n\nduring the 4th semester due to two difficulties.                  One was that\n\nshe gave birth to a baby on 22.02.2018 disabling her to attend\n\nthe classes till the end of March, 2018 and the second difficulty\n\nwas that the Delhi University Teacher&#x27;s Association went on a\n\nstrike from 16.03.2018 and hence, the University could not\n\nconduct the minimum number of classes as prescribed by Rule\n\n10 of the Bar Counsel of India Rules. Therefore, the petitioner\n\nwas detailed by a Notice dated 09.05.2018 and not permitted\n\nto write the 4th Semester Examinations scheduled to commence\n\nfrom 12.05.2018. The Petitioner filed WP (Civil) No.5194 of\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">1</span>\n    2021 (1) ESC 174 (SC)/MANU/SC/0037/2021\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                           7</span>\n\n\n\n2018 before the High Court of Delhi seeking a direction to the\n\nuniversity        to   permit   to    appear     for   the     4th   semester\n\nexaminations, but the said Writ Petition was dismissed by an\n\nOrder dated 15.05.2018. An intra appeal was filed by the\n\npetitioner in LPA No.294 of 2018 and the same was dismissed\n\nby      the    Division   Bench      by   an   Order   dated     07.09.2018.\n\nThereafter, the petitioner therein filed SLP before the Hon&#x27;ble\n\nApex Court and the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court permitted the petitioner\n\ntherein to appear in the semester examination on the ground\n\nthat she was also carrying baby.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_9\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\">8. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"440934\" id=\"span_8\">In <a href=\"/doc/440934/\" id=\"a_6\">Nithya v University of Madras</a> and others2, the\n\nMadras High Court allowed the petitioner therein to appear in\n\nthe examinations as the petitioner fell short of attendance due\n\nto delivery of a child.

It is\n  important to     recognise   that reproductive   choices can be\n  exercised to procreate as well as to abstain from procreating.\n  The crucial consideration is that a woman&#x27;s right to privacy,\n  dignity and bodily integrity should be respected. This means\n  that there should be no restriction whatsoever on the exercise\n  of reproductive choices such as a woman&#x27;s right to refuse\n  participation in sexual activity or alternatively the insistence on\n  use of contraceptive methods. Furthermore, women are also\n  free to choose birth-control methods such as undergoing\n  sterilisation procedures. Taken to their logical conclusion,\n  reproductive rights include a woman&#x27;s entitlement to carry a\n  pregnancy to its full term, to give birth and to subsequently\n  raise children....&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\">  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"440934\" id=\"span_17\">48.

Learned counsel for the first respondent, University of\n  Madras submitted that as per the attendance regulation\n  applicable to the petitioner even if 50% of attendance is\n  condoned as the rule stands, she has to appear for the next\n  September or subsequent University examination by paying\n  the prescribed condonation fee without putting in further\n  attendance. There is force in the contention of Miss K.\n  Geetha, learned counsel appearing for the respondent that\n  as the rule stands the University is bound by the said\n  regulations. However, in the instant case, it is clear that\n  the petitioner during the last course of her academic year\n  for B.A. Corporate Secretaryship was married on 18-10-\n  1993 and she was conceived shortly thereafter and as a\n  result she was suffering from morning sick- ness and other\n  indispositions and, therefore, she was not in a position to\n  attend the classes regularly. The reasons given by the\n  petitioner for not attending the classes have to be accepted\n  as they are genuine and natural consequences of married\n  life. However, there is an impediment as far as University is\n  concerned as long as <a href=\"/doc/176303/\" id=\"a_15\">Regulation 2(ii)</a> is there. Taking into\n  the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case, I feel that\n  it is a fit case to give an exemption from the operation of\n  the said rule as the petitioner has completed 55.75% of\n  attendance and as such she is entitled to condonations of\n  attendance by paying necessary condonation fee to the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                                    11</span>\n\n\n\n      University. In this connection it is observed that as large\n      number of women students are joining University courses\n      and the type of situation in which the petitioner was\n      involved viz., she was married, may also occur in case of\n      any woman students. The directive principles of State\n      policy contain in parly IV of our Constitution by <a href=\"/doc/1975922/\" id=\"a_16\">Art. 41</a> says\n      that the State shall, within the limits of its economic\n      capacity, make of active provision for secur ing education.\n      If equal opportunity is given to women for education, they\n      can stand on equal terms with men. <a href=\"/doc/111604/\" id=\"a_17\">Article 42</a> the Directive\n      Principles of State Policy says that the State shall make\n      provision for securing just and humane conditions of work\n      and for maternity relief. Maternity relief in case of girl\n      student will include leave. The University of Madras, a\n      creature of statute can make provisions for granting leave\n      to girl students, if they get married during the period of\n      study and lose their minimum attendance. It is high time\n      that the regulations that have been framed by the\n      University are modified taking into consideration such\n      situations where women student are married during the\n      last course of their academic career and due to pregnancy\n      they may not be in position to attend and complete the\n      course.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_17\">11.    In view of the above settled legal position, in our\n\nview, a female student like the petitioner cannot be\n\ndeprived for student status or she cannot be detained in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                                12</span>\n\n\n\nany examinations/semesters due to the fact that she could\n\nnot attend the classes because of her pregnancy.
