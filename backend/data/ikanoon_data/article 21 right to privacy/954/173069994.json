The issue, although,\n\nrelates to the medical termination of pregnancy of a minor girl beyond\n\nthe legally permissible gestation period of 20 weeks but other issues\n\nsuch as right to life, health and abortion (which includes victim-mother\n\nand the foetus), human rights and issues of social and religious concerns\n\n\n\n\n                                      1 of 87\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                  ::: Downloaded on - 01-06-2016 00:11:10 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                                                   2</span>\nCWP-6733-2016\n\n\nare involved.

Petitioner No. 2 and other family members also went to sleep. In\n\nthe morning, when they woke up, his daughter was not in the house.\n\nThey searched for her, but could not find her anywhere. They also\n\ninquired about her from Urmila and her mother, but they did not get any\n\ninformation regarding whereabouts of their daughter from them. They\n\nhad suspicion that she had been got kidnapped by Urmila. On the basis\n\nof complaint made by petitioner No. 2, an FIR No.20 dated 04.03.2016,\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/886598/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 365</a> of IPC was registered at Women Police Station at\n\nNuh.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">5.

She was\n\nproduced before the Medical Officer at Government Medical College,\n\nNalhar, Nuh. Petitioner No. 1 declined to get herself medico-legally\n\nexamined.

Averments in writ petition\n\n            Petitioner No.2 has filed this writ petition being father and\n\nnatural guardian of petitioner No. 1. It is averred that the Investigating\n\nOfficer in connivance with the accused put pressure upon minor girl and\n\ngot her statement recorded under threat before the Judicial Magistrate 1st\n\nClass, Mewat. The Court sent her (minor) to Nari Niketan, Karnal.\n\nPetitioner No. 1 while staying in Nari Niketan sent an application to the\n\nJudicial Magistrate 1st Class, Mewat showing her willingness to stay\n\nwith her parents. On 09.03.2016, petitioner no. 2 filed an application for\n\nissuance of production warrant of petitioner No.1 before the Court, who\n\nordered handing over her custody to her parents.                On 10.03.2016,\n\npetitioner No.1 narrated the entire story to her parents and disclosed that\n\nrespondent No.8 had committed rape upon her in October, 2015 by\n\nputting her under threat. He also prepared her obscene video-clip and\n\nunder the garb of the same, he exploited her and committed rape upon\n\nher many a time. Petitioner No.1 was forcibly kidnapped on 29.02.2016.\n\nThe alleged offences were committed by accused-respondent No. 8 and\n\nhis associates.

On 16.03.2016, the Judicial\n\nMagistrate Ist Class directed the investigating officer to get petitioner\n\nNo.1 medico-legally examined. She was examined at Civil Hospital-\n\ncum-SHKM Government Medical College, Nalhar. The medical\n\nexamination of petitioner No.1 was not conducted properly and no\n\npregnancy test was conducted in spite of the fact that the doctor of Civil\n\nHospital-cum-SHKM Government Medical College, Nalhar was made\n\naware of the alleged rape committed upon petitioner No.1. The\n\ninvestigating officer also did not act in a fair manner. The petitioners\n\nmet the senior police officials but no one paid any heed to their\n\ngrievance. Representations were also given to Director General of Police\n\nHaryana and Inspector General of police for protecting the life of\n\npetitioners and their family members at the hands of the accused and his\n\nassociates.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">7.

Punhana\n\nand was taken to Civil Hospital-cum-SHKM Government Medical\n\nCollege, Nalhar for medico-legal examination. Initially, she refused to\n\nget herself medico-legally examined.        She was produced before the\n\nCourt and her statement under <a href=\"/doc/497457/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 164</a> Cr.P.C. was recorded wherein\n\nshe stated that she had gone with accused-Mubarik at her own sweet will\n\nand was not kidnapped and allured.

Submissions made by learned Counsel for petitioners:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">              Mr. Gopal Sharma, learned counsel for the petitioners\n\nvehemently contended that the police officials have not discharged their\n\nduty with due diligence and faithfully, rather they connived with the\n\naccused persons. The investigating officer helped the accused out of\n\nway and her statement under <a href=\"/doc/497457/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 164</a> Cr.P.C. was got recorded under\n\nthreat. Petitioner No.1 was not got medico-legally examined and her\n\nsignatures were obtained to show that she had declined to get herself\n\nmedico-legally examined. He further contended that she was always\n\nready and willing for her medico-legal examination and wanted\n\ntermination of her pregnancy.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\">10.

As there cannot be any termination of pregnancy without the\n\nexpress and voluntary consent of the woman, in the same manner the\n\npregnancy should not be forced to be continued without her voluntary\n\nconsent, especially when the facts of the case show that the very act\n\nwhich led to the conception was an involuntary act. No doubt, the\n\n\n\n                                  6 of 87\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                ::: Downloaded on - 01-06-2016 00:11:11 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                                                     7</span>\nCWP-6733-2016\n\n\nprotection of right of unborn child is an obligation cast upon the State\n\nunder the Constitutional provisions, yet in view of the unambiguous\n\nlanguage of <a href=\"/doc/1891528/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 5</a> of the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act,\n\n1971 (for brevity, &#x27;<a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_7\">MTP Act</a>&#x27;), the conflict between the right to life of\n\nmother and the right to life of unborn child would yield in favour of the\n\nright to life of mother. To force a woman to continue with the pregnancy\n\nwhich she does not want to continue is an infringement of right to\n\nprivacy and dignity of the woman as well as an infringement of the right\n\nto a healthy and dignified life of the nascent life in her womb.\n\n10.2         Learned amicus curiae submitted further that the facts of the\n\npresent case reveal that the choice available to the Petitioner No. 1 under\n\nthe provisions of the law was snatched away from her due to the\n\nignorance exhibited by the medical experts, lawyers and investigating\n\nofficers at the relevant stages. Petitioner No. 1 is beseeching to terminate\n\nthe pregnancy, she does not want to carry, but she is being denied this\n\nbecause of a helpless exercise only on account of gestation period of\n\npregnancy running beyond 20 weeks. Learned amicus curiae further\n\ncontended    that   in   the   last   one   year,   two      reported   judicial\n\npronouncements, one by the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court and another by the\n\nHon&#x27;ble Gujarat High Court, lifted the bar contained under <a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 3</a> of\n\nMTP Act in the similar circumstances but in the present case the same\n\ncould not be done as the required assistance and co-operation did not\n\ncome forth from the medical experts as happened in the two cases came\n\nbefore the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court and Hon&#x27;ble Gujarat High Court.\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_13\">                                  7 of 87\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">               ::: Downloaded on - 01-06-2016 00:11:11 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                                                                8</span>\nCWP-6733-2016\n\n\n10.3         Ms. Bedi further submitted that she has personally talked to\n\npetitioner No.1 in camera and has placed on record of this court the\n\nconversation in compact disc., she had with petitioner No.1. The law\n\npermits abortion legally if the pregnancy is the result of crime. Ms. Bedi\n\nmade reference to <a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_9\">Sections 3</a> to <a href=\"/doc/1891528/\" id=\"a_10\">5</a> of the MTP Act. <a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 3</a> of the Act\n\nrequires\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_14\">       a).   permission of one doctor if pregnancy is less than 12 weeks\n             and\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_15\">       b).   permission of minimum of 2 doctors if the pregnancy is\n             more than 12 weeks but less than 20 weeks gestation period;\n\nto opine and carry out termination of pregnancy. <a href=\"/doc/1891528/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 5</a> of the MTP\n\nAct carves out an exception for carrying out termination of pregnancy\n\nrequired immediately to save the life of a pregnant woman irrespective\n\nof the length of pregnancy.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_16\">10.4         Learned amicus curiae made reference to the provisions of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_13\">MTP Act</a> that registered medical officers are required to understand the\n\nspirit behind the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_14\">MTP Act</a> lifting the embargo on\n\ntermination of pregnancy beyond 20 weeks in cases as contemplated\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1891528/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 5</a> of the MTP Act. The opinion mentioned therein can be\n\nformed by a single doctor also. She further contended that expertise of\n\nthe doctors is to take precedence over every thing which includes the\n\njudgment of the Court. She contended that the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_16\">MTP Act</a> do\n\nnot contemplate authorization or approval from any court. In fact,\n\nwhenever a matter concerning medical termination of pregnancy on any\n\nground whatsoever comes before the courts, the courts have invariably\n\n\n\n\n                                 8 of 87\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">               ::: Downloaded on - 01-06-2016 00:11:11 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                                                                 9</span>\nCWP-6733-2016\n\n\nbased their decision on the opinion of the medical board. There is not a\n\nsingle instance found where the Courts have given directions against the\n\nconclusions drawn by the medical board. In fact, the very exercise of\n\napproaching the courts in such situations results in unnecessary wastage\n\nof time and, many a times, renders the remedy sought unavailable to the\n\nvictim.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">10.5        In support of her contentions, Ms. Bedi has relied upon\n\nfollowing judgments:\n</p>\n<pre id=\"pre_2\">            (i)       Roe vs. Wade 35 L Ed 2d 147 : 410 US 113\n                      (1973);\n\n            (ii)      Suchita Srivastava and another vs. Chandigarh\n                      Administration AIR 2010 SC 235;\n\n            (iii)     Kavita vs. State of Haryana and others 2015 (2)\n                      RCR (Criminal) 606 (P &amp; H);\n\n            (iv)      Minor daughter of Sh.

Petitioner No. 1 has told\n\nthe learned amicus curiae that she was under pressure as a result of\n\nwhich she refused to get herself medically examined at the first stage,\n\nwhen she was recovered and produced before the doctor. Subsequently\n\nby moving an application on 14.03.2016, the victim sought to get herself\n\nexamined by medical officer for the alleged crime of rape. Petitioner No.\n\n1 was examined by the Medical Officer on 16.03.2016, but there is no\n\nreference to the pregnancy of petitioner No.1 in the MLR and even no\n\ntests were conducted to ascertain the pregnancy. In fact, a bare perusal of\n\nthis document will show that the medical examination was conducted in\n\nthe most irresponsible manner. The precious time was lost due to delay.\n\nAs the pregnancy is the result of rape and petitioner No. 1 is anguished\n\ndue to such pregnancy, the termination could have been done by the\n\nmedical officers of Civil Hospital-cum-SHKM Government Medical\n\nCollege, Nalhar, Nuh. No permission was required from the court and\n\nonly consent of the minor-victim and her guardian, as required under\n\n\n\n                                 10 of 87\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">               ::: Downloaded on - 01-06-2016 00:11:11 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">                                                                  11</span>\nCWP-6733-2016\n\n\nlaw, was needed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_30\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"175763450\" id=\"span_24\">10.7         Ms. Bedi has relied upon <a href=\"/doc/175763450/\" id=\"a_21\">Bashir Khan</a>&#x27;s case (supra) and\n\nVijender&#x27;s case (supra) wherein the issue of wastage of time in\n\napproaching the court has been examined and the importance of consent\n\nof minor with regard to termination of her pregnancy is mentioned.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"175763450\" id=\"span_25\">For\n\nthe purpose of requirement of minor&#x27;s consent in addition to the consent\n\nof legal guardians, the reliance is also placed on the judgment of the\n\nDivision Bench of the Madras High Court titled as <a href=\"/doc/175763450/\" id=\"a_22\">V.

As the time is\n\nthe essence of availing the remedy of medical termination of pregnancy\n\nin the exigent situations, the importance of availing the same should be\n\ncommunicated to the victim and her family members immediately. It was\n\nsubmitted that the lawyers must eschew from filing the unnecessary\n\napplications for seeking medical termination of pregnancy within 20\n\nweeks of gestation period and should guide their clients accordingly. It\n\nwas further argued by her that as mentioned in the judgments passed by\n\nthis Court in the case of case <a href=\"/doc/175763450/\" id=\"a_23\">Bashir Khan</a>&#x27;s case (supra) and Vijender&#x27;s\n\ncase (supra), the judicial officers should be proactive and in the\n\neventuality of filing of such applications instead of technical dismissal of\n\nthe same, plea of the woman should be forwarded to the medical board\n\nfor an appropriate action immediately.

The general guidelines are required to be issued by this court\n\nto all the concerned in such cases for the submissions made hereinabove.\n\n10.9        Ms. Tanu Bedi made reference to the conversation which\n\nshe had with the victim. During the conversation, the victim vehemently\n\ninsisted on committing suicide in-case pregnancy is not terminated. The\n\nvictim&#x27;s unequivocal rejection of the child in her womb, and her threat to\n\ncommit suicide if she&#x27;s forced to carry on with the pregnancy is a serious\n\nissue. The peculiar situation warrants the consideration of the same\n\nunder the language of the statute, namely <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_24\">MTP Act</a>, as contained in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1891528/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 5</a> of the Act which unambiguously gives power to the doctor to\n\ncarry out medical termination of pregnancy, unfettered by any legal bars,\n\nto save the life of victim/woman.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_32\">10.10       Ms. Bedi further made reference to the orders dated\n\n23.04.2016, 02.05.2016 and 13.05.2016 and report of the Medical Board\n\nof the Civil Hospital-cum-SHKM Government Medical College, Nalhar,\n\nNuh dated 26.04.2016 and the reports of the Medical Board of\n\nPGIMER, Chandigarh, dated 04.05.2016 and 14.05.2016. It was\n\nsubmitted by Ms. Bedi that the juxtaposition of the orders of the Hon&#x27;ble\n\nCourt with the reports of the medical boards would show an unfortunate\n\nabsence of required ingenuity and gumption on the part of the medical\n\nexperts to understand the spirit and import of the order in the\n\n\n\n\n                                 12 of 87\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">               ::: Downloaded on - 01-06-2016 00:11:11 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">                                                                  13</span>\nCWP-6733-2016\n\n\nbackground of peculiar circumstances in which they were passed. The\n\nlearned amicus curiae has implored to refer the matter to AIIMS, New\n\nDelhi for an opinion by the experts in the field in the nature of\n\npossibility of termination in view of threat of suicide by the victim; the\n\npossibility of premature delivery as the foetus is reportedly stated to be\n\nviable (reliance was placed on a news item which showed that recently\n\nin Ireland, a country which bans abortion completely, a teenager\n\npregnant due to rape, who could not be allowed permission for abortion,\n\nwas helped by the doctors during the 26th week of gestation period by\n\ndelivering the child prematurely through C-Section, and relieving her of\n\nthe burden of carrying the pregnancy to its full term). She has further\n\ndrawn the attention of the court to the laws relating to medical\n\ntermination of pregnancy in other countries and submitted that in\n\ncountries like Canada, China, and North Korea, there is no upper limit of\n\ngestation period within which the termination of pregnancy can be\n\nlegally sought by a woman. It was also submitted that in the eventuality\n\nof both the options being ruled out by the team of medical experts, the\n\nvictim should be counselled regularly, in addition to giving her the best\n\npre-natal care. If it is found by the experts that in any circumstance,\n\npetitioner No. 1 is not ready to keep the child with her after delivery, the\n\nefforts to give the child in adoption should begin at the earliest by the\n\nconcerned adoption agencies in active co-operation with the medical\n\nauthorities under whose care petitioner No. 1 may remain till her\n\ndelivery.

In the present appeals we are not concerned with\n         taking away of life before its birth. We are concerned with\n         destruction of foetus life. This is what is known as abortion\n         or miscarriage. To dispel any doubt as to whether the\n         foetus has a life, what has been stated by Taylor in his\n         Principle and Practice of Medical Jurisprudence may be\n         noted where the learned author has opined at p. 332 (13th\n         Edn.) that legally both abortion and miscarriage are\n         synonymous because the foetus being regarded as a\n         &quot;human life ... from the moment of fertilisation&quot;. It may,\n         however, be stated that sometimes the word &#x27;miscarriage&#x27; is\n         used for &quot;spontaneous abortion&quot; and &quot;abortion&quot; for\n         &quot;miscarriage produced by unlawful means&quot;.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_99\">         5.       This distinction is, however, not material for our\n         purpose because Section 312 of the Penal Code speaks\n         about causing of miscarriage and Section 314 punishes the\n         person who has intent to cause miscarriage of a woman and\n         while doing so causes the death of such woman. It is under\n         this section that the appellant has been found guilty by the\n         High court of Kerala after setting aside the acquittal order\n         of the learned Assistant Sessions Judge. For the offence\n         under Section 314, the appellant has been sentenced RI for\n         4 years and a fine of L 5,000.00. The High court had also\n         taken suo motu cognizance against the order of acquittal\n         and it is because of this that along with the criminal appeal\n         filed by the State which was registered as Criminal Appeal\n         No. 415 of 1989 the High court disposed of Cr.RC No. 44 of\n         1989, which is relatable to its own action. So, two aforesaid\n         appeals have been preferred by the appellant.

The charge of abortion is one which, even\n                 where it is not substantiated often leaves a stain on\n                 the honour of families. The power of bringing a false\n                 accusation of this description is therefore a\n                 formidable engine in the hands of unprincipled men.\n                 This part of the law will, unless great care be taken,\n                 produce few convictions but much misery and terror\n                 to respectable families, and a large harvest of profit\n                 to the vilest pests of society.

A plain reading of the above-quoted provision makes\n            it clear that Indian law allows for abortion only if the\n            specified conditions are met.. <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_85\">When the MTP Act</a> was first\n            enacted in 1971 it was largely modelled on the Abortion Act\n            of 1967 which had been passed in the United Kingdom. The\n            legislative intent was to provide a qualified &#x27;right to\n            abortion&#x27; and the termination of pregnancy has never been\n            recognised as a normal recourse for expecting mothers.\n            There is no doubt that a woman&#x27;s right to make\n            reproductive choices is also a dimension of &#x27;personal\n            liberty&#x27; as understood under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_86\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution\n\n\n\n\n                                   38 of 87\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_86\">                 ::: Downloaded on - 01-06-2016 00:11:11 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_87\">                                                            39</span>\nCWP-6733-2016\n\n\n         of India. It is important to recognise that reproductive\n         choices can be exercised to procreate as well as to abstain\n         from procreating. The crucial consideration is that a\n         woman&#x27;s right to privacy, dignity and bodily integrity\n         should be respected. This means that there should be no\n         restriction whatsoever on the exercise of reproductive\n         choices such as a woman&#x27;s right to refuse participation in\n         sexual activity or alternatively the insistence on use of\n         contraceptive methods. Furthermore, women are also free\n         to choose birth-control methods such as undergoing\n         sterilisation procedures. Taken to their logical conclusion,\n         reproductive rights include a woman&#x27;s entitlement to carry\n         a pregnancy to its full term, to give birth and to\n         subsequently raise children. However, in the case of\n         pregnant women there is also a &#x27;compelling state interest&#x27; in\n         protecting the life of the prospective child. Therefore, the\n         termination of a pregnancy is only permitted when the\n         conditions specified in the applicable statute have been\n         fulfilled. Hence, the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_87\">MTP Act, 1971</a> can\n         also be viewed as reasonable restrictions that have been\n         placed on the exercise of reproductive choices.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_103\">         <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"175763450\" id=\"span_88\">12.    A perusal of the above mentioned provision makes it\n         clear that ordinarily a pregnancy can be terminated only\n         when a medical practitioner is satisfied that a &#x27;continuance\n         of the pregnancy would involve a risk to the life of the\n         pregnant woman or of grave injury to her physical or\n         mental health&#x27; [as per <a href=\"/doc/357331/\" id=\"a_88\">Section 3(2)(i)</a>] or when &#x27;there is a\n         substantial risk that if the child were born, it would suffer\n         from such physical or mental abnormalities as to be\n         seriously handicapped&#x27; [as per <a href=\"/doc/357331/\" id=\"a_89\">Section 3(2)(ii)</a>]. While the\n         satisfaction of one medical practitioner is required for\n         terminating a pregnancy within twelve weeks of the\n\n\n\n                             39 of 87\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_89\">           ::: Downloaded on - 01-06-2016 00:11:11 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_90\">                                                                        40</span>\nCWP-6733-2016\n\n\n         gestation period, two medical practitioners must be\n         satisfied about either of these grounds in order to terminate\n         a pregnancy between twelve to twenty weeks of the\n         gestation period. The explanations to this provision have\n         also contemplated the termination of pregnancy when the\n         same is the result of a rape or a failure of birth-control\n         methods since both of these eventualities have been equated\n         with a &#x27;grave injury to the mental health&#x27; of a woman. In all\n         such circumstances, the consent of the pregnant woman is\n         an     essential        requirement        for   proceeding   with   the\n         termination        of     pregnancy.

An\n         ossification test has revealed that the physical age of the\n         victim is around 19-20 years.

If the pregnancy occurs as a result\n         of failure of any device or method used by the woman or her\n         husband for the purpose of limiting the number of children,\n         the anguish caused by such unwanted pregnancy is also\n         treated as constituting &#x27;grave injury to the mental health&#x27; of\n         the pregnant woman.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_121\">         6.

The perusal of <a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_111\">Section 3</a> also makes it clear that the\n         Act does not give a carte blanche to any person, even a\n         medical practitioner, to cause termination of pregnancy.\n         <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_112\">The Act</a> provides in express terms that the pregnancy can\n         be terminated upto twenty weeks and only by registered\n         medical practitioner. If the length of pregnancy exceeds\n         twelve weeks upto twenty weeks, it can be terminated only if\n         a Board of at least two registered medical practitioners is\n         of the opinion, in good faith, that the continuance of\n         pregnancy involves risk to the life of the pregnant woman\n         or cause grave injury to her physical and mental health.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_116\">         9.

The Statement of Objects and Reasons of the said Act\n         undoubtedly discloses that the legislation in the nature of\n         the said Act was enacted to regulate the matters in relation\n         to the termination of certain pregnancies. <a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_122\">Sections 3</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1891528/\" id=\"a_123\">5</a>\n         clearly speak of right to terminate pregnancy under the\n         specified    circumstances and      after taking   necessary\n         precautions and after obtaining medical opinion of the\n         medical experts who are required to give their opinion in\n         good faith in that regard. <a href=\"/doc/1891528/\" id=\"a_124\">Section 5</a> can be resorted to for\n         termination of pregnancy when the non-termination of\n         pregnancy would be dangerous to the life of pregnant\n         woman. It is not a mere desire to terminate the pregnancy\n         that will entitle either pregnant woman to go for\n         termination of pregnancy or for the doctors to assist the\n         pregnant woman to terminate the pregnancy by taking\n         resort to <a href=\"/doc/1891528/\" id=\"a_125\">Section 5</a> of the said Act.

As regards the physical or mental abnormalities of\n         serious nature to the child to be born which could be the\n         cause for termination of pregnancy, the legislature in its\n         wisdom has imposed certain period within which the\n         pregnancy can be terminated. Nothing is placed on record\n         on behalf of the petitioners even to remotely suggest that\n         the period so prescribed by the statute has been arbitrarily\n         prescribed or that there is no logic behind the period\n         prescribed by the legislature in that regard.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_123\">         22.

She must understand that termination at\n         this stage will put her own life in peril. I can only remind\n         her of what Helene Evans, a victim of rape, had to say in\n         these type of situations. I quote &quot;After the abortion, I\n         wanted to die. How could I live when I had just ended the\n         life of my child? The negative feelings resulting from the\n         rape were not eliminated by the abortion. Nothing was\n         solved; instead, the grief was now doubled.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_138\">         13.    I may also quote a short extract from an article\n         &quot;rape, incest and abortion; searching beyond the myths by\n         David C. Reardon Ph.D. &quot; Finally we must recognise that\n         children conceived though sexual assault also deserve to\n         have their voices heard. Rebecca Wasser-Kiessling, who\n         was conceived in a rape, is rightfully proud of her mother&#x27;s\n         courage and generosity and wisely reminds us of a\n         fundamental truth that transcends biological paternity. &quot;I\n         believe that God rewarded my birth mother for the suffering\n         she endured, and that I am a gift to her. The serial rapist is\n         not my creator, God is.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_139\">         Similarly, Julie Makimaa, who works diligently against the\n         perception that abortion is acceptable or even necessary in\n         cases of sexual assault, proclaims. &quot;it doesn&#x27;t matter how I\n         began. What matters is who I will become.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_140\">         14.    In the result, this application fails and is hereby\n         rejected.

She came, she used her\n            instrument, and, within an interval of time measured not by\n            minutes but by seconds, the victim of her malpractice was\n\n\n\n\n                                 60 of 87\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_138\">               ::: Downloaded on - 01-06-2016 00:11:11 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_139\">                                                                     61</span>\nCWP-6733-2016\n\n\n             dead on the floor. She was paid the rest of her fee and she\n             went away. That is the class of case that usually comes\n             before the court. The case here is very different. A man of\n             the highest skill, openly, in one of our great hospitals,\n             performs the operation. Whether it was legal or illegal you\n             will have to determine, but he performs the operation as an\n             act of charity, without fee or reward, and unquestionably\n             believing that he was doing the right thing, and that he\n             ought, in the performance of his duty as a member of a\n             profession devoted to the alleviation of human suffering, to\n             do it. That is the case that you have to try today.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_146\">25.19        In that case, a 14 years old girl was raped by five soldiers as\n\na result of which she became pregnant.

But because the foetus is &quot;an\n             autonomous human being&quot; under the protection of the\n             Constitution, the termination of pregnancy has a social\n             dimension which demands public regulation;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_152\">             (6) The Constitution also protects a woman&#x27;s right to free\n             development of her personality, which includes freedom to\n\n\n\n\n                                 62 of 87\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_142\">               ::: Downloaded on - 01-06-2016 00:11:11 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_143\">                                                                 63</span>\nCWP-6733-2016\n\n\n            decide against parenthood.

The Latin word\n\n&#x27;abortus&#x27; means miscarriage, premature, untimely birth.      In medical-\n\nterminology abortion means ending a pregnancy prematurely. An\n\nabortion is when the pregnancy is ended so that it does not result in the\n\nbirth of child. This is, in fact, called termination of pregnancy.

Many a\n\ntime, even doctors while examining the rape victims do not probe the\n\npossibility of pregnancy and many a time in spite of pregnancy, its\n\nnotice is not taken and medico-legal reports are prepared in a casual\n\nmanner, unmindful of the consequences specifically in rape cases. The\n\npractice stems from lack of awareness on the part of the doctors,\n\ninvestigating officers, lawyers and courts.

In    case, foetus is born alive during late termination of\n\npregnancy, physician, gynaecologist and obstetricians confront a serious\n\nproblem as performing late abortion is the gap between abstract theory\n\non foetal viability and realities of medical practice. Pregnancy due dates,\n\ndate of conception and foetal viability are still an uncertain area.\n\nViability is more difficult to assess.

The doctors in such circumstances\n\ncannot be penalized when they act in good faith and help a hapless\n\nvictim to abort the pregnancy caused due to rape. It appears that doctors\n\ndid not carry out termination of pregnancy for fear of prosecution under\n\nthe penal provisions referred to in the foregoing paras of this judgment.\n\nThis court is of the view that the fear of chilling effect of prosecution\n\nneeds to be removed from the mind of doctors. <a href=\"/doc/1836566/\" id=\"a_167\">Section 3</a> of MTP Act\n\nprovides a defence when the termination is done in accordance with the\n\nconditions set out in the <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_168\">MTP Act</a>. Further, a medical practitioner is\n\nprotected by <a href=\"/doc/171380/\" id=\"a_169\">Section 8</a> of MTP Act for &quot;any damage caused or likely to\n\nbe caused by anything&quot; for any act done in good faith under the <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_170\">MTP\n\nAct</a> . This court has to base its judgment completely upon the opinion of\n\nthe experts in the field and cannot issue directions on its own. The courts\n\nonly interpret the provisions of law and pass the order accordingly. To\n\nremove this fear of prosecution in the minds of the doctors, the\n\nauthorities concerned should issue procedural guidelines so that they\n\n\n\n\n                                 78 of 87\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_176\">               ::: Downloaded on - 01-06-2016 00:11:12 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_177\">                                                                 79</span>\nCWP-6733-2016\n\n\nmay act without fear in the interest of the patient.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_179\">38.          Way back in 1938 in the case of King vs. Broune (supra), it\n\nwas held that when a doctor on reasonable grounds and with adequate\n\nknowledge in the field comes to a conclusion of probable consequences\n\nof pregnancy that it will make the concerned victim /woman physically\n\nand mentally wrecked then the concerned doctor/doctors, if decide for\n\ntermination of pregnancy, are proceeding with purpose of preserving the\n\nlife of women. On the anvil of the settled position of law, the best\n\ninterests parameters and the social circumstances that may be faced by\n\nthe rape victim, the decisions of Court as well as of the doctors should be\n\nguided by the interest of the victim alone. Bearing this in mind, this\n\ncourt had given liberty to the doctors of the PGIMER to go ahead with\n\ntermination of pregnancy if it is not harmful to the victim and, rather, is\n\nrequired to preserve her mental and physical health. But the board\n\ndecided according to their wisdom not to go ahead with the same and\n\ncame to a conclusion that the termination of pregnancy should not be\n\ncarried out at this stage. In view of the opinion of Medical Board of\n\nPGIMER, this court cannot pass the order to terminate the pregnancy of\n\npetitioner No. 1.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_180\">39.          This Court is of the considered opinion, in the light of the\n\nfindings in the report dated 3rd of May 2016 to the effect that there is a\n\npossibility of harm to the patient due to social and emotional\n\nconsequences of continuation of pregnancy, then the inference can be\n\ndrawn that it will certainly cause grave injury to her physical and mental\n\n\n\n\n                                  79 of 87\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_178\">                ::: Downloaded on - 01-06-2016 00:11:12 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_179\">                                                                80</span>\nCWP-6733-2016\n\n\nhealth. Moreover, in the order dated 13.05.2016, this Court had referred\n\nto the judgements of the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court and the Hon&#x27;ble Gujarat\n\nHigh Court vide which the Courts have granted the permission for\n\ntermination of pregnancy beyond the prescribed period of 20 weeks\n\nunder the <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_171\">MTP Act</a>. The order also contains reference to <a href=\"/doc/1891528/\" id=\"a_172\">Section 5</a> of the\n\nMTP Act which gives power to the doctor to go ahead with the\n\ntermination of pregnancy if the same is necessitated on account of saving\n\nthe life of the woman. Therefore, pursuant to the order of this Court,\n\nthere was no risk of prosecution of the doctors if they would have gone\n\nahead with the termination of pregnancy of petitioner No.1. At that\n\njuncture, petitioner No.1 and her father - her natural guardian,were ready\n\nto give consent for termination of pregnancy.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_181\">40.         During the course of arguments, Ms. Tanu Bedi, amicus\n\ncuriae submitted that the petitioners come from area nearer to Delhi and\n\nshe may be referred to AIIMS for exploring further possibilities of\n\ntermination of pregnancy in view of the advancement in medical\n\nsciences.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_182\">41.         I would request Director of AIIMS to constitute another\n\nmedical board of equivalent or Larger number of doctors as of the\n\nPGIMER to explore the possibility of termination of pregnancy. The\n\nCourt requests the Director of AIIMS to do the needful as soon as\n\npossible and inform the Court about the actions taken. The petitioners\n\nwill be at liberty to appear before the medical board of AIIMS at the\n\nearliest possible. The medical experts of AIIMS are further requested to\n\n\n\n\n                                 80 of 87\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_180\">               ::: Downloaded on - 01-06-2016 00:11:12 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_181\">                                                                81</span>\nCWP-6733-2016\n\n\nprovide all the facilities including counselling etc. and explore the\n\npossibility for carrying out the termination of pregnancy if possible or\n\nother option in the best interest of the petitioner-victim.

In case the Board rules out the\n\ntermination at this stage and petitioner No. 1 is required to take the\n\npregnancy to its full term and the petitioners inform the Board about\n\ntheir unwillingness to keep the child, efforts should be made to make\n\narrangements for the adoption of child by involving the concerned\n\nofficials from Central Adoption Resource Authority (CARA).
