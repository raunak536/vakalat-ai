So far as this grievance of the assessee is concerned, the relevant material facts are\nlike this. The assessee before us an elderly lady, now in her late eighties. On 29th July 2006,\nshe had filed her income tax return, stating her residential address as 301, Embassy Erose,\nUlsoor Road, Bangalore and disclosing a returned income of Rs 1,70,800, in Ward 9(1),\nBangalore. This case was, by way of an order dated 20th December 2013 passed under <a href=\"/doc/330339/\" id=\"a_2\">section\n127</a> of the Income Tax Act, centralized with the present Assessing Officer. The income tax\nreturn filed by the assessee, in the meantime, was not subjected to any scrutiny at any stage.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">The assessment thus reached finality as such. On 31st October 2014, however, this\nassessment was reopened by issuance of notice under <a href=\"/doc/1888237/\" id=\"a_3\">section 148</a>. The reasons recorded, for\nso reopening the assessment, are as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">       Reason for re-opening the assessment\n\n       The case of THARANI RENU TIKAMDAS was centralized with the\n       undersigned vide order<a href=\"/doc/330339/\" id=\"a_4\"> u/s 127</a> of the IT Act- 1961 bearing No.\n       45/Centralization/CIT-IV/2013-14 dated 20.12.2013.

The records of this office show that this\n       amount has not been considered by her in her return of income and this income\n       therefore has escaped assessment. This evidence has come into the possession of\n       the undersigned; therefore, I have reason to believe that the income to the extent\n       of at least USD 3,97,38,122 has escaped assessment within the. meaning of para\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">       (d) to the Explanation 2 below <a href=\"/doc/1837761/\" id=\"a_5\">section 147</a> of the Act.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_6\">       In light of this, notice<a href=\"/doc/1888237/\" id=\"a_6\"> u/s 148</a> of the Income Tax Act, 1961 is issued.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">5.

The assessee also demanded the reasons for\nreopening the assessment, which were eventually furnished to the assessee. The assessee\nobjected to the reopening of assessment, and, inter alia, stated as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">       With reference to above and further to our letter dated!4th November 2014, we\n       would further like to submit that we are in receipt of your order sheet dated 30th\n       October 2014, wherein you have stated that, the Assessee has maintained a bank\n       with     HSBC       Bank      in    Geneva       bearing      account     number\n       BUP_SIFC_PER_ID_5090178411.

Moreover,\n       the total number of days which he has stayed in India during the previous 4\n       (four) financial years preceding the financial year ended 31st March 2006 is less\n       than 365 days and finally during the previous year relevant to the above\n       mentioned assessment the assessee has stayed in India for less than 60 -days,\n       hence all the conditions as specified in <a href=\"/doc/1757874/\" id=\"a_10\">section 6(1)</a> of the Income Tax Act 1961\n       has been complied with, wherein it concludes that the Assessee is a Non-\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">       Resident.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_9\">       As per the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/492579/\" id=\"a_11\">section 9(1)</a> of the Income Tax Act 1961, the Non-\n       Resident is chargeable to tax only on income which accrues or arises in India,\n       hence, the income which accrues or arises out of India, the same is not\n       chargeable to tax in the hands of the Assessee. In lieu of the above said facts &amp;\n       circumstances of the case, any income which accrues &amp; arises out of India, which\n       includes the income- deposited in HSBC Bank Geneva is not liable to be taxed in\n       the hands of the Assessee as per the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/492579/\" id=\"a_12\">section 9(1)</a> of the Income Tax\n       Apt 1961.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_10\">       Finally we would like to submit that the assessee has filed its Return of Income\n       for the above mentioned Assessment Year on 29th July 2006, which was enclosed\n       in our letter dated 14/11/2014 as the returned income was below the threshold\n       limit; hence no tax was liable to be paid.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_11\">       Thus, as the information received to you is incorrect (and) there is no reason\n       why the case should be re-opened, hence, we request you to kindly drop the re-\n       opening proceedings &amp; oblige.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_12\">6.      These objections, however, did not impress the Assessing Officer.

Shri Ved Jain, learned counsel for the assessee, begun by pointing out that the\nassessee is admittedly a non-resident assessee, inasmuch as the impugned assessment was\nframed on the assessee in her residential status as &quot;non-resident&quot;, and it was thus not at all\nrequired of her to disclose her foreign bank accounts, even if any. Learned counsel submits\nthat unlike in the United States, where global taxation of income of the assessee is on the\nbasis of citizenship, the basis of taxability of income outside India, in India, is on the basis of\nresidential status of the assessee. He takes pains to explain the fundamental principles of\ntaxation of global income in India. In response to a question from the bench, he accepts that\nall he wants to point out is that unless someone in resident in India, taxability of such a\nperson is confined to income accruing or arising in India, income deemed to accrue or arise in\nIndia, income received in India and income deemed to have been received in India. None of\nthese categories, he submits, covers the income, even if any, on account of an unexplained\ncredit outside India. He then points out that since 23rd March 2004, the assessee is regularly\nresiding in the United States of America, and that, post the financial year ended 31st March\n2006 onwards, she assessee is a non-resident assessee. In this backdrop, learned counsel‟s\nsubmission is that so far as a non-resident is concerned, it is not required of such an assessee\nto disclose any bank account outside India or report any income outside India unless it is\ncovered by the specific deeming fiction which is admittedly not the case at present. It is,\ntherefore, contended that any sums credited in the bank account in question cannot be taxed\nin the hands of the assessee, and, when it cannot be so taxed, the very foundation of the\nimpugned reassessment proceedings ceases to hold good in law. Leaned counsel submits that\nthe reason for formation of belief must have rational connection with or bearing on formation\nof belief. Rational connection was said to postulate that there must be direct nexus and live\nlink between material coming to the notice of the Assessing Officer and formation of belief\nthat there is some escapement of income which was taxable in the hands of the assessee.\nThat live link, according to the learned counsel, is missing in the facts of this case. Learned\ncounsel then submits that in any event the assessee did not have a bank account with HSBC,\nGeneva. What is being referred to in the &quot;base note&quot;, on the basis of which the assessment is\nbeing reopened, is not in respect of the assessee but admittedly GWU Investments Ltd, as\nhas been factually found, and, in any case, it is not even a bank statement but statement of\ninvestment. It is contended that the Assessing Officer was clearly in error in assuming that\nthe base note is in respect of a bank account. Learned counsel further submits that the\nassessee has categorically stated, on an affidavit,, that (a) the assessee never had any bank\naccount with HSBC Private Bank, Geneva; (b) that the assessee has never been signatory to\nany bank account with HSBC Private Bank, Geneva; (c) that the assessee is neither a director\nor a shareholder of GWU Investment Limited; and (d) that source of deposits made in\nGeneva has no source in India. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"90140239\" id=\"span_10\">It is reiterated time and again that the assessee is a non-\nresident, that the alleged income, even if any, cannot be taxed in India in the hands of a non-\nresident, that the assessee did not have any bank account with HSBC Geneva and that the\nassessee is not a shareholder or director in GWU Investment Limited which is admittedly\nsettlor of the Tharani Family Trust and which has given all the funds for the same. On the\nstrength of these submissions, it is contended that the reasons for reopening the assessment\nare not sustainable in law. Learned counsel for the assessee takes us through a large number\nof judicial precedents in support of his arguments. Our attention is invited to a coordinate\nbench decision in the case of <a href=\"/doc/90140239/\" id=\"a_15\">DCIT Vs Hemant Mansukhlal Pandya</a> [(2019) 174 ITD 101\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                                                             ITA No. 2333/Mum/2018</span>\n                                                                           Assessment year: 2006-07\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                                                                       Page 5 of 55</span>\n\n(Mum)] wherein it is inter alia held that where additions were made to income of assessee,\nwho was a non-resident since 25 years, since, no material was brought on record to show that\nfunds were diverted by assessee from India to source deposits found in foreign bank account,\nimpugned additions were unjustified. It is thus contended that the assessee also being a non-\nresident, such an income in foreign bank deposits, even if that be so, cannot be taxed in the\nhands of the assessee, and when that be so, the allegation in the reasons recorded for\nreopening the assessment, even if it is hypothetically assumed to be correct, cannot be legally\nsustainable basis for reopening the assessment.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"66808405\" id=\"span_13\">Learned counsel for the assessee then invites\nour attention to Hon‟ble Gujarat High Court, in the case of <a href=\"/doc/66808405/\" id=\"a_16\">Sunrise Education Trust Vs\nIncome Tax Officer</a> [(2018) 92 taxmann.com 74], in support of the proposition that\nassessment could not be reopened for mere verification in respect of alleged unexplained cash\ndeposits in a bank account.</span> A reference is then also made to Hon‟ble Gujarat High Court‟s\njudgement in the case of Krupesh Ghanshyambhai Thakkar Vs DCIT [(2017) 77\ntaxmann.com 293] when the assessment is sought to be reopened for deep verification of the\nclaims, such an reopening of assessment cannot be sustained in law. A reference was then\nmade to yet another judgment of the same Hon‟ble High Court, in the case of PCIT Vs\nManzil Dinesh Kumar Shah (406 ITR 326) wherein it has been held that a completed\nassessment cannot be reopened only for verification of information received by Assessing\nOfficer from VAT Department relating to purchase alleged to have been made by assessee\nfrom hawala dealers. It is also pointed out that SLP against this judgment has been dismissed\nby Hon‟ble Supreme Court in the judgment reported as PCIT Vs Manzil Dinesh Kumar\nShah [2019] 101 taxmann.com 259 (SC). <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"49143120\" id=\"span_14\">Learned counsel then invites our attention to the\njudgment of Hon‟ble Rajasthan High Court, in the case of <a href=\"/doc/49143120/\" id=\"a_17\">Mukesh Modi Vs DCIT</a> [(2014)\n366 ITR 418 (Raj)], wherein it is said to have been held that reassessment proceedings only\nto for his AO‟s own verification and to clear his doubts cannot be sustained in law.</span> Learned\ncounsel then refers to the decision of a coordinate bench of this Tribunal, in the case of Sonal\nArpit Doshi Vs ITO (ITA No. 366/Ahd/16; order dated 21st October 2015), wherein it is\nheld that the reassessment proceedings cannot be initiated merely for verification of certain\ntransactions. Learned counsel then refers to the judgment of Hon‟ble jurisdictional High\nCourt, in the case of Cyrus Kersi Vandervala Vs ITO (WP No. 2551 of 2016; judgment\ndated 11 January 2017), wherein it is said to have been held that in the case of a non-\nresident, the reassessment proceedings cannot be started even for non filing of return merely\non the basis of certain assumptions about business connection in India which could lead to\nincome taxable in India. It is thus submitted that on these facts, and in the light of the legal\nposition so well settled, the reassessment proceedings cannot be sustained in law. We are\nurged to hold these reassessment proceedings as bad in law, and quash the same. Shri\nAvneesh Tiwari, learned Departmental Representative, submits that it is an open and shut\ncase for reopening of assessment. It is stated that the claim of the assessee being non-resident\nwas made only after the reopening of assessment was initiated. In any case, looking to the\nhuge funds found at the disposal of the assessee abroad, such amounts could not have been\nearned by the assessee after becoming non-resident, i.e. 23rd March 2004. It is pointed out\nthat the income tax return is filed showing a meagre income of Rs 1,70, 800 and a person of\nsuch modest means is, on the basis of credible information available from abroad, is found to\nbe at the disposal of US $ 3,97,38,122. Obviously, this huge income could not have been\nearned by the assessee in the US, where she was resident, in one year. Learned Departmental\nRepresentative then submits that as per the base note, received by the investigation wing, the\nassessee was holding an account in HSBC Private Bank Geneva, with BUP Code as\n5090178411, and this account was created on 28th July 2004, and the assessee was beneficial\nowner of the said amount. He submits that the unaccounted monies are not deposited in the\nSwiss Banks in own names, but through a complex web of layering, nominee directors and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                                                                               ITA No. 2333/Mum/2018</span>\n                                                                             Assessment year: 2006-07\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                                                                                         Page 6 of 55</span>\n\ntrusts or companies, and, therefore, as long as an assessee is a beneficiary of the amounts held\nin trust by Banks in tax havens, that is a good reason to believe that, unless such amounts are\nfound to be disclosed in assessee accounts or tax returns- which admittedly is the case here,\nthese amounts represent income escaping assessment. Learned Departmental Representative\nsubmits that so far as reopening of assessment is concerned, all that is to be seen is whether\nprima facie there is a reason to believe that some income has escaped assessment, and when\none sees a person, with returned income of Rs 1,70,800, being beneficial owner of Rs\n196,46,79,146 in a Swiss Bank, there is clearly good reason to believe that income has\nescaped assessment in the hands of the assessee. Learned Departmental Representative\nsubmits that there cannot be any reason for anyone, leave aside an entity of unknown people\nin a tax haven, leaving such a sum for her as a beneficiary. It is contended that based on the\nmaterial on record, the Assessing Officer indeed had reasons to believe that the income has\nescaped assessment. Learned Departmental Representative then takes up these judgments\nand makes efforts to show how the facts of these cases are materially different from the facts\nof the case before us. He submits that unless the facts of these judicial precedents are in pari\nmateria with the facts of the case before us, the conclusions arrived at in these cases cannot\nbe straightaway applied to the present case. He submits that here is a case in which cogent\nand specific information has come to be in possession of the Assessing Officer, about the\nassessee being linked with Swiss Bank account holding huge balance, and the material on\nrecord does not indicate means of the assessee to justify such huge investments, and it is for\nthis reason that the assessment has been reopened. The bank account remains undisclosed to\nthe income tax authorities, and the amounts so placed therein have not been considered in the\nreturn of income filed by the assessee. It is for these reasons that learned Departmental\nRepresentative contends that the reopening of assessment is perfectly justified in law and on\nthe facts of this case. Learned Departmental Representative also vehemently relies upon the\norders of the authorities below, and justifies the same. In a brief rejoinder, learned counsel for\nthe assessee reiterates his submissions, and submits that his basic points remains unanswered\nin the sense that the Assessing Officer himself has framed the assessment in the status of the\nassessee as &quot;non-resident&quot; and when there is no requirement requiring a &quot;non-resident&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">assessee to disclose his bank account or income abroad, how can the assessment be reopened\non the ground that the assessee failed to disclose the bank account or the assessee did not\nconsider the said foreign bank account in the income tax return. He submits that when an\nassessee is a &quot;non-resident&quot; it cannot be for the Assessing Officer to examine income of such\nan assessee outside India or bank accounts held by such an assessee outside. He submits that\nthe Assessing Officer was clearly travelling much beyond the call of, or the scope of, his\nduty in going into that aspect of the matter. The very foundation of the reassessment\nproceedings, according to the learned counsel, is vitiated in law, and, for this short reason\nalone, he must succeed. Once again a reference is made to the judicial precedents, which\naccording to the learned counsel, have not been specifically dealt with beyond too general a\nline of arguments. It is again pointed out that the assessee did not have any bank account in\nHSBC Private Bank, Geneva, and that this account was operated by some GWU Investments\nLtd which is neither owned by the assessee nor the assessee is a shareholder in the said\ncompany. The existence of this account, therefore, cannot be a good ground for reopening of\nthe assessment of the assessee before us. He submits that it is not even a bank statement, but a\nstatement of investment, which is referred to in the base note. The reasons for reopening the\nassessment are thus factually incorrect too. Whichever way we look at it, it is submitted, the\ninitiation of reassessment proceedings are unsustainable in law. We are thus once again urged\nto quash the reassessment proceedings.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                                                                               ITA No. 2333/Mum/2018</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">                                                                             Assessment year: 2006-07\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                                                                                         Page 7 of 55</span>\n\n\n\nOur analysis:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">8.      As we have given our careful consideration to the rival contentions and the material\non record in the light of applicable legal position, we have also taken of the factual matrix of\nthis case. Here is an assessee who files her return of income, disclosing a meagre income of\nRs 1,70,800, giving a Bangalore address and files the income tax return a ward which was\nmeant for resident assessees. Going by the facts placed by the assessee on record, which are\nalso set out in the paper-book, the Bangalore property was sold in the year ended March\n2003, but yet income tax return continued to be filed at that address. It is not clear as to what\nwas the basis of filing the income tax return at Bangalore but then let‟s leave it at that for the\ntime being. The income tax return filed by the assessee, a copy of which is placed before us at\npage 62 of assessee‟s paper-book, does not at all tick the status as &quot;non-resident&quot;, but there is\na clearly visible mark in the status as &quot;resident&quot;. On these facts, the Assessing Officer, to\nwhom this case was transferred as a result of order under <a href=\"/doc/330339/\" id=\"a_18\">section 127</a>, notices that the\nassessee has a bank account, as per information in his possession, with HSBC Private Bank\nGeneva, bearing a number BUP_SIFIC_PER_ID- 5090178411 with a peak credit, during\nthe relevant period, of a sum of more than US $3.97 crores equivalent to around Rs 200\ncrores at that point of time. The base note, a copy of which is placed at pages 3 to 12 of\nassessee‟s paper-book, clearly shows &quot;Tharani Renu Tikamdas&quot; as &quot;beneficial owner/\nbeneficiary&quot; of this account, that her date and place of birth are10th May 1934 and\nHyderabad (Pakistan) respectively, and that the account was opened on 28th July 2004. This\nnote also shows, under the heading &quot;personnes liees aux profile client&quot; (which as simple\ngoogle translation would show as meaning &quot;people linked to customer profile&quot;), GWU\nInvestments Limited as with &quot;power of administration&quot;. The overall &quot;patrimoine max\nconstaté sur la period&quot; (which as simple google translation would show as meaning &quot;max\nwealth observed during the period&quot;) on 02/2007 as US $ 5,62,47,590, but then that aspect of\nthe matter is not relevant for this year. Suffice to note that the residential status of the\nassessee as shown in the income tax return was &quot;resident&quot;, and definitely not &quot;non-resident&quot;,\nthat the peak credit at her disposal in this Swiss Bank account was over 11,500 times of her\nannual income, and that the assessee had admittedly not taken into account this account in\nher return of income. The claim of the assessee regarding her having a non-resident status in\nthe relevant previous year came much after the reasons recorded, and, quite contrary to this\nclaim, as our perusal of records shows, the assessee herself had claimed the residential status\nas &quot;resident&quot; in the income tax return. The Assessing Officer has to record his satisfaction\nabout income escaping assessment as on the basis of material in his possession and on record\nas on the time of recording the reasons for reopening the assessment. A subsequent claim,\nwhich was not on record at the time of the reasons being recorded, cannot affect the\ncorrectness of these reasons, even though once this claim is made in the assessment\nproceedings, it will have to be examined on merits and it will have to be adjudicated as such\nin the outcome of the assessment proceedings. Nothing, therefore, turns on the facts not on\nrecord before the Assessing Officer as on the stage of recording the reasons of reopening the\nassessment. In any case, when the assessee herself is making an incorrect claim in the income\ntax return, she cannot claim that because the Assessing Officer believed the claim so made,\nand took initial steps on that basis, the Assessing Officer was in error in taking that path. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"123463989\" id=\"span_19\">Of\ncourse, all this does not affect the question of determination of her residential status on\nmerits, but that is not the question as on now. The question is whether the Assessing Officer\nhad reasons to believe income escaping the assessment, or not. It is also important to bear in\nmind the fact that at the stage of issuance of notice, the Assessing Officer is to only form a\nprima facie view. Explaining this principle, Hon‟ble jurisdictional High Court, in the case of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                                                                             ITA No. 2333/Mum/2018</span>\n                                                                           Assessment year: 2006-07\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">                                                                                       Page 8 of 55</span>\n\n<a href=\"/doc/123463989/\" id=\"a_19\">Multi Commodity Exchange of India Ltd Vs DCIT</a> [(2018) 91 taxmann.com 265 (Bom )]\n[SLP dismissed as reported in (2019) 101 taxmann.com 13 (SC)], has observed that &quot;We find\nthat the power of the Assessing Officer to reopen an assessment under <a href=\"/doc/1837761/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 147</a>/<a href=\"/doc/1888237/\" id=\"a_21\">148</a>\nof the Act on the basis of reasonable belief is not fettled or circumscribed, to be formed\nonly on material found during a tax audit or with material found during examining a\ncase of tax evasion. In fact the basis of fresh tangible material is unqualified i.e. the\nsource of the material could be from any place, however, the only pre-condition is that\non the basis of the material so found/obtained by the Assessing Officer, he himself must\nform a reasonable belief that income chargeable to tax has escaped assessment before\nissuing a notice for reopening.</span> In fact the Apex Court has observed in Asstt. CIT v.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\">Rajesh Jhaveri Stock Brokers (P.) Ltd. [2007] 161 Taxman 316/291 ITR 500 has\nobserved that if the Assessing Officer for whatever reasons (material) has reason to\nbelieve that income chargeable to tax has escaped assessment then jurisdiction is\nconferred upon the Assessing Officer to reopen the assessment&quot;. As held by Hon‟ble\njurisdictional High Court, in the case of Multiscreen Media Pvt Ltd Vs CIT [(2010) 324\nITR 54 (Bom)], &quot;the expression &quot;reason to believe&quot; must obviously be that of a prudent\nperson and it is on the basis of the reasons recorded by the Assessing Officer that the\nquestion as to whether there was a reason to believe that income has escaped\nassessment, has to be determined. At the same time, the sufficiency of the reasons for\nreopening an assessment does not fall for determination, at the stage of a reopening of\nassessment&quot;. In the light of this legal position, in our considered view, based on the facts\nabove i.e. credible information about existence of her account with HSBC Private Bank\nGeneva with a peak credit of around Rs 200 crores in the relevant financial year- which is far\ndisproportionate to her reported annual income and which is not taken into account in her\nreturn of income, the Assessing Officer was perfectly justified in holding the view that the\nincome has escaped assessment.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_16\">9.      As regards the judicial precedents cited at the bar, all these cases deal with the\nsituation in which the assessee was stated to be non-resident or when the reassessment was\ndone only for verification of some information. That‟s not the case here. The income tax\nreturn filed by the assessee, which was available at the time of recording the reasons for\nreopening the assessment, did not show the status of non-resident. The recording of reasons\ncannot thus be faulted. Whatever claim is made subsequently is required to be dealt with in\nthe subsequent proceeding but it will not vitiate the validity of reasons recorded for reopening\nthe assessment. The facts of the decision cited on the line of reasoning that cases of non-\nresidents cannot be reopened on the basis of existence of foreign bank account, in any event,\nare not in pari materia inasmuch as in none of these cases the assessee had filed the income\ntax return in the status of resident. As regards the decisions that reopening cannot be done for\nmere verifications, the present case is not a case which some general and vague information\nis received about the assessee, which may or may not lead to an income escaping assessment\nin the hands of the assessee, and which is thus required to be examined on merits, but of a\nvery specific cogent information regarding a bank account, with complete details that is good\nenough for holding at least the prima facie view that income has escaped in the assessment in\nthe hands of the assessee. The peak balance in the account, which has subsequently come to\nthe knowledge of the Assessing Officer and on the basis of which reopening is done, is tens\nof thousand times more than annual income of the assessee.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_17\">10.    We have also noted that the assessee had shifted to the United States only just seven\ndays before the beginning of the relevant previous year, and it will be too unrealistic an\nassumption that within these seven days plus the relevant financial year what the assessee\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">                                                                                ITA No. 2333/Mum/2018</span>\n                                                                              Assessment year: 2006-07\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">                                                                                          Page 9 of 55</span>\n\ncould have earned this huge amount of around Rs 200 crores, which, at the rate at which she\ndid earn in India in the last year, would have taken her more than 11,500 years to earn. Even\nif one goes by the basis, though the material on record at the time of recording reasons did\nnot at all indicate so, that the assessee was a non-resident in this assessment year, which is,\ngoing by the specific submissions of the assessee, was admittedly first year of her &quot;non-\nresident&quot; status, it was wholly unrealistic to assume that the money at her disposal in the\nSwiss Bank account reflected income earned outside India in such a short period of one year.\nViewed thus, whether the assessee was a resident in India in this year or not, the Assessing\nOfficer would have been perfectly justified in holding the &quot;prima facie&quot; view that, de-hors\nher new acquired non resident status, the peak amount of US $ 3,97,38,122 &quot;not being\nconsidered in her income tax return&quot; shows that &quot;income has escaped assessment&quot; in the\nhands of the assessee. Be that as it may, since the assessee did not disclose the status of &quot;non-\nresident&quot; in the income tax return filed by the assessee anyway, and the reasons recorded for\nreopening the assessment can only be on the basis of material on record or the information\ncoming in the possession of the Assessing Officer- which indicated that the assessee was a\n&quot;resident&quot; in the relevant previous year, this aspect of the matter is wholly the sole and\ndecisive factor leading to our conclusion about correctness of the reasons recorded for\nreopening the assessment.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_18\">Our conclusions on validity of reassessment proceedings:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_19\">11.    In the light of the detailed reasons analyzed in the foregoing discussions, as also\nbearing in mind entirety of the case, in our considered view, the correctness of reopening of\nassessment, on the facts of this case and in the light of settled legal position, cannot be faulted\nwith. We confirm the action of the authorities below on this point and decline to interfere in\nthe matter.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_20\">Challenge to addition of Rs 196.46 crores to the returned income\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_21\">12.    We now turn to the question as to whether or not the learned CIT(A) was justified in\nupholding the addition in the hands of the assessee for Rs 196,46,79,146, being an amount\nequivalent to US $ 3,97,38,122 at the relevant point of time, held by HSBC Private Bank,\nGeneva, Switzerland, in the name of Tharani Family Trust, of which the assessee was a\nbeneficiary.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_22\">The relevant material facts:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_23\">13.     To adjudicate on this question, facts of the case, in detail, need to be taken note of.\nThe assessee before us is an individual. The assessee had filed her income tax return, on 29th\nJuly 2006, disclosing an income of Rs 1,70,800 for the relevant previous year, but\nsubsequently the investigation wing of the income tax department, as noted in the earlier part\nof this order, received information that the assessee is having a bank account with HSBC\nPrivate Bank (Suisse) SA Geneva. Based on this information, a copy of which is placed\nbefore us at pages 3 to 12 of the assessee‟s paper-book, this case was reopened for fresh\nassessment on 30th October 2014. When the assessee was confronted with the information so\nreceived by the Assessing Officer, the assessee‟s representative, vide letter dated 9th January\n2015 (wrongly stated to be letter dated 9th January 2014 in the paper-book; copy placed at\npages 37 onwards in the assessee‟s paper-book), wrote to the Assessing Officer that\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                                                                            ITA No. 2333/Mum/2018</span>\n                                                                          Assessment year: 2006-07\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">                                                                                     Page 10 of 55</span>\n\n&quot;enclosed please find herewith a letter dated 14th November 2015 and 5th September\n2011, which confirms that Mrs Renu Tharani has neither been an account holder of\nHSBC nor a beneficial owner of any assets deposited in account with HSBC Private\nBank (Suisse) SA, Switzerland, during the last 10 years&quot;. It was further stated that HSBC\nPrivate Bank (Suisse) SA has also &quot;confirmed that GWU Investments Ltd was holder of\nthe account number 1414771, and, according to their records, GWU Investments\nLimited used to be an underlying company of Tharani Family Trust for which Mrs\nRenu Tharani was a discretionary beneficiary&quot; and that &quot;(t)he Tharani Family Trust\nwas terminated and none of the assets deposited with them were distributed to Mrs\nRenu Tharani&quot;. It was further stated that &quot;with this letter, as an evidence, it is now very\nclear that Mrs Renu Tharani does not hold any account with HSBC Private Bank\n(Suisse) SA, either in Geneva or any other place in Switzerland, hence the base note\nissued by you is inaccurate as she does not have any account with HSBC Bank Geneva\nbearing number BUP_SIFIC_PER_ID_5090178411 or any other number&quot;.

In\na subsequent communication dated 16th February 2015- a copy of which is placed before us at\npaper-book pages 41 onwards, the Assessing Officer was further, inter alia, informed as\nfollows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">       In the letter dated 5th January (2015) received from HSBC Private Bank (Suisse)\n       SA in Zurich also confirms the fact that account number 1414771 which is\n       started in your base note belongs to GWU Investments Ltd, having its address at\n       Avalon Management Limited, Landmark Square, 1st floor, Earth Close 64, West\n       Bet Beach South, Grand Cayman, (PO Box No 715, KY1-1107), and it does not\n       belong to Mrs Renu Tikamdas Tharani.

It was, vide letter dated 25th February 2015, contended that the assessee has duly\ndischarged the onus &quot;by getting a clarification from the HSBC Private Bank (Suisse) SA\nthat GWU Investments Ltd is an underlying company of Tharani Family Trust and she\nis only a discretionary beneficiary&quot;. A reference was then made to Hon‟ble Supreme\nCourt‟s judgment in the case of <a href=\"/doc/31368495/\" id=\"a_23\">Commissioner of Wealth Tax, Rajkot v. Estate of HMM\nVikramsinhji of Gonda</a> (2014) 45 taxmann.com 552 (SC) in support of the proposition that\nin the case of beneficiary of a discretionary trust, income can only be taxed when the income\nis actually received, but then in the present case, the assessee has not received any money in\nthe capacity of beneficiary. It was submitted that &quot;in the light of the above said facts, there is\nno reason as to why you should insist in asking the assessee to provide you the details of the\naccount standing in the name of GWU Investments Ltd, as she is in no position to provide\nyou the details for the reasons mentioned in the above para&quot;.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_30\">16.    None of these submissions, however, impressed the Assessing Officer. He rejected the\nsubmissions made by the assessee, and proceeded to make an addition of Rs Rs\n196,46,79,146, being an amount equivalent to US $ 3,97,38,122 at the relevant point of time,\nby observing as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">       12.     The submission of the assessee are considered.

It is\n               surprising that she does not know about the settler of the Trust as well as\n               the sources of deposits made in the HSBC account. No bank account\n               statement has been provided nor the source of deposits made in the\n               account explained by the assessee even after specific queries were raised\n               on this.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_33\">               (b) It is also surprising that as a beneficiary she did not receive any assets\n               when the Tharani Family Trust was terminated and if that be so, then\n               where all the money went after termination of the Tharani Family Trust\n               is open to question and the same remains unexplained.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_34\">               (c) The assessee has an address in India.

Even though the\n       returned income were not substantial, these facts show that she is having\n       her interests in India.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_35\">       (d) Having interests and assets in India and not producing the details of\n       an account that she ought to know creates a circumstance in which she is\n       holding back the information that is prejudicial to her interests.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_36\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"31368495\" id=\"span_33\">13.    The assessee relied on the decision of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in the\ncase of <a href=\"/doc/31368495/\" id=\"a_24\">Commissioner of Wealth Tax Rajkot Vs. Estate of Late HMM\nVikramsinhji of Gondal (Civil Appeal</a> 2312 of 2007). However it must be\nunderstood that the main question before the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court <a href=\"/doc/31368495/\" id=\"a_25\">in that\ncase</a> was whether the trusts settled in the UK were in the nature of specific trusts\nor discretionary trusts in order to determine whether or not income of the Trust\nshould be included in the return of income of the settler of the Trust being the\nex-ruler of Gondal Shri Vikramsinghji and on his death to his son. Shri.\nJyotendrasinhiji who was the appellant in this case. The assessee during the\nassessment proceedings has not brought on record the various details of the\nTharani Family Trust in order to show that this decision of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme\nCourt is applicable to her case. In fact, the assessee has not brought on record\nany material evidence about the Tharani family trust apart from the letter of\nHSBC that she is a discretionary beneficiary; this fact is already mentioned in\nthe base note itself.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_37\">         On the other hand, it must be seen that underlying company of the\nTharanı family trust, i.e. GWU Investments Ltd is a company having address in\nthe Cayman islands which is a tax haven and the account is maintained in HSBC,\nGeneva which is known for its banking secrecy laws and in recent times has\nfaced investigation from various authorities in its role in facilitating tax evasion\nof its clients. Considering the facts of this case, the decision of the Hon‟ble ITAT,\nMumbai in the case of Mohan Manoj Dhupelia and other in ITA no. 3544/Mum/\n2011 etc, is directly applicable to this case. In this case, the assessee is a\nbeneficiary of Ambrunova Trust having an account in Liechtenstein Bank which\nis another tax jurisdiction known for its secrecy law and modest tax regime. In\nfact, in the order of the ITAT, it has been concluded that Liechtenstein\njurisdiction qualifies as an off shore financial centre due to a very modest tax\nregime, high standard of secrecy laws and further foreign investors had the\nopportunity to establish companies or trust in the principality of Liechtenstein to\nthe enjoy the advantages of off-shore financial centre\n       The ground of appeal before the Hon&#x27;ble ITAT in this case was as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">           &quot;The ld. Commissioner of Income tax (Appeals), erred in confirming\n       the order of the Assessing Officer making an addition of Rs.2,34,64,398/-\n       on account of alleged undisclosed income, without appreciating the fact\n       that the alleged trust was discretionary trust as neither the amount was\n       accrued nor credited to the Appellant&#x27;s name, hence addition cannot be\n       made in the hands of the Appellant&quot;.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">                                                                  ITA No. 2333/Mum/2018</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_38\">                                                                Assessment year: 2006-07\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">                                                                           Page 14 of 55</span>\n\n       The Hon&#x27;ble Mumbai ITAT dismissed this ground of appeal raised by the\nassesse and held that discretionary trusts are created for the benefit of particular\npersons and those persons need not necessarily control the affairs of the trust.\nThe bank account of the trust represents unaccounted money of the beneficiaries\neven though no benefit were transferred to them.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_39\">13.1 Considering the facts of the case and the decision of the Hon‟ble Mumbai\nITAT as cited above it can be concluded that the bank account of the trust\nrepresents unaccounted money of the assesse. Considering the fact that the\nassessee is an Indian having interests and assets in India that no details were\ngiven to show the source of money deposited in the HSBC account leads to the\ncircumstances that this unaccounted money is sourced from India. In absence of\nanything contrary, the only logical conclusion that can be inferred is that that the\namounts deposited are unaccounted deposits sourced from India and therefore\ntaxable in India. This presumption is as per the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_26\">section 114</a> of The\nIndian Evidence Act, 1872 which reads as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">&quot;<a href=\"/doc/1424696/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 114</a>.

Thus, as per the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 114</a> of The\nIndian Evidence Act, 1872 also, it need to be held at this stage that the\ninformation/details not furnished were unfavorable to the assesse and that the\nsource of the money deposited in the HSBC account is undisclosed and sourced\nfrom India. Nova Promoters and Finlease (P) Ltd. 342 ITR 169 (Del),\nhighlighting the legal effect of <a href=\"/doc/862769/\" id=\"a_31\">section 68</a> of the Act, the Division Bench has\nobserved in para 32 that &quot; The tribunal also erred in law in holding Assessing\nOfficer ought to have proved that the monies emanated from the coffers of the\nassesse company and came back as share capital. <a href=\"/doc/862769/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 68</a> permits the\nAssessing Officer to add the credit appearing in the books of account of the\nassesse if the latter offers and explanation regarding the nature and source of the\ncreditor the explanation offered is not satisfactory.

GWU Investments Ltd having address in Cayman Islands has\n                     investment managed as Shri Haresh Tharani, son of the appellant.\n               The Assessing Officer has rebutted the submission of the assessee before\n       him. Virtually the same submission on the aspect is reiterated before me. As\n       Assessing Officer has effectively rebutted the same, backed by judicial precedent, I\n       hold that the reasons recorded in rejecting various submissions in the assessment\n       order. The submission before me highlights certain drawbacks in the finding of the\n       Assessing Officer is in order. It can be seen that arguments like &quot;The Assessing\n       Officer has also not brought any material to show and demonstrate that any money\n       has been deposited by the assessee&quot; are placed when the onus is on assessee that\n       the same is explained lies with her, as judicially accepted. Another claim is full co-\n       operation which is unacceptable since consent waiver form was not furnished when\n       the Assessing Officer sought for same at the time he issued the first posting notice.\n       Further, he cites that in the case relied upon by Assessing Officer, the assessee\n       concerned is a resident where as the appellant is non-resident. This is not the issue\n       here and the issue is decided on the totality of various circumstances and facts,\n       discussed in this order The holding pattern of entities concerned and the contents\n       of the base note cement the issue. The fact that the appellant is sole beneficiary\n       implies that there is never a case of distribution and all income concerning the asset\n       only belongs to her i.e. will accrue or arise only to her from the moment beneficial\n       rights came to the appellant.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_40\">       22.

A\ndocument with statutory backing again from foreign source with counters the above\nletters are discussed in next paragraph.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_47\">23.     In course of hearing before me additional information received from foreign\njurisdiction was provided to assessee.

Cayman Islands British West Indies (the original\ntrustee). In schedule II it is clearly seen that the settler is also having Indian\nAddress pointing to its origin i.e. Mumbai, India. This is an additional dimension.\nThe document in page 21 where schedule II is figuring mentions „Renu‟ as the\nbeneficiary mentioned as settler‟s daughter and being so settler is father of „Renu‟.\nThis brings to light probable expansion of GWU which when the entire document is\nread through together leads again to GWU Investments Limited. In the said\ndocument bunch, there is a letter addressed to HSBC Trust Services (Suissee) AG\nby HSBC International Trustee Limited as Trustee of the Tharani Family\nSettlement which reads as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_41\">We, HSBC International Trustee Limited confirm that we hold issued shares of\nGWU Investments Limited as Trustee of the Tharani Family Settlement\nVital facts emerging from the document bunch obtained officially from Sovereign\nGovernment shows address of both appeal and that of GWU is same viz 1 Prabhat\nBuilding, 28 B Road, Chruchgate, Mumbai 400020 and that HSBC International\nTrustee Limited has confirmed that they hold issued shares of GWU Investments\nLimited as Trustee of the Tharani Settlement. The trust has only one beneficiary viz\nRenu Tharani. Shares or a company which provided Indian Address to a Foreign\nBank is held on her behalf. These facts reinforce the case against her.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_48\">24.     Settlor means &quot;a person who makes a settlement, especially of property on\nestablishing a trust&quot;. This adds additional dimension to case. Settlor is Indian,\nholder of asset is India. Address given to asset based abroad by the beneficiary (sole\nbeneficiary) is in India and not proven to be reported in the country of residence.\nLastly and most important consent waiver&quot; was never filed before Assessing Officer\nshowing that the appellant was disinclined to department collecting authentic\ninformation from HSBC Geneva. The legally settled principle of discharging the\nonus that the assessee is out of explained source fails in her case.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_49\">25.      In this connection, during course of hearing specific attention was brought\nto contents of decision in Soignee. R Kotharí Vs DCIT, Central Circle-8(3),\nMumbai &amp;Ors in Writ Petition (L) No. 3177 of 2015 of Mumbai High Court dated\n05.04.2016. This considers many issues involved starting from issue of notice under\n<a href=\"/doc/1888237/\" id=\"a_36\">section 148</a> on Non- Resident. Assessment of information in similar case received\nfrom French authorities on bank account in HSBC, Geneva etc. It also deals with\nimpact of refusal to sign consent waiver. These goes against the assessee. An\nextract from the order is reproduced below:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_42\">       In the normal course of human conduct if a person has nothing to hide and\n       serious allegations/questions are being raised about the funds a person\n       would make available the documents which would put to rest all questions\n       which seem to arise in the mind of the Authorities. The conduct on the part\n       of the Petitioner and her uncle in not being forthcoming, to our mind leads\n       us to the conclusion that this is not a fit case where we should exercise our\n       extra ordinary writ jurisdiction and/or interfere with the orders passed by the\n       authorities under the Act. If a person has nothing to hide we believe the\n       person would have cooperated in obtaining the Bank Statements.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">                                                                   ITA No. 2333/Mum/2018</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_43\">                                                                 Assessment year: 2006-07\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">                                                                            Page 19 of 55</span>\n\nThe same is seen in this case. It is more denials and shifting of responsibility to\nAssessing Officer in place of hard facts were the ones that the appellant was to\nproduce before him.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_44\">26.     The appellant filed detailed submission, counter comments to remand report\nas well as on new information received by Assessing Officer. Most of the objections\nhave already been addressed and some needs discussion. They are (along with\ncomments on the same):\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_45\">       a.      The AO has not rebutted the objections in his remand report\n       regarding validity of reassessment proceedings: The decision maker in this\n       case is CIT(A). He has the power to decide a ground of appeal irrespective of\n       whether a remand report is received or not and rebutted or not. The matter\n       has been addressed when ground was adjudicated earlier in this order.\n       b.     The trust deed states that assessee is not settler of trust or\n       shareholder or director of GWU Investment Ltd; This does not affect the\n       issue. We are concerned with the Beneficial Ownership of the trust asset\n       which is sole in the a beneficiary of the assets/income under consideration\n       of Assessing Officer without the authorization of the appellant.\n       c.     Indian address given is passport address and should not be viewed\n       adversely. On this matter, this in not to be viewed in isolation but\n       considering totality of circumstances, consideration of vital information\n       brought before IT authorities and lack of information from side of\n       appellant, These were the determining factors in the decision in this order\n       d.     There was interim remand report. The appellant seeks the same: As\n       this is not considered in my decision making since it contained no\n       meaningful comments and is basically for seeking extension of time, the\n       same is not provided. No prejudice is caused to assessee.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_46\">       e.     Certain information from foreign tax jurisdiction is still due: As\n       these have not been received there is no case of drawing any inference.\n       Some information is to come from foreign jurisdiction like Cayman Islands,\n       and receipt is uncertain and appellate proceedings cannot be held in\n       abeyance indefinitely under uncertain circumstances.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_47\">       f.      Reasons for not signing consent waiver: In para 12.9 some reasons\n       are stated. It is that the account does not pertain to the appellant and hence\n       not signed. If there is nothing to hide, the same could be provided and the\n       Assessing Officer or the foreign tax agency, in accordance with provisions\n       of tax treaty will decide whether to provide the information or not. The\n       reasons adduced is unconvincing and unacceptable.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_48\">27.    This is a case were the decision was to be made by Assessing Officer and the\nundersigned where information flow for taking decision appellant. It is more not\ninadequate form side of on producing case decisions, denials and providing\nalternate Correct decision comes when correct input is presented. The following\nquestions were recurring in course of hearing and stood unanswered.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">                                                                           ITA No. 2333/Mum/2018</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_50\">                                                                         Assessment year: 2006-07\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_50\">                                                                                    Page 20 of 55</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_51\">              (a)    if Renu Tharani denies the ownership or any connection with the\n              account in individual capacity or as a trustee or as a beneficiary in any\n              form, has it been notified to HSBC Geneva?\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_52\">              (b)     Did she or the trust or any other person or beneficiary report income\n              which accrued or arisen from the account after she came to notice the\n              existence of account at least to Indian IT authorities or authorities in any\n              other tax jurisdiction?\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_53\">              (c)     What is the status of the account now?

These are strong\n       background factors which goes against the appellant and cements the case against\n       her.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_55\">       28.     In paragraph 8 and 9 of this order matters concerning the Affidavit was\n       discussed. The background is that the Assessing Officer sought an affidavit in\n       course of proceedings before him but was not filed. As a substitute for same it as\n       filed before me as additional evidence in paragraph 9 of this order. Nevertheless it\n       is an affidavit. The legal position on affidavit is already discussed. As evidence to\n       buttress the contents of the affidavit and since many questions were left\n       unanswered along with the fact that consent waiver form was never filed during\n       assessment proceedings, I do not accept the contents in view of otherwise strong\n       evidences against the appellant. I course of hearing before me it was stated that\n       they are ready for giving open consent for any enquiry. Collection of information\n       has a procedure as per tax treaty between sovereign nations. It is not to be at will\n       and at inappropriate time, the appropriate time being when Assessing Officer\n       sought the same. Considering all aspects, I disregard the contents of the affidavit.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_56\">       29.    The Appellant relied on many case decisions. In none of the cases the\n       combination of facts brought out in this case applies. Hence they are not\n       considered. Also produced is order of CIT(Appeals) -56, Mumbai circumstances. I\n       find that the fact brought out in this case is different and far more and same which\n       according to Appellant is on identical cannot be adopted as such. Only when facts\n       and circumstances are identical rules of precedence is followed. That is not the case\n       here. The layering/structure of entities, information on the case etc are different.\n       Hence they were not considered.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_57\">       30.    In view of foregoing discussion, I hold that the Assessing Officer has\n       approached the assessment correctly in assessing income as per the base note\n       received from French Government.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_58\">18.     Coming to the quantum of additions, however, learned CIT(A) upheld the stand of the\nassessee, and gave certain directions to the Assessing Officer, which are reproduced below\nfor ready reference:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_49\">       31.   Coming to quantum of income to be assessed (raised against revised\n       grounds 22 and 27) the objection of appellant is that the addition is not correct.

This however is a matter of computation.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_59\">       Upon perusal of the base note it is seen that the entries are styled as if it is normal\n       banking transaction with debit/credit entries titled &quot;Mutual Fund&quot;, &quot;Liquid\n       assets&quot;, &quot;Stocks&quot;, &quot;Structured Products&quot;, &quot;Advances and Loans&quot;, &quot;Bonds&quot;,\n       &quot;Fiduciary Deposits&quot; etc.. Nevertheless it is debit and credit entries. Since a\n       finding is made that the income on the basis of information contained in the base\n       note is assessable under <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_37\">Income Tax Act</a> 1961, correct computation is necessary.\n       The assessing officer can assess only such sums that fit into definition of <a href=\"/doc/641728/\" id=\"a_38\">sections\n       5(2)</a> r.w 8 r.w 9 r.w 69,69A,69B, as applicable in the case, emanating from the base\n       note. Any other computation will be incorrect. Further, according to appellant there\n       is duplication over months within the year.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_60\">       32.     In view of discussion is para 31, the Assessing Officer is directed to assess\n       only such sums, confining to information in base note and assessable under the\n       provisions of <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_39\">Income Tax Act</a> 1961 and subject to other finding in this order. For\n       this the Assessing Officer may direct assessee to furnish detailed computation and\n       after examination of the same (if filed) decide on quantum of income to be retained\n       considering the data contained in the base note and those emanating from the\n       same. Any duplication, that had occurred, must be deleted. No order prejudicial to\n       assessee should be passed without granting opportunity of being heard.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_61\">19.    So far as these directions are concerned, the matter rests there. It appears that the\nassessee has not furnished any information, or pursued the matter further. The assessee is in\nappeal on the addition being confirmed in principle.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_62\">Submissions of the parties:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_63\">20.      Learned counsel‟s contention is that when the account did not belong to the assessee,\nthere is no question of assessee being in a position to furnish any evidence in respect of the\nsame. He submits that he does not have information whatsoever about the source of deposits\nin this account, and the assets have held therein. It is pointed out that the account is held with\nGWU Investments Limited with which assessee has no relationship whatsoever. The assessee\nis at best a beneficiary of the discretionary trust, settled by GWU Investments Limited, but\nthen in such an eventuality, the question of taxability would arise only at the point of time\nwhen the assessee actually receives any money from the trust. Reliance is placed on the\njudgment of Hon‟ble Supreme Court, in the case of CWT Vs Estate of HMM Vikramsinhji\nof Gonda (supra), in support of this proposition. It is his submission that entire case of the\nAssessing Officer is based on gross misconception of facts and ignoring the well settled legal\nposition. He points out all these fallacies once again. The assessee does not have any account\nwith the HSBC Private Bank (Suisse) SA, and yet assessee is treated as owner of the account.\nThe account is of the investments, and it is treated as a bank account. The assessee is a non-\nresident, taxable in India in respect of its income earned in India, and yet the assessee is being\ntaxed in respect of an account which undisputedly has no connections with India. Denying\nthe tax liability in respect of such an account at all, it is submitted that if at all it has tax\nimplications anywhere in the world, this liability is in the jurisdiction of which the assessee is\na resident. The assessee is taxable only on disbursement of the benefits to the beneficiary, but\nthen the beneficiary is being taxed in respect of the corpus of the trust. Learned counsel thus\nsubmits that the impugned additions are, even on merits, wholly devoid of any substance. He,\nhowever, submits that all these aspects are wholly academic inasmuch as the reassessment\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_53\">                                                                                ITA No. 2333/Mum/2018</span>\n                                                                              Assessment year: 2006-07\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_54\">                                                                                         Page 22 of 55</span>\n\nitself is devoid of legally sustainable merits.

Learned Departmental Representative vehemently relies upon, and elaborately\njustifies, the orders of the authorities below. He submits that it is a case in which a specific\ninformation has come to in the possession of the Government of India, through official\nchannels, and this information, amongst other things, categorically indicates that the assessee\nwas beneficiary and beneficial owner of a particular account which had peak assets worth US\n$ 3,97,38,122. The genuineness of this account is not in doubt and has not even been\nchallenged by the assessee.       These realties cannot be wished away. The income tax\ndepartment has discharged its burden of proof by brining on record authentic information\nreceived from, through Government channels, about the bank relationships which were\nunaccounted in India and unaccounted abroad. Whatever documents the assessee has given\nare self-serving documents and hyper technical explanations, which do not contradict the\nofficial information received by the Government of India, through official channels, and it\ndoes in fact corroborate and evidence the existence of account with the assessee as\nbeneficiary, and, in any case, these documents cannot be considered enough to discharge\nburden of the assessee that the evidences are not genuine or the inescapable conclusions\nflowing from the same. All that the assessee says is that she has no idea as to who did it, and\npasses on the blame to a Cayman Island based company which was operating the said\naccount, but then Cayman Island company cannot be a person unconnected with the assessee.\nIt is inconceivable that a rank outsider will be generous enough to put that kind of huge\nmoney at her disposal or for her benefit, but, as a beneficiary, she is expected to know the\nrelated facts to which she alone knows. The fact of the Swiss Bank accounts being operated,\nthrough conduit companies based in tax havens, is a common knowledge, and, seen in this\nlight, if the assessee has an account for her benefit in a Swiss Bank- whether she operates her\ndirectly or through a web of proxies, the natural presumption is that this is her money which\nshe must account for. It is also pointed out that within months of her changing the residential\nstatus, this account was opened and the credits were afforded. Where did this money come\nfrom? Obviously, in such a short span of time, this kind of huge wealth of several millions of\ndollars cannot be earned by her abroad, but then if she has shown that kind of earning\nanywhere to any tax authorities, to that extent, the balance in Swiss account can be treated as\nexplained. He submits that all these technicalities, which are sought to be raised by the\nlearned counsel, are of no use and the judicial precedents, rendered in altogether different\ncontext, cannot be used to defend the unaccounted wealth stashed away in assessee‟s account\nwith HSBC Private Bank, Geneva. He then makes general submissions about the Swiss Bank\naccounts and makes reference to the unaccounted monies being stashed away therein. A\nquick reference is made to the HSBC Bank, Geneva, accounts coming to the light, for\nkeeping wealth hidden from taxmen, and the usual modus operendi of the same. It is\nsubmitted that people who use such anti social modes of keeping monies abroad, or are a\nparty to such manoeuvrings, deserve no leniency anywhere in the world. He reiterates that it\nis not the case of the assessee that the taxes are paid on this hidden wealth anywhere in the\nworld, and the assessee is simply living in denial by taking hyper-technical defences. We are\nthus urged to confirm the action of the authorities below and decline to interfere in the matter.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_84\">                                                                                ITA No. 2333/Mum/2018</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_101\">                                                                              Assessment year: 2006-07\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_85\">                                                                                         Page 36 of 55</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_102\">22.     In brief rejoinder, learned counsel submits that these sweeping generalizations have\nno relevance to the facts before us. The hard reality is that the account does not belong to the\nassessee, that there is no direct or indirect evidence to support that inference, that the assessee\nwas only a beneficiary of a trust but the taxability in her hands must, at best, be confined to\nthe monies actually received from the trust, that admittedly GWU Investments Ltd was owner\nof the account- in which neither the assessee is a director or a shareholder, and that, in any\ncase, nothing remains in the account as the same stands closed now. It is then reiterated that\nthe assessee is a non-resident and she cannot be taxed in respect of monies credited, even if\nthat be so, in her accounts outside India. He once again reiterates that there is no evidence\nwhatsoever of the assessee having account abroad, that whatever evidence has been given to\nthe assessee is successfully controverted by the assessee, that assessee is a non-resident and\nher taxability is confined to the incomes sourced in India, and that, for the detailed reasons\nadvanced by him, the impugned addition of Rs 196,46,79,146 in respect of assessee‟s alleged\nand non-existent bank account in HSBC Private Bank (Suisse) SA, Geneva, must be deleted.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_103\">Our analysis on the merits of the impugned addition of Rs 196,46,79,146 in respect of\nassessee‟s account with HSBC Private Bank (Suisse) SA, Geneva.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_104\">A: The backdrop\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_105\">23.    It is also important to recall the backdrop in which the information about assessee‟s\naccount with the HSBC Private Bank (Suisse) SA was received by the Government of India.\nThat will also refresh memories, and certain undisputed facts, about the &quot;HSBC Private Bank\nGeneva scandal&quot; as it is often referred to. In 2006, after a whistle-blower named Herve\nFalciani, an employee of HSBC Private Bank (Suisse) SA, Geneva, walked out with\ninformation on thousands of accounts, involving wealth hidden from taxmen, the bank came\nunder the glare of multiple regulators for helping wealthy individuals hide millions. The\nemployee fled to France, and in June 2011, the French government had shared the data on\nSwiss bank accounts with countries such as India, the US, UK, Canada and Australia&quot;. That‟s\nhow Government of India got the information about a large number of cases and this HSBC\nBank scandal, involving unaccounted monies stashed away in Swiss Bank accounts, was also\nsubject matter of Special Investigation Team set up under the chairmanship of former\nSupreme Court judge, Hon‟ble Justice M B Shah. The following BBC report about Herve\nFalciani, former HSBC Geneva employee, can perhaps throw some more light on the\nbackdrop:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_54\">       Revelations that HSBC, one of the world&#x27;s largest banks, helped some of its\n       wealthy clients evade hundreds of millions of dollars worth of tax have made\n       headlines across the world, but who is the man who lifted the lid on the scandal?\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_55\">       On 22 December 2008, police in Switzerland detained Herve Falciani in Geneva.\n       They interrogated the computer systems analyst for several hours, before\n       releasing him under strict instructions to return the following morning.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_56\">       Mr Falciani, however, rented a car, collected his wife and two daughters and\n       made a beeline for the French border. He telephoned the Swiss police from\n       southern France, telling them he wanted to spend Christmas with his family in\n       France, but that he would return in the new year.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_86\">                                                                  ITA No. 2333/Mum/2018</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_57\">                                                                Assessment year: 2006-07\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_87\">                                                                           Page 37 of 55</span>\n\nThe then-36-year-old dual French-Italian national did not make good on this\npromise, however, and Swiss authorities have been trying to get their hands on\nhim ever since, thus far to no avail.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_58\">Depending on who you believe, Herve Falciani is either a courageous\nwhistleblower responsible for exposing industrial-scale fraud at one of the\nworld&#x27;s largest banks that deprived governments in dozens of countries of many\nmillions of pounds, or a cynical, calculating criminal who maliciously stole\nsensitive data on tens of thousands of clients with the intention of lining his own\npockets.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_59\">Lebanon trip\nHerve Falciani grew up in Monaco, which, he says, made going into the financial\nsector an &quot;obvious choice&quot;. In 2000 he joined HSBC in the principality, before\ntransferring to HSBC Private Bank (Suisse) in Geneva, Switzerland six years\nlater.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_60\">Between 2006 and 2007, he collected confidential data on more than 106,000 of\nthe bank&#x27;s customers from more than 200 countries, pertaining to more than\n300,000 private accounts. Many of them belonged to prominent figures in\nbusiness, film, music, sport, and even the heads of royal families.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_61\">Thousands of pages pertaining to the accounts were obtained by French\nnewspaper Le Monde and shared with the BBC and more than 50 other\ninternational media outlets. The publication of their findings has raised\nquestions as to why HSBC did not do more to prevent tax evasion via its Swiss\nsubsidiary.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_62\">In early 2008, Herve Falciani flew to Lebanon with a colleague, Georgina\nMikhael. She says the pair were lovers, and that he had confessed to her that he\nhad joined HSBC in the first instance with the intention of obtaining sensitive\nclient data to sell on to third parties.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_63\">Herve Falciani transferred to HSBC Private Bank (Suisse) in 2006, having joined\nthe company in his native Monaco six years earlier\nHe denies any romantic connection between the pair, and says Ms Mikhael&#x27;s\ninvolvement came about after men claiming to be agents of the Israeli\nintelligence agency Mossad instructed him to visit Lebanese banks and inform\nthem of security breaches at HSBC Private Bank in order to dissuade clients\nfrom using clandestine money to fund terrorist activity.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_64\">The pair set up meetings with four Lebanese bank managers, and while Herve\nFalciani used a pseudonym, Georgina Mikhael used her real name, and was\npromptly put under surveillance by Swiss authorities. She was subsequently\nquestioned by police and gave Mr Falciani up, precipitating his arrest and flight\nfrom the country.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_65\">Upon arrival in France, he downloaded confidential data on HSBC Private Bank\naccounts from remote servers and passed on five disks to French authorities,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_88\">                                                                         ITA No. 2333/Mum/2018</span>\n                                                                       Assessment year: 2006-07\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_89\">                                                                                  Page 38 of 55</span>\n\n       who could not send him back to Switzerland because of laws preventing the\n       extradition of French citizens.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_66\">       &#x27;Speak the truth&#x27;\n\n       The French government, through then-Finance Minister Christine Lagarde, who\n       now heads the International Monetary Fund, in turn shared the data Mr\n       Falciani had passed to them with other governments&#x27; tax bodies, leading to a\n       number of prosecutions and orders for payment of outstanding taxes amounting\n       to hundreds of millions of dollars.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_67\">       Mr Falciani was arrested on a Swiss arrest warrant and detained for more than\n       five months in Spain in 2012.

These actions of the HSBC Private Bank (Suisse) SA have not gone unnoticed so far\nas law enforcement agencies.

A rather recent press\nrelease dated 10th December 2019 from the US Department of Justice, which indicates the\nnature of aftermath it had to face and the collusion it had in systematic tax evasion by\nunscrupulous taxpayers from different parts of the world, is as follows:\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_92\">                                                                              ITA No. 2333/Mum/2018</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_85\">                                                                            Assessment year: 2006-07\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_93\">                                                                                       Page 40 of 55</span>\n\n\n\n                                   Department of Justice\n                                    Office of Public Affairs\n\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\nTuesday, December 10, 2019\n\n  Justice Department Announces Deferred Prosecution\n    Agreement with HSBC Private Bank (Suisse) SA\nBank Admits to Helping U.S. Taxpayers Conceal Income and Assets from the United\n                  States; Agrees to Pay $192.35 Million Penalty\nHSBC Private Bank (Suisse) SA (HSBC Switzerland), a private bank headquartered in Geneva,\nhas entered into a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) with the Department of Justice\ntoday in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, announced Acting Deputy\nAssistant Attorney General Stuart M. Goldberg of the Department of Justice&#x27;s Tax Division,\nUnited States Attorney for the Southern District of Florida Ariana Fajardo Orshan, and Chief\nDon Fort for Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Criminal Investigation. HSBC Switzerland\nadmitted to conspiring with U.S. taxpayers to evade taxes and, as part of the agreement,\nHSBC Switzerland will pay $192.35 million in penalties.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_86\">&quot;HSBC Switzerland conspired with U.S. accountholders to conceal assets abroad and evade\ntaxes that every American must pay,&quot; said Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General Stuart\nM. Goldberg of the Department of Justice&#x27;s Tax Division. &quot;Banks, asset managers and other\nfinancial firms enable such crimes - and we will hold these institutions to account, right along\nwith the taxpayers that use them to facilitate and disguise illegal activities.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_87\">&quot;Financial institutions that conspire with U.S. accountholders to hide income in undeclared\nbank accounts abroad, to avoid being held accountable for tax obligations and augment\ncorporate profit, face substantial criminal and civil penalties for their illicit conduct,&quot; said U.\nS. Attorney Fajardo Orshan for the Southern District of Florida. &quot;In this case, HSBC\nSwitzerland will pay a total civil and criminal fine of more than $192 million, to include a civil\nforfeiture of $71.8 million, for proceeds illegally derived from their conduct. We remain\ncommitted to the investigation and prosecution of individuals who evade their taxes and the\nfinancial institutions that assist them in doing so.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_88\">&quot;Taxpayers and financial institutions each have the most basic responsibilities to pay taxes\nand report suspicious activity regarding financial transactions. When financial institutions\ndevise a massive tax evasion scheme and actually facilitate the activity, they not only must be\nheld accountable, they must take actions to ensure this behavior will not happen again,&quot; said\nDon Fort, Chief, IRS Criminal Investigation. &quot;The integrity of our nation&#x27;s tax system depends\non voluntary compliance and fair, consistent enforcement of the law. We owe it to all\nAmericans to hold financial institutions accountable just as we would hold individual\ntaxpayers accountable. Today&#x27;s DPA shows that engaging in this type of behavior has\nconsequences.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_111\">According to court documents, HSBC Switzerland admits that between 2000 and 2010 it\nconspired with its employees, third-party and wholly owned fiduciaries, and U.S. clients to: 1)\ndefraud the United States with respect to taxes; 2) commit tax evasion; and 3) file false federal\ntax returns. In 2002, the bank had approximately 720 undeclared U.S. client relationships,\nwith an aggregate value of more than $800 million. When the bank&#x27;s undeclared assets under\nmanagement reached their peak in 2007, HSBC Switzerland held approximately $1.26 billion\nin undeclared assets for U.S. clients.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_112\">According to the terms of the DPA, HSBC Switzerland will cooperate fully with the Tax\nDivision and the IRS. The DPA also requires HSBC Switzerland to affirmatively disclose\ninformation it may later uncover regarding U.S.-related accounts, as well as to disclose\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_94\">                                                                            ITA No. 2333/Mum/2018</span>\n                                                                          Assessment year: 2006-07\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_95\">                                                                                     Page 41 of 55</span>\n\ninformation consistent with the department&#x27;s Swiss Bank Program relating to accounts closed\nbetween Jan. 1, 2009 and Dec. 31, 2017. Under the DPA, prosecution against the bank for\nconspiracy will be deferred for an initial period of three years to allow HSBC Switzerland to\ndemonstrate good conduct. The agreement provides no protection for any individuals.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_113\">The $192.35 million penalty against HSBC Switzerland has three parts. First, HSBC\nSwitzerland has agreed to pay $60,600,000 in restitution to the IRS, which represents the\nunpaid taxes resulting from HSBC Switzerland&#x27;s participation in the conspiracy. Second,\nHSBC Switzerland agreed to forfeit $71,850,000 to the United States, which represents gross\nfees (not profits) that the bank earned on its undeclared accounts between 2000 and 2010.\nFinally, HSBC Switzerland agreed to pay a penalty of $59,900,000. This penalty amount takes\ninto consideration that HSBC Switzerland self-reported its conduct, conducted a thorough\ninternal investigation, provided client identifying information to the Tax Division, and\nextensively cooperated in a series of investigations and prosecutions, as well as implemented\nremedial measures to protect against the use of its services for tax evasion in the future.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_114\">According to court documents filed as part of the DPA, the bank assisted U.S.\nclients in concealing their offshore assets and income from U.S. taxing\nauthorities. To conceal its clients&#x27; assets and income from the IRS, HSBC\nSwitzerland employed a variety of methods, including relying on Swiss bank\nsecrecy to prevent disclosure to U.S. authorities, using code-name and\nnumbered accounts and hold-mail agreements, and maintaining accounts in the\nnames of nominee entities established in tax haven jurisdictions, such as the\nBritish Virgin Islands, Liechtenstein, and Panama, that concealed the client&#x27;s\nbeneficial ownership of the accounts.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_115\">In an effort to attract new U.S. clients, and maintain existing relationships with U.S. clients,\nHSBC Switzerland bankers took trips to the United States. Between 2005 and 2007, at least\nfour HSBC Switzerland bankers traveled to the United States to meet at least 25 different\nclients. One banker also attended Design Miami, a major annual arts and design event in\nMiami, Florida, in an effort to recruit new U.S. clients to open undeclared accounts with\nHSBC Switzerland.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_116\">In early 2008, in response to a public U.S. criminal investigation into UBS AG, the largest\nbank in Switzerland, for tax and securities violations in connection with its maintaining\nundeclared accounts for U.S. clients, HSBC Switzerland began a series of policy changes to\nrestrict its cross-border business with U.S. persons, but the bank did not immediately cease\nthat business. In fact, some HSBC Switzerland bankers assisted clients in closing their\naccounts in a manner that continued to conceal their offshore assets, such as withdrawing the\ncontents of their accounts in cash.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_117\">Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General Goldberg, U.S. Attorney Fajardo Orshan, and Chief\nFort commended special agents of IRS-Criminal Investigation, who investigated this case, as\nwell as Senior Litigation Counsel Mark F. Daly, Assistant Chief Jason H. Poole, and Trial\nAttorney Grace E. Albinson of the Tax Division, who prosecuted this case. Acting Deputy\nAssistant Attorney General Goldberg also thanked Assistant U.S. Attorneys Thomas P.\nLanigan and Danielle N. Croke of the Southern District of Florida, Assistant U.S. Attorney\nGordon Kromberg of the Eastern District of Virginia, and agents with the U.S. Postal Service\nfor their assistance in this case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_118\">Topic(s):\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_89\">Financial Fraud\nTax\n\nComponent(s):\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_90\">Tax Division\nUSAO - Florida, Southern\n\nPress Release Number:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_91\">19-1368\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_96\">                                                                              ITA No. 2333/Mum/2018</span>\n                                                                            Assessment year: 2006-07\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_97\">                                                                                       Page 42 of 55</span>\n\n\n\n          https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-deferred-prosecution-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_92\">                                                       agreement-hsbc-private-bank-suisse-sa\n\n                          [Emphasis, by underlining and by using bold letters, supplied by us]\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_119\">26.

Since a lot has been said about the assessee being a discretionary beneficiary of a trsut\nwhich is said to have the account with HSBC Private Bank (Suisse) SA Geneva, it may also\nbe of some use to understand the nature of trust services offered by HSBC Private Bank, as\nstated on their website even today. Some of the relevant extracts are as follows:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_93\">       Why consider trust and fiduciary services?\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_94\">       Trusts, foundations and other wealth structures help manage complex family\n       wealth scenarios.

Trusts\n       and other structures involve complex management, in addition to often\n       challenging financial and investment decisions.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_98\">       Basics of a trust\n       A trust is a private arrangement whereby you, as the settlor, transfer the legal\n       ownership of your assets (which then become the trust assets) to the trustee,\n       who manages and holds the assets for the benefit of the beneficiaries.

What is essentially implies that so far as the trust structures are concerned, it is a\nstructure, to use the words of the HSBC Private Bank- parent company of the HSBC Private\nBank (Suisse) SA Geneva, &quot;whereby you, as the settlor, transfer the legal ownership of\nyour assets (which then become the trust assets) to the trustee, who manages and holds\nthe assets for the benefit of the beneficiaries. The beneficiaries may include you and your\nfamily&quot;. The legal owner of the assets in a trust situation, even going by the HSBC Bank- as\nindeed a common knowledge, is a trustee in a fiduciary capacity and not the one who de facto\nowns the trust monies. It is also important to note that these trustees are sometimes provided\nby the HSBC Private Bank itself as the HSBC Private Bank takes pride in stating that their\n&quot;team is based across the globe and includes accountants, lawyers, bankers and trust\nspecialists, whose skills and experience form the basis of the service we provide&quot;. It is\nalso a common knowledge that trustees are often corporate entities based in the jurisdictions\nin which secrecy laws are very strict.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_123\">B: The asesseee‟s conduct- Running with the hare and hunting with the hounds:\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_100\">                                                                            ITA No. 2333/Mum/2018</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_104\">                                                                          Assessment year: 2006-07\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_101\">                                                                                     Page 44 of 55</span>\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_124\">29.     We must, at this stage, take note of the fact that the assessee had, in response to a\nspecific request from the Assessing Officer, declined to sign „consent waiver‟ so as to enable\nthe income tax department to obtain all the necessary details from the HSBC Private Bank\n(Suisse) SA, Geneva. This aspect of the matter is clear from the extracts from the assessee‟s\nsubmissions dated 25th February 2015 filed by the Assessing Officer, a copy of which is\nplaced at pages 47 (@ p 48) onwards in the paper-book filed by the assessee, as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_105\">       ........we would like to submit that the letter from HSBC Private Bank dated 5th\n       January 2015 categorically states that the assessee does not have any account in\n       HSBC Private Bank (Suisse) SA in Switzerland, hence question of providing you with\n       CD of HSBC Bank account statement does not arise.

The net effect of not signing the consent waiver form is that the Assessing Officer is\ndeprived of the opportunity to seek relevant information from the bank in respect of\nassessee‟s bank account. If she had nothing to hide, there was no reason for not signing the\nconsent waiver form. All that the consent waiver form does is waive any objection to the\nfurnishing of information relating to assessee‟s bank account, i.e. HSBC Private Bank\n(Suisse) SA Geneva in this case. It is necessary to take note of the above position so as to\nunderstand that the assessee has not come with clean hands, and, quite to the contrary, the\nassessee has made conscious efforts to scuttle income tax department‟s endeavours to get at\nthe truth.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_126\">31.

In connection with our cooperation, I\n       am/We are providing this waiver to the Income Tax Department, Government of\n       India.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_108\">       I/We hereby instruct and authorise HSBC Private Bank (Suisse) SA to provide\n       to me any and all documents in HSBC Private Bank (Suisse) SA‟s possession\n       relating to the above accounts. With this instruction, I/we waive all protections\n       under the data protection privacy and/ or bank secrecy laws of Switzerland.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_109\">       I/We understand that &quot;accounts records&quot; encompass all documents that a\n       customer is entitled to, including\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_110\">       -   documents identifying the account holder, the beneficial owner, and/ or\n           authorised persons;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_111\">       -   documents pertaining to foreign entities established or operated on behalf of\n           the Indian taxpayer;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_112\">       -   account opening documents;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_113\">       -   correspondence between the bank and customer and/or beneficiary and other\n           persons in relation to the account;\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_102\">                                                                            ITA No. 2333/Mum/2018</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_114\">                                                                          Assessment year: 2006-07\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_103\">                                                                                     Page 45 of 55</span>\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_115\">       -   account statement and statement of assets;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_127\">32.    Clearly, therefore, the consent waiver being furnished by the assessee does not put the\nassessee to any disadvantage so far as getting at the actual truth is concerned. Of course,\nwhen the monies so kept in such banks abroad are legal or the allegations incorrect, the\nassessee can always, and many a cases assesses do, cooperate the investigations by giving the\nconsent waivers.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_128\">33.    The case before us, however, is in the category of cases in which consent waiver has\nbeen emphatically declined by the assessee, and thus deeper probe by the income tax\ndepartment have been successfully scuttled.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_129\">C: Hon‟ble Bombay High Court on the assessee‟s declining such consent waivers:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_130\">34.     While on this aspect of the matter, it may also be useful to refer to a judgment of\nHon‟ble jurisdictional High Court on materially similar facts, wherein Their Lordships has\ndisapproved and deprecated the conduct of the assessee in not signing the consent waiver\nform, in the judgment reported as Soignee R Kothari Vs DCIT [(2016) 386 ITR 466\n(Bom)]. That was also a case in which the assessee, originally a resident in India, had\nmigrated to the USA. The information by way of a „base note‟ was received from the French\nGovernment, under the DTAA mechanism- as in this case, about existence of her bank\naccount with the same bank, i.e. HSBC Private Bank (Suisse) SA, Geneva. In this case,\naround US $ 45 million were found to in the said bank account around the same time i.e.\n2006, and assessee was one of the beneficiaries therein. It was in this backdrop that the\nassessment was sought to be reopened which was challenged in the writ petition before\nHon‟ble Bombay High Court. During the course of hearing of the writ petition, one of the\nargument advanced by the learned Additional Solicitor General, opposing the writ petition,\nwas that Hon‟ble High Court &quot;should not exercise its writ jurisdiction in favour of the\npetitioner as she has failed to sign the Consent Waiver Form&quot;. When the assessee was\nasked to clarify this position, as noted by Their Lordships, &quot;On instructions of the\nPetitioner, the Learned Senior Counsel Mr. Pardiwalla informed us that her Uncle Mr.\nDilip Mehta i.e the Executor of the Estate of late Mr. Ramniklal N Mehta was also\nwilling to sign a modified consent waiver form. Thus both the Petitioner and her uncle\nagreed to give a modified Consent Waiver Form in effect disputing being either the\nbeneficiary or being the person who has authority to operate the account&quot; but, as noted\nby Their Lordships, &quot;on enquiry by the Revenue from HSBC, Geneva, it was learnt that\na modified Consent Waiver Form would not enable the bank to give copies of the bank\nstatement of A/c. No. 5091404580 since the Waiver would have to be provided without\nmodifications&quot;. Their Lordships then noted that neither the assessee has furnished the\nrequisite information nor allowed the authorities to collect the information by giving\nunqualified consent waiver forms, and added that &quot;In the normal course of human conduct\nif a person has nothing to hide and serious allegations /questions are being raised about\nthe funds a person would make available the documents which would put to rest all\nquestions which seem to arise in the mind of the Authorities. The conduct on the part of\nthe Petitioner and her uncle, in not being forthcoming, to our mind leads us to the\nconclusion that this is not a fit case where we should exercise our extra ordinary writ\njurisdiction and/or interfere with the orders passed by the authorities under the Act. If\na person has nothing to hide, we believe the person would have co-operated in obtaining\nthe Bank Statements&quot;. Quite interestingly, in this case, when all these things came out in the\nopen, the petitioner sought leave to withdraw the petition, but even that prayer was rejected\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_104\">                                                                                 ITA No. 2333/Mum/2018</span>\n                                                                               Assessment year: 2006-07\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_105\">                                                                                          Page 46 of 55</span>\n\nby observing that, &quot;It may be pointed out that just before giving our reasoned order, Mr.\nNitesh Joshi, the learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioner sought permission to\nwithdraw this Petition. We declined. This is particularly, so as after having taken up\nsubstantial time of the Court and only after we expressed our final view that we are\ndismissing the Petition, an attempt is made to withdraw the petition. This cannot be\npermitted&quot;. That was a case in which even after the assessee was willing to sign a modified\nconsent waiver form, Their Lordship disapproved the conduct of the assessee in no uncertain\nterms. Here is a case, in which the assessee has declined to sign the consent waiver form\noutright, and taken a stand that the question of signing the consent waiver form does not\narise. Neither such a conduct can be appreciated, nor anyone with such a conduct merits any\nleniency.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_131\">35.     On the one hand thus, the assessee has not cooperated with the income tax authorities\nin obtaining the relevant information from HSBC Private Bank (Suisse) SA, Geneva, or\nrather obstructed the flow of full, complete and correct information from the said bank by not\nwaiving her rights to protect privacy for transactions with the bank, and, on the other hand,\nthe assessee has complained that the income tax authorities have not been able to find\nrelevant information. Obviously, these things cannot go together.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_132\">D: Justification for adverse inferences when consent waivers are declined:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_133\">36.      It is thus clear that when an assessee declines to give consent waivers about a bank\ninformation being collected, the assessee effectively stalls further investigation about the\nsame. Declining consent waiver is, for all practical purposes, enforcing the right of privacy,\nand enforcing the right to privacy, in the course of an income tax investigation about a\ntransaction, stalling obtaining full, complete and correct information about the same. The\npresumption thus has to be that such information, as in possession of the income tax\ndepartment and in respect of which the assessee has declined „consent waiver‟ for further\nprobe, is correct, and that the assessee is consciously trying to stall further probe in the matter\nso as to prevent further information, prejudicial to the interests of the assessee, coming to the\nlight. When an assessee seeks protection on account of the position that the income tax\ndepartment has not conclusively proved the things against the assessee, the assessee also has\nto show that he contributed to the efforts for getting at the truth or at least that he did not stall\nthe efforts of the income tax department to get at the truth. By not signing the consent\nwaiver, the assessee ends up protecting the actual facts coming to the lights by enforcing his\nown privacy under the Swiss secrecy and data protection laws, and, therefore, he cannot\nclaim protection of the position that the income tax department has not conclusively\nestablished the alleged facts. In such circumstances, in our humble understanding, the\nAssessing Officer has no choice but to draw an adverse inference. Of course, all the\nevidences furnished by the assessee are to be considered nevertheless, but, when such\nevidences turn out to be unreliable, inconclusive or insufficient, in our considered view, even\nadverse inference could indeed be justified.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_134\">E: The base note received about the assessee account with HSBC Private Bank (Suisse)\nSA, Geneva\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_135\">37.

The above base note also, under the heading „autres personnes liés aux profils\nclients‟, information about &quot;other people linked to customer profiles&quot; which includes\ninformation about two other family trusts, namely „Visions for the future‟ and „The Children\nHope Foundation‟, and HSBC International Trustees Limited, Cayman Islands branch, as also\nsome other individuals- apparently family members.

It is an interesting coincidence, coincidence if it is, that within a short time of the\ninformation about the above account coming to the possession of the Government of India,\nthis account was closed. Whatever assets were being held in this bank account were thus\ntransferred back to GWU Investments Limited, a company based in Cayman Islands- a tax\nhaven where it is almost impossible to find out about beneficial owners of a corporate entity,\nas it is not having &quot;a regular system of monitoring of compliance with ownership and identity\ninformation keeping requirements in respect of companies and partnerships&quot;, as very mildly\nput in a peer review report- as stated in Rahul Navin‟s &quot;Information Exchange and Tax\nTransparency: Tackling Global Tax Evasion and Avoidance&quot; (ISBN-10: 9350358891).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_142\">41.     It must also be a coincidence, coincidence if it could be, that the process of covering\nthe tracks did not stop with closure of the HSBC account. It is a further coincidence that even\nthe GWU Investments Limited, after the disclosure in respect of account, was closed as its\nname is struck off from the records of Registrar of Companies, Cayman Islands. As a\nCayman Islands Government notification, available in public domain at\nhttp://www.gov.ky/portal/pls/portal/docs/1/11574085.PDF, shows at page 45 of 102, GWU\nInvestments Limited no longer exists in the records of the Government of Cayman Islands.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_110\">                                                                              ITA No. 2333/Mum/2018</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_143\">                                                                            Assessment year: 2006-07\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_111\">                                                                                       Page 49 of 55</span>\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_144\">42.     Interestingly, however, even this trust stands terminated and nothing is now known\nabout the trust. We have noted that the assessee has taken a plea that she has nothing to do\nwith the funds in the HSBC Private Bank (Suisse) SA account, as she was only a beneficiary\nof the Tharani Family Settlement Trust. The assessee is at least, by her own admission, a\nbeneficiary of the trust but she is not in a position to throw any light about the trust or\nenlighten anyone about the trust structure. All she has submitted is that GWU Investments\nLimited is the company that runs the trust and she has no idea as to where the monies came in\nthe possession of GWU Investments Ltd. In letter dated 7th March 2015, a copy of which is\nplaced before us at pages 57-58 of the paper-book also, the submissions of the assessee was\nas follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_116\">       With reference to your query on the date of last hearing held on 26th February 2015,\n       wherein you wanted to know the following facts:\n</blockquote>\n<pre id=\"pre_13\">       (1)    Who is settlor of Tharani Family Trust, and\n       (2)    What are the sources of funds which are deposited in GWU Investments Ltd\n\n</pre><blockquote id=\"blockquote_117\">       To this, we would like to reiterate the fact that the assessee is neither a shareholder\n       nor a director in GWU Investments Limited, which is an underlying company of\n       Tharani Family Trust. Hence, the assessee is in no position to give you the details as\n       to what are the sources of funds which are deposited in GWU Investments Ltd.\n       Furthermore, she is also not signatory to the above said account belonging to GWU\n       Investments bearing number 1414771. In the light of the above said facts, she is\n       unable to provide you the above said details.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_118\">       Moreover, the assessee is neither the settler nor a trustee of Tharani Family Trust, she\n       is just a discretionary beneficiary of the above trust, wherein she has not received any\n       assets or funds at the time of disbursement. She does not have any knowledge as to\n       who is settlor of the trust. Finally, the trust has now been terminated, hence it will not\n       be possible for us to obtain any information about the trust. We now enclose herewith\n       letter from HSBC Private Bank (Suisse) SA dated 26/02/2015 which confirms the\n       above said facts.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_119\">       In light of the above said facts, GWU Investments Ltd is a completely separate\n       distinct entity in the eyes of law, and hence, under no circumstances, can anyone treat\n       the bank account in the name of GWU Investments Ltd as the bank account of the\n       assessee and thereby tax the deposits in her hand. In light of the above said facts, the\n       return of income filed by the assessee is correct, and hence there is no reason for\n       making any addition to the returned income.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_120\">       With this, we have submitted you all the details called for.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_121\">42.    To put a question to ourselves, is it an explanation which can be accepted by any\nreasonable person?\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_122\">43.    Let us also not lose sight of the fact, as we have noted earlier, that HSBC Private\nBank even today publicly offers assistance, in trust structures, whereby you, as the settlor,\ntransfer the legal ownership of your assets (which then become the trust assets) to the\ntrustee, who manages and holds the assets for the benefit of the beneficiaries, and the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_112\">                                                                              ITA No. 2333/Mum/2018</span>\n                                                                            Assessment year: 2006-07\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_113\">                                                                                       Page 50 of 55</span>\n\nbeneficiaries may include you and your family&quot;. It is also proudly stated on the bank\nwebsite itself that their &quot;team is based across the globe and includes..........trust\nspecialists, whose skills and experience form the basis of the service we provide&quot;. We\nhave also seen as to how the HSBC Private Bank (Suisse) SA has been indicted by several\nGovernments worldwide and how it has even confessed to be being involved in money\nlaundering.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_123\">44.      The assessee states that she is neither a shareholder nor a director in GWU\nInvestments Ltd. That‟s not even in dispute. GWU Investments Ltd is a Cayman Islands\nentity, and it needs no special knowledge to know that, more as a rule rather than as an\nexception, the Cayman Island entities are owned by nominees of the beneficial owners. The\noperations carried out by these entities, are mainly to facilitate financial manoeuvring for the\nbenefit of its clients, or, with that predominant underlying objective, to give the colour of\ngenuineness to these entities. These offshore entities, which are routinely used to launder\nunaccounted monies, are a fact of life, and as much a part of the underbelly of the financial\nworld, as many other evils. Even a layman, much less a Member of this specialized Tribunal,\ncannot be oblivious of these ground realities. Nothing, therefore, really turns on the assessee\nnot being a director or shareholder of the GWU Investments Ltd. The relevant question is\nwhether she is beneficial owner of the said company or not. HSBC documents show that she\nis the beneficial owner, and there is nothing, save and except for self-serving statements of\nthe assessee and contents of some unverified and uncorroborated letter of functionary of\nHSBC Private Bank- which has been indicted in several parts of the world for colluding with\nunscrupulous tax evaders and money launderers, to controvert that position. It is also\ninconceivable that a Rs 200 crore beneficiary in a trust will not know about who has settled\nthat trust. Similarly, while dealing with Cayman Island entities, living in denial about\nbeneficial ownerships, and confining to legal ownerships, is preposterous. The claim of the\nassessee, about a thing which is not in the knowledge of the Assessing Officer and further\ninvestigations about which are stalled by the assessee, is to be examined in the light of real\nlife probabilities and the very act of the assessee, in stalling the further probe, works against\nthe assessee. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1088510\" id=\"span_114\">The assessee may have something to say and some evidences to file. These\nevidences and statements cannot always be accepted at the face value without application of\nmind about their reliability. A conscious call is to be taken, in a fair and objective but a\nrealistic, manner about reliability of such evidence. As observed by Hon‟ble Supreme Court,\nin the case of <a href=\"/doc/1088510/\" id=\"a_63\">CIT Vs Durga Prasad More</a> [(1971) 82 ITR 540 (SC)], &quot;Science has not yet\ninvented any instrument to test the reliability of the evidence placed before a court or\ntribunal. Therefore, the courts and Tribunals have to judge the evidence before them by\napplying the test of human probabilities&quot;. As Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court has observed, in this\ncase, &quot;..it is true that an apparent must be considered real until it is shown that there are\nreasons to believe that the apparent is not the real party who relies on a recital in a deed\nhas to establish the truth of those recitals, otherwise it will be very easy to make self-</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_145\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1088510\" id=\"span_115\">serving statements in documents either executed or taken by a party and rely on those\nrecitals. If all that an assessee who wants to evade tax is to have some recitals made in a\ndocument either executed by him or executed in his favour then the door will be left\nwide open to evade tax. A little probing was sufficient in the present case to show that\nthe apparent was not the real. The taxing authorities were not required to put on\nblinkers while looking at the documents produced before them. They were entitled to\nlook into the surrounding circumstances to find out the reality of the recitals made in\nthose documents&quot;. As a final fact finding authority, this Tribunal cannot be superficial in its\nassessment of genuineness of a transaction, and our call is to be taken not only in the light of\nthe face value of the documents sighted by the assessee but also in the light of all the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_116\">                                                                              ITA No. 2333/Mum/2018</span>\n                                                                            Assessment year: 2006-07\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_117\">                                                                                       Page 51 of 55</span>\n\nsurrounding circumstances, preponderance of human probabilities and ground realties. There\nmay be difference in subjective perception on such issues, on the same set of facts, but that\ncannot be a reason enough for the fact finding authorities to avoid taking subjective calls on\nthese aspects, and remain confined to the findings on the basis of irrefutable evidences.\nHon&#x27;ble Supreme Court has, in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1088510/\" id=\"a_64\">Durga Prasad More</a> (supra), observed that &quot;human\nminds may differ as to the reliability of a piece of evidence but in that sphere the\ndecision of the final fact finding authority is made conclusive by law&quot;.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"805246\" id=\"span_118\">This faith in the\nTribunal by Hon&#x27;ble Courts above makes the job of the Tribunal even more onerous and\ndemanding and, in our considered view, it does require the Tribunal to take a holistic view of\nthe matter, in the light of surrounding circumstances, preponderance of probabilities and\nground realities, rather than being swayed by the not so convincing, but apparently in order,\nstatements and letters and examining them, in a pedantic manner, with the blinkers on. The\nsame has been the approach adopted by Hon‟ble Supreme Court, in the case of <a href=\"/doc/805246/\" id=\"a_65\">Sumati Dayal\nVs CIT</a> [(1995) 214 ITR 801 (SC)], wherein Their Lordships have, inter alia, disapproved\nacceptance of a claim of winning the appellant claims to have won in horse races a total\namount of Rs. 3,11,831 on 13 occasions out of which 10 winnings were from Jackpots and 3\nwere from Treble events by Chairman of the Income Tax Settlement Commission, and\nobserved that &quot;This, in our opinion, is a superficial approach to the problem. The matter\nhas to be considered in the light of human probabilities&quot;. Their Lordships further\nobserved that &quot;Similarly the observation by the Chairman that if it is alleged that these\ntickets were obtained through fraudulent means, it is upon the alleger to prove that it is\nso, ignores the reality. The transaction about purchase of winning ticket takes place in\nsecret and direct evidence about such purchase would be rarely available. An inference\nabout such a purchase has to be drawn on the basis of the circumstances available on\nthe record. Having regard to the conduct of the appellant as disclosed in her sworn\nstatement as well as other material on the record an inference could reasonably be\ndrawn that the winning tickets were purchased by the appellant after the event. We are,\ntherefore, unable to agree with the view of the Chairman in his dissenting opinion. In\nour opinion, the majority opinion after considering surrounding circumstances and\napplying the test of human probabilities has rightly concluded that the appellant&#x27;s claim\nabout the amount being her winning from races is not genuine. It cannot be said that\nthe explanation offered by the appellant in respect of the said amounts has been\nrejected unreasonably and that the finding that the said amounts are income of the\nappellant from other sources is not based on evidence&quot;.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_146\">45.      Viewed in the light of factual backdrop of the case, and in the light of the above legal\nposition, no reasonable person can accept the explanation of the assessee. The assessee is not\na public personality like Mother Terresa that some unknown person, with complete\nanonymity, will settle a trust to give her US $ 4 million, and in any case, Cayman Islands is\nnot known for philanthropists operating from there; if Cayman Islands is known for anything\nrelevant, it is known for an atmosphere conducive to hiding unaccounted wealth and money\nlaundering, and that does not advance the case of the assessee. This is a jurisdiction which\nhas double the number of companies than resident, most of which remain only on paper, and\nit will be no naïve to believe that these companies are located here, in a country with around\n65,000 residents, for bonafide core activities, rather than the benefits of anonymity, secrecy\nand liberal tax laws. Cayman Island is one of the few jurisdictions in the world where public\nrecords of the beneficiaries of firms and companies, like GWU Investments Ltd, are not\nmaintained, and it is only with effect from 2023, that is if the promises made by the\nGovernment of Cayman Islands can be believed at face value, that such public records will\nbe maintained. That is an ideal situation, as on now, for holding the unaccounted monies\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_119\">                                                                                   ITA No. 2333/Mum/2018</span>\n                                                                                 Assessment year: 2006-07\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_120\">                                                                                            Page 52 of 55</span>\n\nthrough a web of proxy corporate entities. The only persons who are privy to vital\ninformation about these transactions are the persons who are privy to these transactions-\nmaybe as owner, as settlor, as beneficiaries or as facilitators or even as accomplices in these\nmanoeuvrings, and when they decline to share the correct information, and thwart further\nprobe in the matter, investigations reach a cul-de-sac. The assessee before us is closely\ninvolved with the transaction and it is unconceivable that the assessee will have no direct\nknowledge of the owners of the underlying company and settlors of the trust which has her,\nas she herself puts it, as beneficiary of such a huge amount. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"805246\" id=\"span_121\">This inference is all the more\njustified when we take into account the fact that the assessee has been non-cooperative and\nhas declined to sign the consent waiver. One of the arguments raised by the assessee, as set\nout in a chart showing arguments of the assessee- below paragraph 20 earlier in this order,\nthat the assessee could not have performed the impossible act of signing consent waiver\nbecause she was not owner of the account is too naïve and frivolous to be even taken\nseriously. If the assessee was indeed not the owner of the account, there was all the more\nreason to sign the consent waiver form because it would have established that fact when the\nHSBC Private Bank (Suisse) Geneva was to decline the information on the basis of that\nconsent waiver. A consent waiver signed by the assessee would have been infructuous <a href=\"/doc/805246/\" id=\"a_66\">in that\ncase</a>, and it could not have done any harm to the assessee. Consent waiver form does not\nprejudice the claim of the assessee that he does not own the account in question; all it does is,\nas can be seen from the extracts from consent waiver form format reproduced earlier, is that it\nwaiver assessee‟s rights, if any, under the data protection and banking secrecy laws. The plea\nof the assessee, as noted earlier, is fit, if at all it is fit for anything, only to be rejected.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"805246\" id=\"span_122\">It is\nonly elementary that direct evidence of illegal transactions of the assessee, as indicated by\nHon‟ble Supreme Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/805246/\" id=\"a_67\">Sumati Dayal</a> (supra), &quot;would be rarely available&quot; as\nsuch transactions &quot;take place in secret&quot;, and therefore, simply on the ground that such\ndirect evidence is not brought on record by the revenue authorities, the assessee cannot go\nscot free. As observed by Hon‟ble Supreme Court in the said case, &quot;it is upon the alleger to\nprove that it is so, ignores the reality&quot;.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"805246\" id=\"span_123\">When we follow the path, as <a href=\"/doc/805246/\" id=\"a_68\">laid down by</a> Hon‟ble\nSupreme Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/805246/\" id=\"a_69\">Sumati Dayal</a> (supra), by &quot;considering surrounding\ncircumstances and applying the test of human probabilities&quot; and donot take &quot;a\nsuperficial approach to the problem&quot;, the inescapable conclusion is that the explanation of\nthe assessee is only fit to be rejected. In the present case, there is even direct evidence\navailable on record. As the base note categorically states, this is &quot;synthèse individuelle&quot;</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_124\">(individual synthesis, in literal meaning, which refers to „individual‟s profile‟) and name of\nthe person is Renu Tikamdas Tharani, and her address is under the heading &quot;Adresses de la\npersonne physique&quot; (i.e. addresses of the natural person). In the heading &quot;Profils client\nlies a la personne&quot; (i.e. customer profiles linked to the person), GWU Investments Limited is\nshown as Nom du profil client (customer profile name) but then the same note shows nature\nde profil (i.e. profile nature) as Nominatif (nominative, or nominal) and that the Détails du\nlien ( i.e. link details) between the individual and the company is that of &quot;beneficiary/\nbeneficial ownership&quot;. It is important to note that the reference to &quot;link details&quot; is in respect\nof customer profile name, which is stated to be GWU Investments Limited, and only an\nindividual can be beneficiary of the company or beneficial owner of the company, and not the\nother way round. There is no reference to Tharani Family Trust at this stage and in this\nsection of the base note. That comes at the fag end of the base note under the heading\n&quot;personnes légales liées&quot; ( i.e. related legal persons). Clearly, therefore, the link details, or\n&quot;détails du lien&quot;, are between the individual and GWU Investments Limited, and these link\ndetails clearly show that the assessee is a beneficiary and beneficial owner of the GWU\nInvestments Ltd.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_124\">                                                                               ITA No. 2333/Mum/2018</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_125\">                                                                             Assessment year: 2006-07\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_125\">                                                                                        Page 53 of 55</span>\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_147\">46.      While we have noted the claim of the assessee that she is a discretionary beneficiary\nof Tharani Family Trust, that fact does not find mention in the base note. As we have clearly\nanalyzed above, the base note shows that the assessee was beneficial owner or beneficiary of\nGWU Investments Ltd. We may add that in the remand report filed by the Assessing Officer,\nthere is a reference to some unsigned draft copy of the trust deed having been filed before\nhim but neither this deed is authentic nor is it placed before us in the paper-book. The\nassessee has not submitted the trust deed or any related papers but merely referred to a\nsomewhat tentative claim made in a letter between one Mahesh Tharani, apparently a\nrelative of the assessee and the HSBC Private Bank (Suisse) SA- an organization with a\nglobally established track record of hoodwinking tax authorities worldwide. All that this\nletter, addressed to one Mahesh Tharani, states is &quot;As per the request of director, we\nhereby confirm that, GWU Investments Ltd was holder of the account 1414771.\nAccording to our records GWU Investments Ltd. Used to be an underlying company of\nthe Tharani Family Trust for which Mrs. Renu Tharani was a discretionary\nbeneficiary. To the best of our knowledge, The Tharani Family Trust was terminated\nand none of the assets deposited with HSBC Private Bank (Suisse) SA were distributed\nto Mrs. Renu Tharani&quot;. It is not clear as to how is the director, and of which company; if\nMahesh Tharani was a director of GWU Investments Ltd, when he could share this letter, he\ncould have as well shared the information. If he is not the director, he would have at least\nknown the director because director requested the Bank to provide this information to\nTharani. Nothing is clear, nor does the assessee throw any light on the same. Be that as it\nmay, this letter does not show deny, nor show any material to controvert, what is stated in the\nbase note i.e. GWU Investments Ltd and the assessee are linked as beneficial owner. There is\nno dispute that account was in the nominal name of GSW Investments Ltd but the question is\nwho is the natural person beneficial owner thereof. As for the Trust, there is no corroborative\nevidence about the statement, but nothing turns thereon as well. The assessee being\ndiscretionary beneficiary owner of the trust, and beneficial owner of the underlying company,\nis not mutually exclusive anyway but the claim of the assessee being a discretionary\nbeneficiary of the trust is without even minimal evidence. There is another letter from\nHSBC Private Bank (Suisse) SA to the assessee which states that &quot;Further to your request,\nwe hereby confirm that you, Mrs Renu Tharani, are not the holder nor, to the best of\nour knowledge, the beneficial owner of any account opened in the books of HSBC\nPrivate Bank (Suisse) SA. However, you are a discretionary beneficiary of a trust called\nthe Tharani family Trust for which HSBC Guyerzeller Trust Company, acts as trustee.\nNo bank account is maintained in the name of the trustee, and we confirm that you are\nnot, nor have your even been, an authorized signatory on the bank account held in the\nname of the trust‟s underlying company&quot;. As for the first statement made in this letter, it\ndoes not show why the base note records assessee as the beneficial owner of the company,\nand how does the bank reconcile these two conflicting positions taken. As regards the\nassessee being a discretionary beneficiary, nothing turns on it anyway for the reasons we\nhave discussed earlier in this paragraph. As for assessee not being authorised signatory for\nGWU Investments Ltd, that is not even the case of the assessee or the position taken in the\nbase note. An HSBC entity, i.e, HSBC Guyerzeller Trust Company, being a trustee for\nTharani Family Trust shows that if it was indeed desired by the assessee, trust deed would\nhave been available with the HSBC entity. It‟s a also a coincidence that with all this available\ninformation, neither the assessee asks for the trust deed nor does the HSBC share the same.\nOn the contrary, assessee, in one of the communications to the Assessing Officer, specifically\nstates her inability to furnish the same. What these letters state may have some truth- half\ntruth or technical truth, but then these qualified truths are only different forms of falsehood in\nentirety. There is something seriously amiss in all this; something is rotten in the State of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_126\">                                                                             ITA No. 2333/Mum/2018</span>\n                                                                           Assessment year: 2006-07\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_127\">                                                                                      Page 54 of 55</span>\n\nDenmark. There is a series of coincidences, right from the HSBC account being closed after\nthe information contained in the base note coming out and to the underlying company being\nremoved from the name of Register of Companies in Cayman Island, right from assessee\nliving in complete denial about any knowledge about a HSBC Private Bank (Suisse) SA\naccount in her name to her lack of information about the company which is holding US $ 4\nmillion for her, and, despite assessee being purportedly so clean in her affairs, her thwarting\nany efforts of the income tax department to get at the truth by declining to sign the consent\nwaiver form. It is wholly un-understandable as to how can assessee, on one hand, seek to\ntreat a cleverly worded private letter from HSBC Private Bank (Suisse) SA as gospel truth,\nand, on the other hand, effectively stall, by declining consent waiver and by stating half\ntruths- even if her statements have an element of truth, the Assessing Officer obtaining direct\ninformation from the same organization. There is no meeting ground in this approach. In any\ncase, for the reasons set out above and as evident from the base note, the assessee is\nbeneficial owner of GWU Investments Ltd, Cayman Islands. There is nothing to controvert\nthis fact stated in the base note, and since the assessee has declined consent waiver in this\ncase, the assessee cannot decline correctness of the details obtained from the HSBC Private\nBank (Suisse) SA.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_148\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"31368495\" id=\"span_128\">47.     As regards the repeated references to Hon‟ble Supreme Court‟s judgment in the case\nof <a href=\"/doc/31368495/\" id=\"a_70\">Estate of HMM Vikramsinhji of Gonda</a> (supra), it is important to understand that it was\na case in which a discretionary trust was settled by the assessee and the limited question for\nadjudication was taxability of income of the trust, after the death of the settlor and in the\nhands of the beneficiary. It was in this context that Hon‟ble Supreme Court held that the\nquestion of taxation in the hands of the beneficiary arises only when he receives the money\nbecause, as Their Lordships noted, &quot;A discretionary trust is one which gives a beneficiary\nno right to any part of the income of the trust property, but vests in the trustees a\ndiscretionary power to pay him, or apply for his benefit, such part of the income as they\nthink fit. The trustees must exercise their discretion as and when the income becomes\navailable, but if they fail to distribute in due time, the power is not extinguished so that\nthey can distribute later. They have no power to bind themselves for the future. The\nbeneficiary thus has no more than a hope that the discretion will be exercised in his\nfavour.&quot; These observations have no relevance in the present context. Firstly, neither there is\nany trust deed before us, nor the question before us pertains to taxability of income of the\ntrust. Secondly, beyond a mention in the base note as a personnes légales liées&quot; (i.e. related\nlegal persons), there is no evidence even about existence, leave aside nature, of the trust.\nThirdly, the point of taxability here is beneficial ownership of GWU Investments Ltd, a\nCayman Island based company, by the assessee. Finally, even if there is a dispute about the\nalleged trust, the dispute is with respect of taxability of funds found with the trust and the\nsource thereof. Clearly, therefore, the issue adjudicated upon in <a href=\"/doc/31368495/\" id=\"a_71\">the said decision</a> has no\nrelevance in the present context. The very reliance on <a href=\"/doc/31368495/\" id=\"a_72\">the said decision</a> presupposes that the\nassessee was discretionary beneficiary simplicitor of a discretionary family trust, and nothing\nmore- an assumption which is far from established on the facts of this case.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_149\">48.     As regards the question of income which can be brought to tax in the hands of the\nassessee being a non-resident and certain errors in computations on account of duplicity of\nentries etc, we have noted that the learned CIT(A) has given certain directions which we have\nreproduced below paragraph 18 of this order, and neither these directions are challenged nor\nany infirmities are shown therein. Obviously, therefore, there is no occasion, or even prayer,\nfor interference in the same.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_129\">                                                                             ITA No. 2333/Mum/2018</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_150\">                                                                           Assessment year: 2006-07\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_130\">                                                                                      Page 55 of 55</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_151\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"75108414\" id=\"span_131\">49.     As we part with the matter, we have a couple of observations to make. The first\nobservation is that we must add that though the hearing in this case was concluded on 28th\nJanuary 2020, in view of Covid-19 lockdown in Mumbai city- which is, for all practical\npurposes, still continuing, with limited functionality of our office, the order is being\npronouncement today on 16th July 2020. However, in the light of a coordinate bench decision\nin the case of <a href=\"/doc/75108414/\" id=\"a_73\">DCIT Vs JSW Limited</a>, and vice versa [(2020) 116 taxmann.com 565\n(Mum)], the period of lockdown is to be excluded in computation of 90 days period. As\nfurther noted in the said order, Hon‟ble Bombay High Court has observed that &quot;while\ncalculating the time for disposal of matters made time-bound by this Court, the period\nfor which the order dated 26th March 2020 continues to operate shall be added and\ntime shall stand extended accordingly&quot; and the said order continued to operate till 15th July\n2020. Viewed thus, this order is being passed within the permissible time limit in terms of\nHon‟ble High Court‟s directions. The second point is that this decision cannot be an authority\nfor the proposition that wherever name of the assessee figures in a base note from HSBC\nPrivate Bank (Suisse) SA Geneva, an addition will be justified in each case. The mere fact of\nan account in HSBC Private Bank (Suisse) SA Geneva, by itself, cannot mean that the\nmonies in the account are unaccounted, illegitimate or illegal. The conduct of the assessee,\nactual facts of each case and the surrounding circumstances are to be examined, on merits,\nand then a call is to be taken about as to whether the explanation of the assessee merits\nacceptance or not. There cannot be a short cut and one size fits all approach to this exercise.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_152\">Our conclusions on correctness of addition of Rs 196.46 crores in relation to HSBC\nPrivate Bank (Suisse) SA, Geneva\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_153\">50.
