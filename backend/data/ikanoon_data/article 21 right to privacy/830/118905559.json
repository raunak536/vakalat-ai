However, the husband of the petitioner does not pay any heed\n\nto   the   same.   On   the   other   hand,   it   is   claimed   that   the   petitioner\n\nbeing a patient of epilepsy is unable to consume oral contraceptives\n\non   account   of   potential   reaction   with   the   drugs   that   she   has\n\nadministered for treating her epilepsy. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_13\">\n\n6          In view of constant mental and physical cruelty, the petitioner\n\ncame back to her parental house after having diagnosed of carrying\n\npregnancy of about more than 20 weeks. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_14\">\n\n7          In   the   aforesaid   factual   background,   the   learned   counsel  for\n\nthe   petitioner   submits   that   the   petitioner   does   not   intend   to\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">  ::: Uploaded on - 04/07/2018                                                       ::: Downloaded on - 04/07/2018 22:59:27 :::</span>\n                                                                 5                                                          20.6430.18 wp.doc\n\n\ncontinue   with   the   pregnancy  as   she   intend   to   pursue   her  studies\n\nand   apply   for   divorce.

A plain reading of the above-quoted provision makes it\n           clear that Indian law allows for abortion only if the specified\n           conditions are met. <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_18\">When the MTP Act</a> was first enacted in\n           1971   it   was   largely   modelled   on   the   Abortion   Act   of   1967\n           which   had   been   passed   in   the   United   Kingdom.   The\n           legislative intent was to provide a qualified &#x27;right to abortion&#x27;\n           and the termination of pregnancy has never been recognised\n           as a normal recourse for expecting mothers. There is no doubt\n           that a woman&#x27;s right to make reproductive choices is also a\n           dimension of &#x27;personal liberty&#x27; as understood under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_19\">Article 21</a>\n           of the Constitution of India. It is important to recognise that\n           reproductive choices can be exercised to procreate as well as\n           to abstain from procreating. The crucial consideration is that\n           a   woman&#x27;s   right   to   privacy,   dignity   and   bodily   integrity\n           should   be   respected.

A plain reading of the above-quoted provision makes it\n           clear that Indian law allows for abortion only if the specified\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">  ::: Uploaded on - 04/07/2018                                                      ::: Downloaded on - 04/07/2018 22:59:27 :::</span>\n                                                                 17                                                          20.6430.18 wp.doc\n\n\n           conditions are met. <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_48\">When the MTP Act</a> was first enacted in\n           1971   it   was   largely   modelled   on   the   Abortion   Act   of   1967\n           which   had   been   passed   in   the   United   Kingdom.   The\n           legislative intent was to provide a qualified &#x27;right to abortion&#x27;\n           and the termination of pregnancy has never been recognised\n           as a normal recourse for expecting mothers. There is no doubt\n           that a woman&#x27;s right to make reproductive choices is also a\n           dimension of &#x27;personal liberty&#x27; as understood under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_49\">Article 21</a>\n           of the Constitution of India. It is important to recognise that\n           reproductive choices can be exercised to procreate as well as\n           to abstain from procreating. The crucial consideration is that\n           a   woman&#x27;s   right   to   privacy,   dignity   and   bodily   integrity\n           should   be   respected.   This   means   that   there   should   be   no\n           restriction whatsoever on the exercise of reproductive choices\n           such   as   a   woman&#x27;s   right   to   refuse   participation   in   sexual\n           activity or alternatively the insistence on use of contraceptive\n           methods. Furthermore, women are also free to choose birth-\n           control methods such as undergoing sterilisation procedures.\n           Taken to their logical conclusion, reproductive rights include a\n           woman&#x27;s entitlement to carry a pregnancy to its full term, to\n           give birth and to subsequently raise children. However, in the\n           case   of   pregnant   women   there   is   also   a   &#x27;compelling   state\n           interest&#x27;   in   protecting   the   life   of   the   prospective   child.\n           Therefore, the  termination of  a pregnancy is  only permitted\n           when the conditions specified in the applicable statute have\n           been fulfilled. Hence, the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/634810/\" id=\"a_50\">MTP Act, 1971</a> can\n           also   be   viewed   as   reasonable   restrictions   that   have   been\n           placed on the exercise of reproductive choices.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_36\">21         From the observations made by the Apex Court in the matter of\n\nSuchita Srivastava  and  Z  V/s.
