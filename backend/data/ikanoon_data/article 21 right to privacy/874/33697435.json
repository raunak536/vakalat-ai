However, the\n\n     constitutional import of the matter is such, that personal liberty, which may\n\n     only be taken away by a just and fair procedure established by law, needs\n\n     to be analyzed and protected. The issue is simple to state but hard to\n\n     answer. It is embedded in a maze of case law that this Court needs to\n\n     negotiate.               Simply put, the Court needs to answer whether the period of\n\n     remand under the first proviso to Sec. 167 (2) of the Code of Criminal\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">Digitally signed by</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">Jayant Kumar Arora</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">Date: 2023.03.28</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">17:42:40 IST</span>\n     Procedure, 1973 (hereinafter ‘<a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_1\">CrPC</a>’) is inclusive of the day on which the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">Reason:</span>\n\n\n\n\n     Magistrate orders remand.

These Appeals are directed against the order dated 20.08.2020 of the\n\nBombay High Court, granting default bail to the respondents under proviso\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_6\">(a) (ii) of <a href=\"/doc/839149/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 167 (2)</a> of the CrPC. The respondents were arrested on\n\n14.05.2020 for alleged commission of offence under <a href=\"/doc/1283441/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 3</a> of the\n\nPrevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (hereinafter ‘PMLA’) and were\n\nremanded on the same date. On 11.07.2020 through e-mail, the\n\nEnforcement Directorate (hereinafter ‘ED’) claimed to file a Complaint and\n\nsubsequently on 13.7.2020, i.e., a Monday, a physical copy thereof was\n\ntendered before the Court. The applications for enlargement of bail were\n\nmoved on 13.07.2020 at 8:53 AM, through e-mail and physical filing token\n\nbeing issued by 11 AM.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_7\">5. It was asserted by the respondents that the period of 60 days from the\n\ndate of remand i.e., 14.5.2020, expired on 12.7.2020 (Sunday) and on the\n\nnext day, the default bail applications were presented before the Court. The\n\nlearned Special Judge, however, denied default bail to the respondents\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">\f                                          3</span>\n\ntaking the view that the 60 day period would start from 15.5.2020, thereby\n\nexcluding the date of remand (i.e. 14.5.2020). However, the High Court,\n\nunder the impugned judgment felt that, excluding the date of remand while\n\ncomputing the 60- day period was erroneous and held that the filing of the\n\nChargesheet by the ED on 13.7.2020, being the 61st day, would entitle the\n\nrespondents to default bail. The aforesaid decision of the High Court was\n\nstayed by this Court on 3.9.2020.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">                                 ISSUES AND REFERENCE\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_9\">6.       The core issue that arises for consideration is whether the date of\n\nremand is to be included or excluded, for considering a claim for default\n\nbail, when computing the 60/90 day period as contemplated in proviso (a)\n\nof <a href=\"/doc/839149/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 167 (2)</a> of the CrPC. The moot question has been considered by\n\nthis Court in various cases, but there is a divergence of opinion on how the\n\nstipulated period, for the right of default bail, accruing to the accused, is to\n\nbe computed. Some judgements have favoured the exclusion of date of\n\nremand, while a contrary view is taken in other cases.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"88760594\" id=\"span_9\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"58810628\" id=\"span_10\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"100723270\" id=\"span_11\">7.

Due to the aforementioned conflict in law, a judicial conundrum has\n\narisen which is required to be resolved in this reference. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1615412\" id=\"span_15\">In <a href=\"/doc/1615412/\" id=\"a_10\">Chaganti</a>\n\n(supra), this Court while examining the legislative intent, with regard to\n\nconclusion of investigation within the statutory remand period, held that\n\nthe day of remand order should be included.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"100723270\" id=\"span_16\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"58810628\" id=\"span_17\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"88760594\" id=\"span_18\">On the other hand, the 3-judge\n\nbench in <a href=\"/doc/88760594/\" id=\"a_11\">M Ravindran</a> (supra), relied on <a href=\"/doc/58810628/\" id=\"a_12\">Ravi Prakash</a> (supra), which in turn\n\nfollowed the principle <a href=\"/doc/58810628/\" id=\"a_13\">laid down in</a> <a href=\"/doc/100723270/\" id=\"a_14\">Rustam</a> (supra) and declared that the\n\ndate of remand is to be excluded for computing the mandated 60/90 day\n\nperiod, in order to facilitate the accused’s right to default bail.</span></span></span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\">10.   The earlier position of law as declared in Chaganti was ignored in\n\nRustam. And since, Rustam later became the basis for excluding the date of\n\nremand from the stipulated period in Ravi Prakash and thereafter in\n\nRavindran, which is the latest decision of a 3-judge bench, it becomes\n\nnecessary for a bench of appropriate strength to settle the law taking note of\n\nthe earlier precedents and the confusion therein.

The two respondents, while being confined in judicial custody since\n\n10.5.2020 in RC No.219/2020 registered by the CBI, came to be arraigned\n\nas accused in ECIR/MBZO-I/3/2020 registered by the ED for the alleged\n\ncommission of offence under <a href=\"/doc/1283441/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 3</a> of the PMLA.              On 14.5.2020, the\n\napplicants were produced before the learned Special Court, Mumbai and\n\nwere then remanded to police custody and on 27.5.2020 were subsequently\n\nremanded to judicial custody. The High Court while granting default bail to\n\nthe applicants formulated the following question for decision:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">      “Whether in computing the remand period of 60 or 90 days as\n      contemplated in proviso (a) of <a href=\"/doc/839149/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 167 (2)</a> of CrPC, the day of\n      remand is to be included or excluded.”\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"154033650\" id=\"span_20\">13.    The applicants contended before the High Court that they were\n\narrested on 14.5.2020 and on the very same day, they were remanded by\n\nthe Magistrate and such remand orders came to be passed from time to\n\ntime. As per the ED, on 11.7.2020, (i.e. a Saturday), a complaint was filed\n\n\n9     <a href=\"/doc/154033650/\" id=\"a_18\">Gautam Navlakha Vs.

On 13.7.2020 i.e. Monday, the\n\nED filed the physical complaint before the Court. Based on these facts, the\n\napplicants’ counsel submitted that the period of 60 days from the date of\n\nremand of the applicants (14.5.2020) expired on 12.7.2020 (Sunday) and\n\nthe applicants on 13.7.2020 sought enlargement on default bail, under the\n\nproviso (a) (ii) of <a href=\"/doc/839149/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 167 (2)</a>, CrPC. Initially, the applications were\n\ntransmitted through e-mail at around 8:53 AM and after about two hours\n\non 13.7.2020, at around 11 AM, the bail applications were presented for\n\nphysical filing in the Sessions Court and a token acknowledging the filing\n\nwas issued and the applications were also numbered.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">14.

As per the ED,\n\nrelying on <a href=\"/doc/100723270/\" id=\"a_20\">Rustam</a>(supra), the 60 day period ends on 13.7.2020 (wherein it\n\nseeks to exclude the date of remand i.e. 14.5.2020). Thus, as per the ED,\n\ncomplaint was filed in time.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_18\">15.   The learned Special Court denied default bail on 14.7.2020 with the\n\nunderstanding that the 60 days’ time limit for filing the complaint expired.\n\nThe learned Judge opined that the date of remand will have to be excluded\n\nand the 60 days period will have to be computed from 15th May 2020. With\n\nthis reasoning the bail application came to be rejected.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_19\">16.   On respondents’ challenge to the rejection of their default bail\n\napplications, the High Court after analyzing the implication of the rival\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">\f                                           7</span>\n\nsubmissions     and       interpreting   the   statutory   provisions   and   their\n\napplications to the facts of the case, concluded that the learned Special\n\nJudge incorrectly excluded the date of remand, while computing the 60 day\n\nperiod. Since the chargesheet by the ED was filed on 13.7.2020, being\n\nbeyond 60 days by including the day of remand i.e. 14.5.2020, the\n\napplicants were found to be entitled to default bail. Accordingly, a direction\n\nwas issued for release of the respondents by adverting to the provisions of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/839149/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 167 (2)</a> of the CrPC, subject to the accused persons furnishing their\n\nbail bonds.

Naik J., who had analyzed the applicable provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_38\">CrPC</a>\n\nin the following paragraph.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_28\">      “ 7 . On perusal of aforesaid provision (<a href=\"/doc/1687975/\" id=\"a_39\">Sec. 167</a> CrPC), it may be seen\n      that sub-Section (1) is the mandatory provision, governing what a police\n      officer should do, when the person is arrested and detained in custody\n      and when it appears that the investigation cannot be completed within\n      the period of Twenty Four hours fixed by <a href=\"/doc/54715/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 57</a>. Sub-Section (2)\n      pertains to the powers of remand available to a Magistrate and the\n      manner in which, such powers should be exercised. The term of Sub-\n      Section (1) of Section 167 have to be read in conjunction with Section\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_29\">      57. It is clear that <a href=\"/doc/54715/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 57</a> interdicts a police officer from keeping in\n      custody a person without warrant for a longer period then Twenty Four\n      hours without production before the Magistrate, subject to the exception\n      that the time taken for performing the journey from the place of arrest to\n      the Magistrate Court, can be excluded from the prescribed period of\n      Twenty Four hours. Since, Sub-Section (1) provides that, if the\n      investigation cannot be completed, within the period of Twenty Four\n      hours, fixed by <a href=\"/doc/54715/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 57</a>, the accused has to be forwarded to the\n      Magistrate along with the entries in the diary, it follows that a police\n      officer is entitled to keep an arrested person in custody for a maximum\n      period of Twenty Four hours for the purposes of investigation. Hence,\n      the initial period of custody of an arrested person, till he is produced\n      before a Magistrate is neither referable to nor in pursuance of an order\n      of remand passed by a Magistrate. The powers of remand given to a\n      Magistrate, become exercisable after an accused is produced before him\n      in terms of Sub-Section (1) of Section 167. Sub-section (1) of Section 167\n      covers this procedure and also state that the police officer while\n      forwarding the accused to the nearest Magistrate should also transmit\n      a copy of entries in the diary relating to the case. The entries in the\n      diary are meant to afford to the Magistrate the necessary information\n      upon which he can take the decision whether the accused should be\n      detained in the custody or not. The law enjoins upon the investigating\n      agency to carry out the investigation, in a case where a person has\n\n14    MANU/MH/0843/2020; LD/VC Criminal Bail Application 197/2020.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">\f                                          10</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_30\">      been arrested and detained, with utmost urgency and complete the\n      investigation promptly in prescribed period. The proviso to sub-section\n      (2) fixes the outer limit within which investigation must be completed\n      and in case the same is not completed within the prescribed period, the\n      accused would acquire a right to be released on bail and if he is\n      prepared to and does furnish bail, the Magistrate shall release him on\n      bail and such release shall be deemed to be grant of bail under chapter\n      XXXIII of <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_43\">Cr.P.C</a>. The proviso inserted by Act No. 45 of 1978, comes into\n      operation where the Magistrate thinks fit that further detention beyond\n      the period of fifteen days is necessary and it lays down that, the\n      Magistrate may authorise the detention of the accused person\n      otherwise than in the custody of police beyond period of 15 days. The\n      proviso to Section 167(2) clearly state that the total period of detention\n      should not exceed Ninety days in cases where the investigation relates\n      to serious offences mentioned therein and sixty days in other cases and\n      if by that time charge-sheet is not filed on the expiry of said periods the\n      accused shall be released on bail.”\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_31\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"70748995\" id=\"span_39\">20.   The precedents referred to in the impugned judgment, and the\n\ncoordinate Bench in <a href=\"/doc/70748995/\" id=\"a_44\">Deepak Satyavan</a> (supra), show that the Court confers\n\npower on the prosecution to arrest a suspect and the investigation\n\ncontemplated under the Code would cover all the steps including\n\nproceedings for collection of evidence and on conclusion of the investigation\n\na report is required to be furnished under <a href=\"/doc/1412034/\" id=\"a_45\">Section 173</a> of the CrPC. The aim\n\nof Chapter XII is that investigation             should be completed without\n\nunnecessary delay, although there is no express outer limit for completion\n\nof investigation. The <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_46\">CrPC</a> prescribes, under Section 173(2), for filing the\n\nfinal report, which empowers the Court, to take cognizance of an offence. It\n\nalso allows for further investigation under sub-Section (8) of Section 173.\n\nFurther, as per Section 173(4), upon the final report being filed, if an\n\naccused has been released on bail, his bail bond maybe cancelled by the\n\nMagistrate based on merits of the investigation. Thus, the protection\n\nextended to an accused in lieu of proviso (a) of <a href=\"/doc/839149/\" id=\"a_47\">Section 167(2)</a> CrPC is only\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">\f                                     11</span>\n\nwith respect to the prescribed 60/90 day period, beyond which an accused’s\n\ncustody cannot be sought, even if the investigation is incomplete.</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_32\">21.   Unless a special order from a Magistrate is obtained under <a href=\"/doc/1687975/\" id=\"a_48\">Section\n\n167</a> of the CrPC, a person arrested cannot be detained for more than 24\n\nhours as stipulated under <a href=\"/doc/571025/\" id=\"a_49\">Section 57</a> of the CrPC. The time necessary for\n\nthe journey from the place of arrest to the Magistrate’s Court can however\n\nbe excluded, for computing the 24 hours permitted to the Police to keep an\n\naccused in their custody prior to a Magistrate’s authorization, as mandated\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1687975/\" id=\"a_50\">Section 167</a> CrPC.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_33\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_34\">22.   After the accused is arrested and police is unable to complete the\n\ninvestigation within the mandated 24 hours period, the police officer\n\nmaking the investigation is duty bound to transmit the accused to the\n\nMagistrate under <a href=\"/doc/1687975/\" id=\"a_51\">Section 167</a> of the CrPC. Sub-section (2) of Section 167\n\nthen sets out the action to be taken by the Magistrate to whom the accused\n\nperson is forwarded and the Magistrate may then authorize the detention of\n\nthe accused to further custody.   In terms of sub-section (2), the Magistrate\n\nmay authorize the detention of the accused in such custody as he thinks fit\n\nfor a term not exceeding 15 days in the whole but if he has no jurisdiction\n\nto try the case or commit it for trial and consider that the detention is\n\nunnecessary, on perusal of the entries in the diary, he may release the\n\naccused or forward him to the Magistrate having appropriate jurisdiction.\n\nThe sub-section is appended with a proviso which places an embargo on the\n\npower of the Magistrate and authorizes detention of the accused person\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">\f                                      12</span>\n\nbeyond the 15 days period, other than in the custody of the police, if he is of\n\nthe opinion that the circumstances so demand. But, the Magistrate shall\n\nnot authorize the detention of an accused person in custody for a total\n\nperiod exceeding 90 or 60 days in clause (i) or clause (ii) of proviso (a),\n\nrespectively. A right accrues to the accused if the investigation is not\n\ncompleted within the period prescribed in clause (i) or clause (ii) and on\n\nexpiry of the said period, the accused person shall be released on bail if he\n\nis prepared to and furnishes bail for his release.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_35\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_36\">23.   As can be seen from the above, the further detention beyond 24 hours\n\nof the accused is subject to authorization by the Magistrate and the power\n\nof the Magistrate to authorize detention of the accused either in police\n\ncustody or under magisterial custody is circumscribed by the period\n\nspecified in <a href=\"/doc/1687975/\" id=\"a_52\">Section 167</a> of the CrPC.      If the Magistrate is satisfied that\n\ncontinuing custody exceeding 15 days is warranted, he may authorize such\n\ndetention but in any case the authorized detention cannot exceed a period\n\nof 90 days or 60 days, as the case may be. On the expiry of the stipulated\n\nperiod specified in the proviso to <a href=\"/doc/839149/\" id=\"a_53\">Section 167 (2)</a> of the CrPC, if the\n\nprosecution fails to file the chargesheet/final report, the accused person\n\nhas an indefeasible right to be released on default bail.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_37\">24.   Section 167, as originally enacted in the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_54\">Code of Criminal Procedure</a>,\n\n1898 envisages completion of investigation within 24 hours. But, noticing\n\nthe difficulty in completing the investigation within the limited time,\n\nparticularly for complex crimes, the Law Commission of India recommended\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">\f                                          13</span>\n\nto increase the time limit for completion of investigation. On the basis of the\n\nrecommendation in the 41st Law Commission Report (September, 1969),\n\n<a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_55\">CrPC</a> was amended through the Act 45 of 1978. The Proviso (a) containing\n\nclauses (i) and (ii) were inserted to <a href=\"/doc/1687975/\" id=\"a_56\">Section 167</a> of the CrPC.          With such\n\ninclusion, while investigation is still expected to be completed with\n\npromptitude, it was additionally provided that only with a Magistrate’s\n\nauthorization, further detention is permitted, for the period specified in\n\nclauses (i) and (ii) under proviso (a).        A Magistrate authorizing detention\n\nmust however record his reasons for extending detention of an accused\n\nunder sub-section (3) of Section 167.          The purpose of the first proviso to\n\nSection 167(2) is to impress upon the police officers to expeditiously\n\ncomplete investigation within the prescribed period and prevent laxity. In\n\ndefault, the Magistrate shall release the accused on bail. This is subject to\n\nthe restriction imposed in Section 436-A, providing for the maximum period\n\nfor which, an under-trial prisoner may be detained. Chapter XXXVI provides\n\nfor limitation for taking cognizance in certain offences. Section 468 imposes\n\na bar on taking cognizance of an offence specified in sub-section (2) after\n\nthe   expiry   of   the   period   of   limitation.   Section   469   provides   for\n\ncommencement of period of limitation and it is to be noted that while\n\nsetting out the date on which the period of limitation would have started,\n\nsub-section (2) states that in computing the period of limitation, the day\n\nfrom which such period is to be computed, shall be excluded. Barring the\n\nsaid provision contained in Section 468 and Section 436A, there is no\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">\f                                         14</span>\n\nlimitation prescribed in completion of investigation and the investigation\n\nmay continue except for the default-bail right which accrues to the accused\n\non expiry of the 60th or 90th day, in terms of the first proviso to sub-section\n\n(2) of Section 167. Thus, the legislative intent providing for the 60/90 day\n\nstatutory period- serves a twin purpose, firstly speedy trial of the accused\n\nwhich would transform him into a convict or his release on culmination of\n\nthe trial and secondly, to assure speedy justice to the victim and to the\n\nsociety in general.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_38\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1615412\" id=\"span_44\">25.

Mr. Ram\n            Reddy sought to make a distinction of the earlier decisions by\n            contending that they ceased to have relevance because of the\n            amendment to proviso (a) making it an independent paragraph all\n            by itself. Since, we have held that in whichever way proviso (a) is\n            construed i.e. with reference to Section 167(2) or without\n            reference to it the periods of 90 days and 60 days prescribed by\n            the legislature can be reckoned only from the date of remand the\n            distinction sought to be made between the decisions rendered\n            prior to Amendment Act 45 of 1978 and subsequent to it does not\n            have much of significance.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">15    (1980) 1 SCC 108\n16    AIR 1979 P&amp;H 80\n17    1980 Crl.

However, noticing that some of the aforenoted decisions were prior to\n\nthe insertion of proviso (a) by the amending Act 45 of 1978, it was opined in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1615412/\" id=\"a_65\">Chaganti</a> (supra) that those earlier case laws have no relevance. The Court\n\nthen went on to state that the 90/60 days precribed in proviso (a) to Section\n\n167 (2) can be reckoned only from the date of remand and it is made clear\n\nthrough the amendment that the legislature had intended to provide a\n\n90/60 day remand period, for the purpose of investigation. It was also\n\nexpressly opined that the proviso (a) in reference to the total period of\n\ndetention can be interpreted on the plain language of the proviso itself,\n\nbeing a complete code on its own and it being wholly unnecessary to invoke\n\nprovisions of the <a href=\"/doc/905940/\" id=\"a_66\">General Clauses Act</a> or <a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_67\">Limitation Act</a>.</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_40\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"154033650\" id=\"span_52\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1615412\" id=\"span_53\">27.

The Court\n\nobserved that “the principle” would be attracted when a period is delimited\n\nby a Statute or Rule, which has both a beginning and an end; the word\n\n‘from’ indicates the beginning, i.e. the opening day which is to be excluded\n\nand, the last day is included by use of the word ‘to’. The requisite ‘from’ for\n\napplicability of <a href=\"/doc/1353686/\" id=\"a_110\">Section 9</a> is prescribed for a period ‘from’ and ‘to’, i.e. when\n\nthe period is marked by terminus quo and terminus ad quem. This principle\n\nbeing the underlying method for applicability of <a href=\"/doc/1353686/\" id=\"a_111\">Section 9</a> of the General\n\nClauses Act, 1897.    Significantly, in Section 167 application, there is no\n\nstarting or ending point for completion of the investigation. In the scheme\n\nof the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_112\">CrPC</a>, as has been elaborated above, the provisions contained in sub-\n\nsection (1) of Section 167 runs in continuation of sub-section (2). The\n\nproduction of the accused before the Magistrate is a sequel to his arrest by\n\nthe police and at the same time, the accused too has a right to be produced\n\nbefore the Magistrate, within 24 hours of his arrest. The day on which the\n\naccused is brought on remand before the Magistrate, sub-section (2) of\n\nSection 167 empowers the Magistrate to authorize the detention with the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_84\">\f                                      19</span>\n\npolice either by continuing it or remanding him to Magisterial custody.\n\nThere cannot be a pause/break between the two processes.              No de-\n\nlimitation is conceptualized in Section 167 nor can it be fitted into a period\n\nof limitation ‘from’ and ‘to’ since there is no limitation for completion of\n\ninvestigation and filing of the chargesheet. The production before the\n\nMagistrate is a process in continuation of arrest by the police and the\n\nMagistrate will authorize detention for not more than 15 days in the whole\n\nbut if he is satisfied that sufficient grounds exist, he may authorize an\n\naccused’s detention beyond 15 days otherwise than in the custody of police.\n\nPertinently, there is no fixed end point within which, the police or\n\ninvestigation authorities are required to complete the investigation.\n\nHowever, if the investigation is not completed and chargesheet is not filed\n\nwithin 60 or 90 days, a right of default bail accrues to the accused. The\n\nanterior period of custody with the police prior to the remand is not\n\ndetention. It is only so, pursuant to an authorization issued from the\n\nMagistrate. The period of detention by the Magistrate runs from the very\n\nday of remand order. Sub-section (2) of <a href=\"/doc/1687975/\" id=\"a_113\">Section 167</a> of the CrPC pertains to\n\nthe power of the Magistrate to remand an accused and there is no reason\n\nwhy the date of the Magesterial Court’s gaze on the accused, should be\n\nexcluded. In order to avoid long incarceration of an accused only because\n\nthe investigation is being carried out in a leisurely manner, the legislature\n\nwas prompted, to confer a right on the accused to be released on default\n\nbail if he is prepared to offer bail bond and the investigation may still\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_85\">\f                                            20</span>\n\ncontinue. This is why the <a href=\"/doc/905940/\" id=\"a_114\">General Clauses Act</a> cannot be made applicable to\n\nsub-section (2) of Section 167. Moreover, excluding the date of the remand\n\norder would also result in a break in the continuity of the custody of the\n\naccused which begins on his date of arrest under Section 56 and continues\n\ntill the stipulated 60/90 day period, under Section 167. Additionally, it is to\n\nbe noted that when we include the date of remand order as the first day of\n\nthe stipulated remand period- there arises no fixed 60-day period for which\n\nthe accused is remanded. Once the Magistrate authorises remand,\n\nirrespective of the time of the day, when he does so, the prosecution, in\n\neach case will have a varying period of custody which may range in a\n\nmoving cursor manner from a spectrum of 59 days and 23 hours or so to 59\n\ndays and 1 hour or so for offences covered under proviso a(ii) of Section\n\n167(2). The exact period of remand for an accused is subject to the first\n\ngaze of the Magesterial court and the signing of the remand order.</span></span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1615412\" id=\"span_86\">This\n\nexplains the finding in <a href=\"/doc/1615412/\" id=\"a_115\">Chaganti</a> (supra) that <a href=\"/doc/905940/\" id=\"a_116\">General Clauses Act</a> is\n\ninapplicable to <a href=\"/doc/1687975/\" id=\"a_117\">Section 167</a> CrPC, as there is no definite ‘from’ period from\n\nwhich the stipulated remand, may commence.

This we find to be\n\nfallacious as there is no fixed time period under which the investigation is to\n\nbe completed. As explained above, when we include the date of remand in\n\nthe stipulated 60/90 day period under Section 167, then it would result in\n\na varying remand period not exactly amounting to a neat 60/90 days time.\n\nThereby, making the <a href=\"/doc/905940/\" id=\"a_122\">General Clauses Act</a>, inapplicable.</span></span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_49\">36. <a href=\"/doc/571025/\" id=\"a_123\">Section 57</a> of the CrPC mandates that the accused be produced before\n\na Magistrate within 24 hours of arrest and under Section 167(2) the\n\nJudicial Magistrate is required to scrutinize the executive action and\n\ndetermine whether the rights of the accused are not subjugated by police\n\naction. The separation of the Executive and the Judicial exercise of power,\n\nultimately   protects   an   individual’s   personal   liberty   which   is   also\n\nconstitutionally protected under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_124\">Articles 21</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1371971/\" id=\"a_125\">22(2).</a>           If the date of\n\nremand ordered by a Magistrate is ignored, then an accused even though\n\nin custody, the same will not be counted within the 60/90 day period. The\n\ncustody on the date of remand is distinct from the arrest of an accused\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1670784/\" id=\"a_126\">Section 56</a> CrPC as that is considered as a period prior to\n\nproduction before the Magistrate. By this logic, even if the accused is\n\nunder custody it would neither be under Section 56, nor under 167(2) of\n\nthe <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_127\">CrPC</a>. This will lead to an apparent legal vacuum. This can however\n\nbe avoided if the remand period is considered from the very day of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_90\">\f                                      22</span>\n\nremand order.

Writing on ‘natural liberty’, William Blackstone in his commentaries\n\non Laws of England, in 1965 described those as absolute rights which were\n\nvested in the individual by the immutable laws of nature.

The right to personal liberty is directly related to the inalienable right\n\ntowards human dignity and personhood. The concept of dignity is central to\n\nour Constitutional law discourse. In fact, the Preamble itself, provides the\n\nguarantee of upholding ‘the dignity of the individual’. <a href=\"/doc/165099707/\" id=\"a_158\">The Constitution\n\n\n37      ADM Jabalpur vs. Shivkant Shukla</a> (1976) 2 SCC 521, (para 529) per HR Khanna J.\ndissenting\n38      <a href=\"/doc/91938676/\" id=\"a_159\">K.S.

The same proposition is also\n\nsupported by the scholar Hannah Arendt. According to Arendt, dignity\n\nconsists of the ‘right to have rights’ and the ‘right to equal political\n\nmembership       of   some     kind    of   organized      community’.40      Furthermore,\n\nconstitutional courts around the world have endorsed that the question of\n\nhuman dignity and equality form the base of personal liberty. 41 The US\n\nSupreme Court in Munn Vs. Illinois42, explained the term liberty in context of\n\nthe 14th Amendment to the US Constitution, and stated that, “by the term\n\n‘liberty’, as used in the provision, something more is meant than mere\n\nfreedom from physical restraint or the bounds of a prison. It means freedom\n\nto go where one may choose, and to act in such manner, not inconsistent with\n\nthe equal rights of others, ….. that is, to pursue such callings and avocations\n\nas may be most suitable to develop (individual) capacities and give to them\n\ntheir highest enjoyment.”43 These words were later adopted by this Court, in\n\nthe context of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_160\">Article 21</a> to suggest that life under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_161\">Article 21</a> does not mean,\n\nmere animal existence, but rather, a dignified existence.44\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_63\">48.

In such a situation a\n\nshort ten minute window or less, would be available for the police for\n\ncustodial investigation. On this it must be observed that production of an\n\naccused before a Magistrate say at 11:50 PM, has more to do with police\n\nproducing the accused within the prescribed 24 hour period as mandated\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/571025/\" id=\"a_165\">Section 57</a> CrPC. Therefore, the legal position vis-à-vis proviso (a) of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/839149/\" id=\"a_166\">Section 167 (2)</a> CrPC, cannot be resolved in favour of the investigation\n\nagencies, with such an extreme example. As stated earlier, when the day of\n\nremand order is included in the stipulated period under Section 167(2), the\n\nsame would encourage the prosecution to promptly comply with <a href=\"/doc/571025/\" id=\"a_167\">Section 57</a>\n\nCrPC. The leaning towards the accused’s right to personal liberty by\n\nreducing the 60 day period to something more than 59 days, and a few\n\nhours, is based on the constitutional protection afforded to an accused\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1371971/\" id=\"a_168\">Article 22(2)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_169\">Article 21.</a> In this way, the Code’s application in\n\ndealing with an accused would be consistent with the inviolable right of\n\npersonal liberty and dignity, as explained above.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_65\">49. Returning now to the English philosopher John Locke, with whose\n\nwords this judgment commenced,45 we have elected to answer this reference\n\nby endorsing that interpretation of law which advances the cause of justice\n\nand freedom.       The relevant provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_170\">CrPC</a> are the laws, that are\n\n45      Locke’s, in The Second Treatise of Government, argues that sovereignty resides in the\npeople and explains the nature of legitimate government in terms of natural rights and the\nsocial contract.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_116\">\f                                       30</span><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_66\">\n\nessential to protect an individual’s liberty. It regulates the societal need for\n\nlimited detention of persons charged with serious offences. We have\n\ntherefore adopted the interpretation whereby personal liberty is safeguarded\n\nand justice would not be compromised and in the grand scheme of things,\n\nthe unjustified detention of individuals is eschewed. As a court of law, once\n\nthe legal stipulations of the Code are satisfied, we are duty bound to apply\n\nthe law and prevent unlawful detention and protect personal liberty.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_67\">50. Since there exists vacuum in the application and details of <a href=\"/doc/1687975/\" id=\"a_171\">Section 167</a>\n\nCrPC, we have opted for an interpretation which advances the cause of\n\npersonal liberty. The accused herein were remanded on 14.05.2020 and as\n\nsuch, the chargesheet ought to have been filed on or before 12.07.2020 (i.e.\n\nthe sixtieth day). But the same was filed, only on 13.07.2020 which was the\n\n61st day of their custody. Therefore, the right to default bail accrued to the\n\naccused persons on 13.07.2020 at 12:00 AM, midnight, onwards. On that\n\nvery day, the accused filed their default bail applications at 8:53 AM. The\n\nED filed the chargesheet, later in the day, at 11:15 AM. Thus, the default\n\nbail Applications were filed well before the chargesheet. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"51738625\" id=\"span_117\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"10807134\" id=\"span_118\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"88760594\" id=\"span_119\">In <a href=\"/doc/88760594/\" id=\"a_172\">Ravindran</a>(supra)\n\nand <a href=\"/doc/10807134/\" id=\"a_173\">Bikramjit</a> (supra), which followed the Constitution Bench in <a href=\"/doc/51738625/\" id=\"a_174\">Sanjay\n\nDutt</a>(supra) it was rightly held that if the accused persons avail their\n\nindefeasible right to default bail before the chargesheet/final report is filed,\n\nthen such right would not stand frustrated or extinguished by any such\n\nsubsequent filing. We therefore declare that the stipulated 60/90 day\n\nremand period under <a href=\"/doc/1687975/\" id=\"a_175\">Section 167</a> CrPC ought to be computed from the date\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_120\">\f                                       31</span>\n\nwhen a Magistrate authorizes remand. If the first day of remand is\n\nexcluded, the remand period, as we notice will extend beyond the permitted\n\n60/90 days’ period resulting in unauthorized detention beyond the period\n\nenvisaged under <a href=\"/doc/1687975/\" id=\"a_176\">Section 167</a> CrPC. In cases where the chargesheet/final\n\nreport is filed on or after the 61 st/91st day, the accused in our considered\n\nopinion would be entitled to default bail. In other words, the very moment\n\nthe stipulated 60/90 day remand period expires, an indefeasible right to\n\ndefault bail accrues to the accused.</span></span></span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_68\">51.
