It is also stated that the\n\n                      experience of the government has been that even after giving a bond, the\n\n                      students chose to defy the bond and take up jobs elsewhere.

Under these\n                              circumstances, the condition cannot be said to be violative of\n                              <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_6\">Articles 14</a> <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_7\">&amp; 21</a> of the Constitution of India. It also cannot be said\n                              that the condition is violative of Part-III of the Constitution, as it\n                              does not restrict admission only to such of those persons, who are\n                              economically affluent. Not only the State is incurring expenditures\n                              in imparting education, but is also making payment to them in one\n                              form or the other. That apart, the Bank Guarantee is required to be\n                              furnished in phases and not in one go. Rs. 3,00,000/- per annum is\n                              not a huge amount, which a specialist cannot afford to arrange for\n                              and that too for the purpose of Bank Guarantee.

In\n                              our considered view, it does not cast any unnecessary burden upon\n                              the students belonging to economically backward families.

According to\n                              them, the State Governments have understood the decision of this\n                              Court in Harsh Pratap Sisodia (1999 (2) SCC 575) to be a restraint\n                              on the exercise of their power in matters relating to eligibility\n                              criteria   for   admission   to   medical   course.

Reasonableness\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_49\">                                     19. Reasonableness is a ground that pervades through the\n                              submissions made by the counsel on both sides. In the State of\n                              West Bengal, the requirement of a compulsory bond was initially a\n                              service of one year in the State in default of Rs.10 Lakhs was to be\n                              paid. This was enhanced to three years and Rs.30 Lakhs by a\n                              Notification dated 09.10.2014. In the State of Tamil Nadu, the\n                              bond condition was that a doctor has to serve for ten years in the\n                              State and in default of which, the doctor was to pay Rs.2 Crores.\n                              This was reduced to two years and Rs.50 Lakhs. The Armed Forces\n                              Medical College imposes a condition of five years compulsory\n                              service in the Army for post-graduate and super Speciality doctors\n                              who prosecuted their study in the college. They have an option of\n                              not serving for five years by recompensing the Government by\n                              paying Rs.25 Lakhs. The main contention of the counsel appearing\n                              for the Appellants is that the condition of a long period of service\n                              that is imposed is unreasonable. The basis for the submission is\n                              that they have already served the society by working in\n                              Government hospitals while undergoing their course. Further\n                              conditions imposed on them would impede the progress of their\n                              careers. Restrictions placed on their choice of place of work are\n                              also unreasonable according to them. An alternate submission\n                              made by the counsel appearing for the Appellants is that the\n                              imposition of the condition of compulsory bond should be\n                              reasonable and the exit clause should be relaxed.

Truly speaking, this is directed towards\n                              the deprived, downtrodden and the have-nots. He further held\n                              that the humanistic concept of human dignity which is to be\n                              accorded to that particular segment of the society has to be kept\n                              in mind. Their human dignity is based on the socio-economic rights\n                              that are read into the fundamental rights. The importance of the\n                              communitarian approach along with the individualistic approach\n                              to human dignity was addressed by Dr. A.K. Sikri, J. in the above\n                              judgment.

We accept the submission of Mr. Rakesh Dwivedi,\n                              learned Senior Counsel for the State of West Bengal that the\n                              positive obligation of the State to uphold the dignity of a larger\n                              section of the society is to protect the rights conferred on them\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">                      22/36</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">\f                                                                                            WP.No.14112 of 2019</span>\n\n\n\n\n                              by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_30\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. The immediate need of the\n                              deprived sections of the society to have proper health care was\n                              the reason behind the policy decision of the Government. The\n                              objective of the policy is to ensure that specialist health care is\n                              extended to the have-nots also.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_67\">                                     31. The next question that arises is whether there is a\n                              conflict between the rights of the community and the rights of the\n                              Appellants. As stated earlier, the right that is claimed by the\n                              Appellants is to make an individual choice to carry on their\n                              profession which might be hindered by the decision of the\n                              Government. On the other hand, the basic idea behind the\n                              Government’s decision is larger public interest. The judgment of\n                              this Court in Sayyed Ratanbhai Sayeed ((2016) 4 SCC 631) relied\n                              upon by the High Court is to the effect that private interest has to\n                              take a back seat when pitted against public interest. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"382721\" id=\"span_50\">In <a href=\"/doc/382721/\" id=\"a_31\">Mr. X v.\n                              Hospital ‘Z’</a>, ((1998) 8 SCC 296) Saghir Ahmad J speaking for this\n                              Court, held that:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">                                          &quot;44….Moreover, where there is a clash of two\n                                  Fundamental Rights, as in the instant case, namely, the\n                                  appellant&#x27;s right to privacy as part of right to life and Ms ‘Y’s\n                                  right to lead a healthy life which is her Fundamental Right\n                                  under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_32\">Article 21</a>, the right which would advance the public\n                                  morality or public interest, would alone be enforced through\n                                  the process of court, for the reason that moral considerations\n                                  cannot be kept at bay and the Judges are not expected to sit\n                                  as mute structures of clay in the hall known as the courtroom,\n                                  but have to be sensitive, “in the sense that they must keep\n                                  their fingers firmly upon the pulse of the accepted morality of\n                                  the day”.[emphasis supplied].\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_68\">                                     32.

The above discussion leads us to the conclusion that\n                              right to life guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_33\">Article 21</a> means right to life with\n                              human dignity. Communitarian dignity has been recognised by this\n                              Court. While balancing communitarian dignity vis-à-vis the dignity\n                              of private individuals, the scales must tilt in favour of\n                              communitarian dignity. The laudable objective with which the\n                              State Governments have introduced compulsory service bonds is to\n                              protect the fundamental right of the deprived sections of the\n                              society guaranteed to them under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_34\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of\n                              India.
