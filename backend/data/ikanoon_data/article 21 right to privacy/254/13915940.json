Mr.G.Anand, learned counsel appearing for the appellant, raising\n\n                      the basic issue that no writ under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_2\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India\n\n                      shall be issued against the private men or private body, argued that when the\n\n                      appellant is a private factory situated in Velacherry at Chennai and also in\n\n                      Thane, Mumbai and Roha. Maharashtra, all the factories of the appellant are\n\n                      manufacturing pharmaceutical and nutraceutical products for the past 80\n\n                      years. Since various state-of-the-art technologies are being installed from\n\n                      time to time to make the products affordable to the common men and\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                      2/15</span>\n\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">\f                                                                                      W.A.No.576 of 2015</span>\n\n                      customers, for harnessing the human resources, it has been paying a fairly\n\n                      very high wage to its workmen, at the same time, it wanted to ensure that the\n\n                      working time of the available manpower during shift hours are properly\n\n                      availed with optimum use. Secondly, when there were frequent complaints\n\n                      of theft made by the workmen from the lockers room provided by the\n\n                      appellant to them to make sure that the workmen are not taking lame\n\n                      excuses to sleep in the rest room and also to avoid any theft of workmen&#x27;s\n\n                      belongings from the lockers room, the appellant management has installed\n\n                      the CCTVs all over the factories including the lockers room, as the factory\n\n                      buildings are spread in a vast area and there is also very large open space\n\n                      available within the factory. Besides, the rest room and toilet facilities are\n\n                      provided in a building away from the production area. In addition thereto,\n\n                      there are separate rest rooms for men and women workers and the rest\n\n                      rooms are fitted with lockers to change over to uniform and keep their\n\n                      belongings safely. If all the workmen come forward to report for duty\n\n                      wearing their full uniforms, then the need for changing the dress could be\n\n                      eliminated. Inside the rest room, urinals are also provided in separate closed\n\n                      enclosures with no visibility of the persons while using the toilet and the rest\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                      3/15</span>\n\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">\f                                                                                    W.A.No.576 of 2015</span>\n\n                      rooms are also fitted with fans.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_5\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_6\">                             3. Further, when the appellant faced several instances from both\n\n                      Mumbai and Chennai factories that the workmen were frequently slipping\n\n                      away from the place of work in the guise of going to toilet and spending the\n\n                      duty time for which they are paid wages, it became impossible to monitor\n\n                      the movement of all the personnel during the entire shift operations. As the\n\n                      factory area in Chennai covered an area of 100 grounds, it therefore became\n\n                      imperative that the movement of employed manpower during shift hours is\n\n                      kept under vigil, so that it will act as a deterrent for anyone to sneak away\n\n                      from working hours more than the time required for answering the calls of\n\n                      nature. Since the rest room is meant for the workmen to keep their\n\n                      belongings in the lockers and for changing their home dress to the factory\n\n                      uniform, in the year 2009, in Thane factory at Mumbai, CCTVs were\n\n                      installed in 28 locations including 6 rest rooms. There was no resistance or\n\n                      demur on the part of the workmen. Although these workmen are members of\n\n                      a powerful trade union like the first respondent herein, there was no\n\n                      objection for installing the CCTVs in all the places other than the toilet\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                      4/15</span>\n\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">\f                                                                                      W.A.No.576 of 2015</span>\n\n                      room. Even before installing the CCTVs in Thane factory at Mumbai, a\n\n                      study was made in the areas where there was movement of men and only\n\n                      thereafter, CCTVs were installed in Thane factory in the year 2009 and\n\n                      subsequently in 12 areas in the Chennai factory, CCTVs were installed in\n\n                      the year 2012.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_7\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_8\">                             4. However, objecting to the installation of CCTVs in various places\n\n                      inside the private factory owned by the appellant, without even knowing the\n\n                      fundamental and rudimentary legal position, the writ petition has been filed\n\n                      seeking a mandamus against the private factory to remove the CCTVs from\n\n                      the rest room of male workers citing that it violated the right to privacy,\n\n                      decency and also violated <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_3\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India.\n\n                      Mr.G.Anand, learned counsel further submitted that the writ petition against\n\n                      the private factory, first of all, is not legally maintainable under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_4\">Article 226</a>\n\n                      of the Constitution of India. This crucial settled legal position has been\n\n                      overlooked by the learned single Judge. Secondly, when the CCTVs were\n\n                      installed in the factory of the appellant after identifying 38 areas including 2\n\n                      rest rooms where movement of men required vigil, barring the toilet rooms of\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                      5/15</span>\n\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">\f                                                                                     W.A.No.576 of 2015</span>\n\n                      men and women, and the movement of even officers, managers, supervisory\n\n                      staff were also subject to vigil of CCTVs to regulate their movement and\n\n                      keep them under watch to deter them needlessly being away from their work\n\n                      place, the first respondent union, raising objection to the installation of\n\n                      CCTVs, took up the matter to the second respondent before whom the\n\n                      appellant appeared and explained that the grievance of the first respondent\n\n                      was wholly unjustified. As the role of the Conciliation Officer is to mediate\n\n                      and bring about a settlement and if no settlement is arrived at, to submit his\n\n                      failure report, based on which it is for the Government to decide whether the\n\n                      reference for adjudication should be made or not, without appreciating the\n\n                      reasons that it is not within the province of the Conciliation Officer to give\n\n                      directions, the second respondent issued a letter dated 29.10.2013 directing\n\n                      the appellant not to activate the CCTVs contrary to the existing and\n\n                      prevailing customs in the State of Tamil Nadu. As there is no question of\n\n                      violation of <a href=\"/doc/1774629/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 33</a> of the Industrial Disputes Act, the writ petition has\n\n                      been filed under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_6\">Article 226</a> seeking a mandamus against the private factory\n\n                      restraining them from operating the CCTVs and to remove them from the\n\n                      rest room of the male workers, as it is contrary to the direction of the second\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                      6/15</span>\n\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">\f                                                                                     W.A.No.576 of 2015</span>\n\n                      respondent, on the premise that the action of the appellant affects the dignity\n\n                      and self-respect of the workmen working in the factory. Mr.G.Anand, after\n\n                      some arguments, raising heavy objection on the maintainability of the writ\n\n                      petition against the private factory, submitted that the appellant will not\n\n                      install any CCTVs inside the rest room and they will install the CCTVs only\n\n                      in the lockers room and other sensitive places where the workmen are\n\n                      unnecessarily sleeping away from the work spot and wasting the valuable\n\n                      duty hours. Besides, in the lockers room, frequent theft complaints are\n\n                      being filed, so if the CCTVs are installed, it will only help them avoiding the\n\n                      theft of their valuables. To this effect, he has also filed an affidavit dated\n\n                      30.6.2021.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_9\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_10\">                             5. Per contra, Mr.N.G.R.Prasad, learned counsel appearing for the\n\n                      first respondent/writ petitioner contended that the appellant, on an earlier\n\n                      occasion, prevented the workmen from getting rest during rest hours. As per\n\n                      long standing practice, the management provided 5 relievers who work side\n\n                      by side with regular workers in the shift. The said 5 relievers look after the\n\n                      production when the other relieved workers go to relieve themselves for 15\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                      7/15</span>\n\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">\f                                                                                     W.A.No.576 of 2015</span>\n\n                      minutes during the reliever break. Between 11.00 AM and 11.15 AM and\n\n                      from 4.00 PM to 4.15 PM, all the workmen will go to the rest room after\n\n                      stopping the machines. This was the customary practice prevailing in the\n\n                      appellant&#x27;s management all along. But the appellant took exception to these\n\n                      5 workers relieving and other workers going and relaxing for 15 minutes. In\n\n                      fact they wanted the workmen to work in the 15 minutes without\n\n                      interruption to augment production. Therefore, they asked the security staff\n\n                      not to allow the workers to go out of the factory gate during lunch time.
