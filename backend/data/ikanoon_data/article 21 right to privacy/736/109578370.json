The said statement was written and prepare\nby the ACIT, Circle 18(1) and our partner was not allowed to read the\ncontents of the same and was forced to sign the same under the\ncircumstances as mentioned in our letter dated 29/09/2008.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">Thus, we state that the said statement has not been given voluntarily\nand therefore the statement may be treated as retracted as the\ndisclosure of additional income of Rs.1,20,00,000/- was taken through\nintimidation and threats given during the survey.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">As we have already requested not to deposit the four post dated cheque\nof Rs. 10,00,000/- each taken forcibly from us, we may state that there\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                            6</span>\n                                                      I.T.A. No. 820/Mum/2015\n\n\nwas no concealed income, which was found during the course of survey\nand once again request not to deposit the cheque.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">32. It is clear from the above retraction letter filed before the AO that the\nappellant has leveled not only the serious allegation of threat and\ncoercion but also another serious allegation, that the statement was\nwritten and prepared by the ACIT Circle 18(1) and the partner of the\nfirm was not allowed to read the contents of the same and was forced,\nto sign the statement. The AO should have taken such allegations\nleveled seriously and cross examined the appellant for the allegations\nleveled. Once the retraction statement was made by the appellant\nalleging the threat and coercion along with the allegation of forcefully\ngetting the statement signed from the partner of the firm, the AO was to\nexamine the contents of the retraction statement and should have\nafforded an opportunity to the partner of the firm to explain the\ncircumstances which led to the retraction of the additional income and\nprove that the contents of the retractions letter were correct. The A.O did\nnot cross examine the appellant on the issue of retraction of statement\nand thus denying the appellant the opportunity to explain the reasons\nleading to the retraction of the statement.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">33.     It is also now accepted legal proposition that the Confession\nmade by the assessee in the statement recorded during the proceedings<a href=\"/doc/129721/\" id=\"a_20\">\nu/s 133A</a> are not conclusive evidence and it is open to the assessee to\nestablish that the contents of the statement recorded during the survey\nwere not true and correct by filing cogent evidence, which in the instant\ncase was the letter filed by the appellant before the ACIT 18(1), Mumbai\ndated 16/10/2008. Specific provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_21\">Income-tax Act</a> as\ncontained under <a href=\"/doc/1006941/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 132(4)</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1792382/\" id=\"a_23\">133A(5)</a>, etc., provide that statements\nrecorded in the income-tax proceedings under the above sections have\nevidentiary value.

Perusal of the paper placed at page 175 of the impounded material\nshows that it is a plain paper, showing some words not even figures,\nwithout any corroborative evidence to show that the, words written on it\nrepresent the money received in cash by the appellant. The contention\nof the AO is that the appellant had admitted in the statement recorded\nduring the survey that this document represent cash money received\nfrom various parties which has not been accounted for in the books of\naccounts. There is no further evidence regarding the names and\naddresses of the parties who have paid such amounts in cash and\nwhat is the nature of these transactions and further as to whether\nthese are business transactions or some other transactions. During the\nassessment proceedings, the AO simply relied on this statement and\nmade an addition of Rs.62,00,000/-, on account of cash receipts\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                             8</span>\n                                                   I.T.A. No. 820/Mum/2015\n\n\ndespite knowing fully well that statement recorded during the survey\nhas already been retracted in the post survey proceedings. Since the\nstatement was already retracted by the appellant the AO, should have\nmade further independent investigations to prove that the appellant had\nreceived the above cash payments. But no efforts were made in this\ndirection and the AO proceeded to make the additions on the basis of\nthe admission of additional income in the statement recorded during the\ncourse of survey<a href=\"/doc/129721/\" id=\"a_31\"> u/s 133A</a>.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_24\">41 The addition made merely on the basis of statement recorded during\nthe course, of survey, without any further corroborative evidence,\ncannot be held to be justified. The additions cannot further be sustained\nin view of the allegation that the disclosure of additional income under\nthe various heads was taken forcefully and the partner of the firm Shri.\nInderjit Singh Khokhar was forced to sign the statement without\ndisclosing its content to him. Such categorical assertion made by the\nappellant appears to be correct looking into the fact that the appellant\nhad brought the facts of the survey proceedings and incidents of their\nharassment to the knowledge of the higher authorities of the\ndepartment including Central Board of Directs Taxes and had also filed\nthe writ petition before the High Court of Bombay narrating the events\nand, irregularities committed by the authorized officer during the course\nof survey. The AO has not rebutted the above arguments of the\nappellant in the assessment order, though the AO was made aware of\nthese incidents during the course of assessment proceedings and\nproceeded to complete the assessment stating that the statement\nrecorded and the additional income admitted during the course of\nsurvey proceedings was voluntary.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_25\">42.     As outlined above, the various courts have held that the\nstatement recoded during the survey<a href=\"/doc/129721/\" id=\"a_32\"> u/s 133A</a> does not have any\nevidentiary value, as the proceedings<a href=\"/doc/129721/\" id=\"a_33\"> u/s 133A</a> does not authorize the\nofficer to take a sworn-in statement. Rather the tax payers are not\nrequired to make a statement admitting or denying any concealment of\nincome during the course of survey statement recorded during the\nsurvey, if any, cannot be the only basis of making any addition to the\nincome of the assessee unless and until the statement is supported by\ncorroborative evidence. This has been made clear by the CBDT\ninstruction F. No. 286/2/2003-IT(lnv) dated 10.3.2003 has &quot;.......\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_26\">Instances have come to the notice of the Board where assessees have\nclaimed that they have been forced to confess the undisclosed income\nduring the course of the search and seizure and survey operations.\nSuch confessions, if not based upon credible evidence, are later\nretracted by the concerned assessees while filing returns of income. In\nthese circumstances, on confessions during the course of search and\nseizure and survey operations do not serve any useful purpose. It is,\ntherefore, advised that there should be focus and concentration on\ncollection of evidence of income which leads to information on what has\nnot been disclosed or is not likely to be disclosed before the IT\nDepartment. Similarly, while recording statement during the course of\nsearch and seizure and survey operations no attempt should be made\nto obtain confession as to the undisclosed income. Any action on the\ncontrary shall be viewed adversely.\n</p>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                             9</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_27\">                                                   I.T.A.

In view of the above CBDT instructions also, it would not be open\nfor an assessing officer to make an assessment merely on the\nadmission of additional income made in the statement recorded during\nthe survey<a href=\"/doc/129721/\" id=\"a_34\"> u/s 133A</a> It has been made amply clear in the above\ninstructions that an Assessing Officer should rely solely upon the\nevidences and materials gathered during the survey for making\nadditions and framing the assessment orders and the statements or\nconfession taken during the survey do not serve any useful purpose.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_29\">44, In view of the facts and&#x27; circumstances explained above, in my\nconsidered opinion, there is no justification for making addition of Rs.\n62,00,000/- to the income of the appellant on account of cash receipts\nas there is no credible evidences placed on record to prove the same. As\nfar as the paper placed at page 175 of the impounded material is\nconcerned, it is a plain paper or a dumb document, showing some\nwords not even figures written on it, without any corroborative\nevidence to show that these represent the money received in cash by\nthe appellant. There is no further evidence regarding the names and\naddresses of the parties who have paid such amounts in cash and\nwhat is the nature of these transactions. In the absence of any such\ncorroborative evidence placed on record by the AO, the addition made\namounting to Rs. 62,00,000/- cannot be sustained and hence deleted.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_30\">45.

It is clear from the above answers to the questions that the above\nadditions have been made by the AO solely based on the statement\nrecorded during the course of survey proceedings<a href=\"/doc/129721/\" id=\"a_35\"> u/s 133A</a>. There is no\nmention of any documentary evidence or any impounded documents in\nthe above statement which could, have led the, AO to conclude that the\nabove income had not been disclosed by the appellant for the period\nunder consideration. The AO has neither placed any evidence on record\nnor has referred to any impounded material in the assessment order\nbefore making the above additions to the income of the appellant for the\nperiod under consideration, The AO has not even discussed the\ndifferent heads under which the additions are made in the, assessment\norder. What are the unaccounted purchases of Rs. 20,00,000/- and\nhow this figure has been arrived at, has not been discussed by the AO\nin the assessment order. There is no corroborative evidence to prove the\nunaccounted nature of the above income, which has been added to the\ntotal income of the appellant for the year under consideration. Similarly\nin respect of the other additions made under the heads unaccounted\npurchases, labour charges, site expenses, salary &amp; wages and capital\nintroduction by the partners in the capital account etc, there is no\ncorroborative evidence to prove the unaccounted nature of these\nexpenses. All these additions made by the AO are purely on the basis of\nstatement recorded during the course of survey on the basis of the\nquestions and answers at sr. no. 16, 17 and 18 of the statement\nrecorded without any supporting evidences. The AO has not even\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                             11</span>\n                                                   I.T.A.

Such an action of the AO cannot be justified.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_34\">48,     As stated above, various courts including the Apex Court have\ntaken a consistent view that the confessional statement made by any\nperson during the course of survey<a href=\"/doc/129721/\" id=\"a_36\"> u/s 133A</a> are not conclusive\nevidence and does not have any evidentiary value. &quot; No addition to the\nincome on the basis of disclosure could be made where assessee had\nretracted certain income after disclosing it and no material had been\nfound to prove this income during the survey&quot;[Ashok Manilal Thakkar\nvs ACIT 279 ITR 143 (ITAT-AHM). Merely the statement cannot be made\nthe basis for making additions to the income of the assessee while\ncompleting&#x27; the assessment proceedings. This issue has already been\ndiscussed in detail in the preceding paras above.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_35\">49, In view of the facts and circumstances explained above, in my\nconsidered opinion, there is no justification for making addition of Rs.\n58,00,000/- to the income of the appellant on account of unaccounted\npurchases, labour charges, site expenses, salary, &amp; wages,\noctroi/transportation, conveyance and capital introduction by the\npartners, as there is no credible evidence, placed on record to prove the\nappellant had incurred the above expenses and not recorded in the\nbooks of accounts, These additions have been made purely on the\nbasis of statement recorded during the course of survey<a href=\"/doc/129721/\" id=\"a_37\"> u/s 133A</a>\nwhich was later on retracted. In the absence of any other corroborative\nevidence placed on record by the AO to support the additions made,\nsuch addition made cannot be sustained and hence additions made\namounting to Rs. 58,00,000/- is hereby deleted.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_36\">50.    Regarding the instances of additions made in the case of the\nappellant for the AY 2007-08 and 2008-09 quoted by the AO in the\nassessment order , there is no relevance of quoting these instances for\nthe year under consideration as every assessment year is separate\nassessment year and the principle of res judicata does not apply to the\nincome tax proceedings. The additions made in those years will have no\nmaterial effect on the proceedings for the year under consideration as\nthe issues in both the years are different. Moreover, it has been\ninformed by the AR of the appellant that the additions made for the AY.\n2007-08 and 2008-09 have all been deleted by the appellate authorities\nsubsequently, Therefore quoting the instances of additions made in the\ncase of the appellant in the AY. 2007-08 and 2008-09 by the AO is an\nexercise in futile.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_37\">51.     At para 5.4 the AO has made the observation that at page 5 of\nthe impounded material is the account of Deccan Lime Depot, wherein a\nbill amounting to. Rs. 88,004/- dated 09/09/2008 was not accounted\nfor in the final accounts. From this the AO conclude that the account of\nthe appellant are defective. Similarly, at the page 12 of the impounded\nmaterial, the AO pointed that there is an account of Pyramid Ply\nVeneers and Laminates and a bill amounting to Rs, 27,000/- dated\n26/05/2000 was not accounted for in the final accounts.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_38\">52.    Again at para 5.6 , the AO has pointed out discrepancies in\nrespect of the account of M/s. Weather Cool Sales. The AO observed\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                            12</span>\n                                                        I.T.A.

During the assessment proceedings\n      also, the same explanation was given to the AO which was accepted by\n      him. Such explanation is placed at page 139 to 152 of the paper book\n      filed during the appellate proceedings.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_40\">      54. The above contention of the AR of the appellant is correct. The\n      appellant had filed the explanations regarding the impounded material\n      which included the explanation in respect of the page 5 and page 11\n      (wrongly written as 12 by the AO) referred in the assessment order, The\n      explanation offered by the appellant were accepted by the AO and no\n      addition was made by the AO for non-accounting the bills of Rs.\n      88,004/- and Rs, 27,000/-. Such an action of the AO is not correct. One\n      the above discrepancy was noted and it was found that the above bills\n      have not been accounted for and the expenditure has been incurred, the\n      same should have been added back to the income of the assessee. the\n      only explanation offered by the appellant is that these bills were not\n      accounted for due to oversight. Such an explanation cannot be\n      accepted. The AO is directed to add back the above amounts of\n      Rs.88,004/- and Rs 27,000/- as unaccounted expenditure<a href=\"/doc/851964/\" id=\"a_38\"> u/s. 69C</a> of\n      the I.T Act 1961.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_41\">      55.     Regarding the other discrepancy of two bills of M/s Weather\n      Cool Sales, of Rs. 61,03,450/- and Rs. 21,19,636/- were recorded in\n      the final accounts as Rs. 60,40,584/- and Rs. 20,97,804/- respectively,\n      the AR of the appellant has contended that this difference in the\n      amounts is on account of Tax Deducted at Source. The AR of the\n      appellant has also filed the copy of the Ledger account of the above\n      party (placed at annexure S of the paper book) wherein it is clear that\n      though the amount of the bill is Rs. 61,03,450/- after deducting TDS of\n      Rs. 62,866/-, the net amount credited to the account of the above party\n      is Rs. 60,40,584/-. Similar is the case in respect of the amount of Rs.\n      21,19,636/-, out of which TDS of Rs. 21,832/- has been deducted and\n      net amount credited to the account of the above party is Rs.\n      20,97,804/-.

It has been explained by the assessee in the said\nnotice of the advocates in nutshell that survey team maltreated partners of\nthe assessee and their    father with an objective to force them to prepare\nloose document marked page no. 175 of the impounded documents during\nthe course of survey proceedings itself to admit and surrender an income of\nRs. 62 lacs as concealed income which is placed at paper book page no. 155\nplaced before the tribunal . It is also alleged by the assessee that fictitious\nentries were also introduced in the tally software        in the computer of the\nassessee wherein books of accounts were maintained of the assessee at the\nbehest   of   the   survey   team        wherein   books       of     accounts    were\nmanipulated/tampered      with   and      the   partner   of    the    assessee   was\ncoerced/threatened by survey team to give forced statement to voluntarily\ndisclose an concealed income of Rs. 58 lacs based on such tampering of\nbooks of accounts .

It is\nalso been explained that there was no discrepancy in the books of accounts\nalthough some of the bills were not entered in the books of accounts when\nsurvey took place and so far as discrepancies in the books of accounts and\nbills are concerned , same were explained to be on account of differential due\nto VAT/TDS. The assessee has also explained that preceding years additions\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                                    17</span>\n                                                          I.T.A.

In the said writ petition, allegations of very serious\nnature are made by the assessee against survey party and the manner in\nwhich survey operations were conducted and it is claimed that assessee was\nthreatened and coerced to give forced statement and to surrender income of\nRs. 1.20 crore as well to prepare documents reflecting concealed income to\nthe tune of Rs. 62 lacs vide impounded page no 175 which is placed at paper\nbook 155 .

The aforesaid\nrelied upon document marked at page 175 , in our considered view is a\ndumb document and is not sufficient to fasten tax liability unless the same\nis corroborated by further incriminating material/evidences on record which\nin the instant case is lacking. It was also explained by the assessee that tally\nsoftware containing account books was tempered/manipualted in the night\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">                                   18</span>\n                                                          I.T.A. No. 820/Mum/2015\n\n\nof 19/20-09-2008 to introduced fictitious entries to justify surrender of\nincome to the tune of Rs. 58 lacs. The assessee has also brought report from\nsoftware / technical experts to substantiate tampering in tally software in\nthe night of 19/20-09-2008 which has remain un-rebutted by Revenue even\nbefore us . The Revenue has not chosen to send the said computer system\n/hard disk for forensic examination by experts to counter aforesaid serious\nallegations levied by the assessee nor any report of technical expert was\ncalled by Revenue to counter allegations of the assessee. These documents\nwere also placed by the assessee before Hon‟ble Bombay High Court in the\nwrit petition filed with Hon‟ble Bombay High Court. The dismissal of the said\nwrit petition   no. 2831 of 2008 vide orders dated 06.01.2009 permitting\nwithdrawal of the writ petition by Hon‟ble Bombay High Court is placed in\npaper book at page no. 106 , wherein Hon‟ble Bombay High court permitted\nassessee to raise all grievances relating to entries in books of accounts before\nthe authorities during the course of assessment proceedings. CBDT vide\nletter dated 03-11-2008 has also written letter to the assessee assuring\nsuitable action to resolve grievance of the assessee which is        placed on\nrecord in paper book. The assessee filed its return of income on 30-09-2009\nwherein the said surrendered income of Rs. 1.2 crore was not declared as\nincome in the return of income filed with revenue consequent to the survey<a href=\"/doc/129721/\" id=\"a_52\">\nu/s. 133A</a>. Thus , in nutshell the assessee made the retraction of the said\nsurrendered income of Rs. 1.20 crore vide letters dated 29.09.2008,\n16.10.2008 , filing of   writ petition with Hon‟ble Bombay High Court and\nseveral other communications with the tax-authorities including CBDT\nwhich are placed in record in paper book filed with the Revenue. It is also\npertinent to mention that Revenue chose not to cross examine assessee‟s\npartner Mr Inderjit Singh Khokhar pursuant to retraction of the voluntarily\ndisclosure of Rs. 1.2 crores made by the assessee . The Revenue has also\nchosen not to place on record       report of vigilance and other enquiries\ninitiated by it as directed by CBDT. Now under these circumstances , we\nhave to see whether there is sufficient incriminating material on record to\njustify additions as were made by the AO . The statement of the partner of\nthe assessee Mr Inderjit Singh Khokar recorded on 19-09-2008 stood\nretracted by the assessee within 10 days from the date of survey as detailed\nabove . CBDT vide its instruction F.No.286/2/2003-IT(Inv) dated 10-03-\n2003 had directed its officers to focus on collection of incriminating material\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">                                   19</span>\n                                                        I.T.A.

In\n      these circumstances, on confessions during the course of search and\n      seizure and survey operations do not serve any useful purpose. It is,\n      therefore, advised that there should be focus and concentration on\n      collection of evidence of income which leads to information on what has\n      not been disclosed or is not likely to be disclosed before the IT\n      Department. Similarly, while recording statement during the course of\n      search and seizure and survey operations no attempt should be made\n      to obtain confession as to the undisclosed income. Any action on the\n      contrary shall be viewed adversely.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">      Further, in respect of pending assessment proceedings also, AOs should\n      rely upon the evidences/materials gathered during the&#x27; course of\n      search/survey operations or thereafter while framing the relevant\n      assessment orders.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_47\">We have observed that the A.O has referred to minor discrepancies in the\nbooks of accounts and the bills which has not been entered in the books of\naccounts which has been suitably explained by the assessee that these\nminor variations were on account of VAT/TDS differentials which stood\nreconciled by the assessee as also it is explained that merely because one\nbill is not entered in the books of accounts on the day of survey is not\nsufficient to reject books of accounts and come to adverse conclusions.\nThese minor discrepancies in the absence of other tangible incriminating\nmaterial against the assessee in our considered view does not warrant any\naddition as was made by the A.O. . The AO has referred to additions being\nmade in the preceding years which the assessee has explained to be deleted\nby appellate authorities which has also remained un-rebutted by Revenue\neven before us and in any case merely because additions on some grounds in\npreceding years have been made does not warrant that the books of\naccounts have become unreliable for even the subsequent             years as\nprinciples of res judicata are not applicable to income-tax proceedings as\nadditions in every year is to be made on its own merits. There were additions\nmade to the tune of Rs. 58 lacs on account of alleged discrepancies in the\nbooks apart from as is reflected in loose page 175 to the tune of Rs. 62 lacs\nas under :\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">                                  20</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">                                                                       I.T.A.

It is always open for                 the assessee to rebut the same by\nbringing     on     record      necessary       corroboratory         evidences     including\ncircumstantial evidences to aver that the statements obtained during survey\nis vitiated by threat , coercion, fraud or force and is in-voluntary in nature\nwhich cannot be acted upon to fasten tax-liability . Then it become\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                                         21</span>\n                                                          I.T.A. No. 820/Mum/2015\n\n\nincumbents on the Courts to see whether the said retracted statement\ninspire confidence to fasten tax liability or is vitiated by coercion, threat ,\nforce or fraud which will make it not reliable enough to fasten tax liability on\nthe tax-payer being involuntary in nature . The assessee in the instant case\nhas consistently raised serious allegation against survey team at various\nforums of the tax authorities including CBDT, Hon‟ble Bombay High Court\nas well before us as to the statement being obtained by threat, force and\ncoercion but Revenue has chosen not to counter these allegations with\nconcrete and material evidences rather a bald statements of denial has been\nmade by Revenue which is not sufficient enough to fasten tax liability in the\ninstant case keeping in view nature of serious allegation raised by the\nassessee and the entire factual matrix surrounding the case. The assessee\nhas retracted the said statement within few days of the making of the said\nstatement on 19-09-2008 during course of survey proceedings vide\nadvocates letter dated 29-09-2008 as well retraction letter dated 16-10-2008\nfiled by the assessee. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"346493\" id=\"span_25\">The Ld. CIT-A has rightly appreciated the stand of the\nassessee in deleting the      additions   as the    revenue   has no cogent\nincriminating materiel with it to justify the addition of Rs. 1.2 crores apart\nfrom the forced confessional statement which is involuntary in nature. The\nloose document impounded being page no 175 during survey operations is\nheld by us to be dumb document which is alleged by the assessee to have\nbeen prepared at the time of survey itself at the behest of survey team to\njustify surrender of concealed income. The said statement as well material\non record keeping in view the entire factual spectrum of the case does not\ninspire confidence to justify the additions as was made by the AO and in our\nconsidered view the learned CIT(A) has rightly appreciated the entire factual\nmatrix of the case and deleted the additions vide his appellate order. The\nassessee has rightly relied upon the decision in the case of <a href=\"/doc/346493/\" id=\"a_53\">CIT v. Dhingra\nMetal Works</a> in ITA no. 1111/2010 vide orders dated 04-10-2010. Search\nand Surveys conducted under the provisions of the 1961 Act is an serious\ninfringement of Right to life and liberty of the person searched/surveyed as\nenshrined in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_54\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India as it impinges on Right to\nPrivacy and it cannot be carried out in a casual manner except through the\nprocedures established by law which also entailed that there will be no use\nof coercion, fraud, threat or force during the course of these proceedings in\nobtaining confessions as well incriminating material to prejudice the persons\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">                                   22</span>\n                                                                I.T.A. No. 820/Mum/2015\n\n\nsearched/survey.       What is relevant under these circumstances is to see\nwhether the additions can be made independent of the retracted statement\nbased on incriminating material on record and if it is so possible then there\nis no need to rely on the retracted statement. The said statement can be\nused as an aid for making additions based on incriminating material on\nrecord and if the additions can be independently sustained based on\nincriminating material on record , then there is no need to call for the forced\nconfessional statement in aid which stood retracted .</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1924452\" id=\"span_27\">The decision of the\nHon‟ble Supreme Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1924452/\" id=\"a_55\">Kashmira Singh v. State of Madhya\nPradesh</a> reported in 1952 AIR 159 is also relevant so far as factual matrix of\nthe instant case is concerned. In the instant case, if we eschew the said\nretracted forced confession from record, then we are afraid there are no\nincriminating material on record to justify additions as was made by the AO\nwhich learned CIT(A) has rightly appreciated in deleting the additions vide\nhis appellate orders. The Revenue in the instant case has not even bothered\nto cross examine the partner of the assessee post retraction of his statement.\nThe retraction has been made by the assessee within 10 days of the\naforesaid alleged forced statement and writ petition has also been filed with\nHon‟ble Bombay High Court. There are several letters written by the assessee\nto various authorities within Income Tax Department including CBDT\nalleging that the statement was obtained forcibly by survey team . These\ncorrespondences/writ petition sans absence of cogent incriminating material\non record to prejudice the assessee speak loudly and points to one and only\none irresistible      conclusion that Revenue has obtained forced confession\nfrom the assessee to surrender income of Rs. 1.20 crores and we have no\nhesitation in confirming the well reasoned order of the Ld. CIT-A which we\naffim/sustain. Thus, Revenue fails in this appeal which stands dismissed.\nWe order accordingly.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">8.
