As far as the delay in preferring the appeal is concerned, the\nappellants, in the application for condonation of delay, have attributed the\nsame to (i) suspension of the period of limitation during the prevalent\nCovid-19 pandemic; and, (ii) the appellant no.2, who is the authorized\nsignatory of the appellant no.1, being unwell and the old age of his mother.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_4\">4.

CM No.11906/2021 is disposed of.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">7.    The respondent no.1 filed OMP (ENF.) (COMM.) No.140/2019 for\nexecution of the arbitral award dated 11th March, 2019 as a decree of the\nCourt, describing itself as the decree holder and the two appellants and the\nrespondent no.2 as the judgment debtors, and pleading that a total amount\nof Rs.21,17,80,487/- was due as on 11th July, 2019, jointly and severally\nfrom the two appellants and the respondent no.2 [hereinafter together\nreferred to as &quot;judgment debtors&quot;] to the respondent no.1 [hereinafter\nreferred to as &quot;decree holder&quot;] under the award dated 11th March, 2019.

In paragraph 11 of the Execution Petition,\nrequiring the decree holder to furnish &quot;Any other information&quot;, the decree\nholder pleaded, that (i) the judgment debtors had failed to make payment of\nthe awarded amount to the decree holder; (ii) the decree was to be executed\njointly and severally against the judgment debtors; and, (iii) &quot;To the best of\nthe knowledge of the decree holder, the judgment debtors have assets and\nproperties, movable and immovable&quot;. The decree holder, in the prayer\nparagraph of the Execution Petition, sought (a) a direction to the judgment\ndebtors to pay to the decree holder the awarded amount with interest, in\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">EFA (OS)(COMM) No.4/2021                                         Page 3 of 51</span>\n terms of the arbitral award dated 11th March, 2019; (b) to restrain the\njudgment debtors from alienating any movable and immovable properties;\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_8\">(c) attachment of any rental or income being derived by the judgment\ndebtors from the immovable properties; and, (d) attachment and sale of\nmovable and immovable properties of the judgment debtors. The Execution\nPetition was accompanied with a &quot;Schedule of Properties&quot;, wherein the\ndecree holder listed, (i) property no.4, Ansari Road, Daryaganj, New Delhi\nand property no.A-8 (Site IV) Link Road, Sahibabad, District Ghaziabad\n(UP) as the properties of appellant no.1/judgment debtor, (ii) property\nno.66, East Friends Colony, New Delhi and property no.227, Siddharth\nEnclave, New Delhi as the properties of appellant no.2/judgment debtor,\nand (iii) property no.66A, East Friends Colony, New Delhi and property\nno.A-20, New Friends Colony (East), New Delhi as the properties of one\nTrustline Real Estate Pvt. Ltd. in which the appellant no.2/judgment debtor\nheld a 95.2% shareholding.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_9\">8.    It appears that when the Execution Petition came up before the\nCommercial Division on 30th August, 2019, the Commercial Division, in\nexercise of powers under Order XXI Rule 41(2) <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_8\">of the CPC</a>, directed the\njudgment debtors to file affidavits of their assets, in Form 16A, Appendix E\n<a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_9\">of the CPC</a>. The Commercial Division, vide order dated 3rd December,\n2019, further directed the judgment debtors to file additional affidavits, as\nper Annexures to the said order, together with documents required to be\nfurnished in accordance with the said annexures.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">EFA (OS)(COMM) No.4/2021                                        Page 4 of 51</span>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_10\"> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"140744706\" id=\"span_8\">9.    A perusal of the impugned order dated 23rd December, 2019 shows,\nthat on the judgment debtors seeking further time to file additional\naffidavits as directed, the Commercial Division, while granting such time,\nmodified the earlier order dated 3rd December, 2019 and directed that\ninstead of the additional affidavits being filed in terms of annexures to the\norder dated 3rd December, 2019, the additional affidavits be filed as per\nannexures to <a href=\"/doc/140744706/\" id=\"a_10\">Bhandari Engineers &amp; Builders Pvt. Ltd.</a> supra.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_11\">10.   The judgment debtors filed EA No.217/2020 and Review Petition\nNo.64/2020, seeking exemption from filing of the additional affidavits as\ndirected, on the ground of confidentiality of personal information and\ndocuments and on the ground that the decree holder was sufficiently\nprotected under the arbitral award, of which enforcement was sought. The\nCommercial Division however, vide order dated 13th March, 2020 disposed\nof the said applications holding that the judgment debtors could not be\nexempted from filing the affidavits merely on the ground that the decree\nholder was sufficiently secured; with respect to the plea of confidentiality of\nthe personal information, the judgment debtors were permitted to file\nconfidential information / documents in sealed covers and the plea of\nconfidentiality left open to be considered at an appropriate stage.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_12\">11.   The judgment debtors have preferred this appeal, pleading that (i) the\njudgment debtors, as owners of a plot of land no.A-8 (Site IV) Link Road,\nSahibabad, District Ghaziabad (UP) had entered into a Collaboration\nAgreement with the decree holder, for development of the said property and\non disputes and differences arising between the parties, the same were\nreferred to arbitration; (ii) the Arbitral Tribunal held that the judgment\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">EFA (OS)(COMM) No.4/2021                                          Page 5 of 51</span>\n debtors were liable to pay the awarded amount to the decree holder and the\ndecree holder was liable to hand back vacant peaceful physical possession\nof the plot of land aforesaid to the judgment debtors; (iii) the Arbitral\nTribunal further held that the decree holder was entitled to hold possession\nof the said plot of land till payment of the awarded amount by the judgment\ndebtors to the decree holder; (iv) the judgment debtors have filed an\napplication under <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 34</a> of the Arbitration &amp; Conciliation Act, 1996\nwith respect to the award and which application was pending consideration;\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_13\">(v) the decree holder accepted the arbitral award in toto and had filed\nOMP(ENF.)(COMM) No.140/2019 in execution thereof; (vi) though Order\nXXI Rule 41(2) <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_12\">of the CPC</a> provides for a direction to the judgment debtor\nto file affidavit in the form prescribed therein only when the decree for\npayment of money had remained unsatisfied for a period of 30 days and\nonly on the application of the decree holder, the Commercial Division, in\nviolation thereof had directed filing of affidavits without there being any\napplication of the decree holder therefor and without the decree having\nremained unsatisfied; (vii) there was thus no justification for the\nCommercial Division to direct filing of affidavits by the judgment debtors;\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_14\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"140744706\" id=\"span_10\">(viii) that the dicta in <a href=\"/doc/140744706/\" id=\"a_13\">Bhandari Engineers &amp; Builders Pvt.

Though in\nDelhi there are no Commercial Courts below the level of the District Judge\nbut since both, <a href=\"/doc/18671421/\" id=\"a_183\">Section 13(1)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/44411053/\" id=\"a_184\">Section 13(1A)</a> provide for appeals arising\nfrom commercial disputes and there being nothing in the proviso to indicate\nthat the same is applicable only to <a href=\"/doc/44411053/\" id=\"a_185\">Section 13(1A)</a>, we conclude that the\nproviso applies to both, <a href=\"/doc/18671421/\" id=\"a_186\">Section 13(1)</a> as well as <a href=\"/doc/44411053/\" id=\"a_187\">Section 13(1A)</a>.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_41\">28.   As far as the contention of the senior counsels for the judgment\ndebtors, of proceedings for execution of an arbitral award as a decree being\nnot within the jurisdiction of the Commercial Court / Commercial Division\nof this Court is concerned, <a href=\"/doc/132700916/\" id=\"a_188\">Section 10</a> of the Commercial Courts Act inter\nalia provides that where the subject matter of an arbitration is a commercial\ndispute of a specified value, all applications or appeals arising out of such\nan arbitration under the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_189\">Arbitration Act</a> that have been\nfiled on the original side of the Court shall be heard and disposed of by the\nCommercial Division, where such Commercial Division has been\nconstituted in the High Court. It is not in dispute that the subject matter of\nthe arbitration, award whereof is under execution, was of the specified\nvalue. The arbitration concerned adjudication of rights and obligations\narising between the decree holder and the judgment debtors from\nagreements entered into between them with respect to an industrial plot of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_98\">EFA (OS)(COMM) No.4/2021                                         Page 27 of 51</span>\n land at Sahibabad. While it was the contention of the decree holder that it\nwas an agreement for sale of the said land by the judgment debtors to the\ndecree holder, the judgment debtors contended the agreement to be a\nCollaboration Agreement whereunder the decree holder had agreed to raise\nconstruction on the land of the judgment debtors for the consideration of\nsharing a portion of the constructed area. The arbitral award negates the\ncontention of the decree holder, of the agreement being of sale and has held\nthe decree holder to be only entitled to reimbursement of the amounts\nincurred pursuant to the agreement. Such a dispute, under clauses (vi) and\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_42\">(vii) of <a href=\"/doc/46356160/\" id=\"a_190\">Section 2(1)(c)</a> of the Commercial Courts Act read with Explanation\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_43\">(a) thereto, constitutes a commercial dispute. Thus the subject matter of\narbitration in the present case was a commercial dispute of a specified\nvalue, within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/499427/\" id=\"a_191\">Section 10</a> of the Arbitration Act. To be fair to\nthe senior counsels for the judgment debtors, they did not seriously\ncontrovert the aforesaid. Their contention however was that since this\nappeal does not arise out of arbitration under the provisions of the\n<a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_192\">Arbitration Act</a>, within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/1559658/\" id=\"a_193\">Section 10(2)</a> of the Arbitration Act,\nthe execution was not within the jurisdiction of the Commercial Division\nand the appeal thereagainst does not lie to the Commercial Appellate\nDivision, under <a href=\"/doc/44411053/\" id=\"a_194\">Section 13</a> of the Commercial Courts Act. It was further\ncontended that the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_195\">Arbitration Act</a> is concerned only with the arbitration\nproceedings and challenge to the arbitral award and is not concerned with\nexecution of the arbitral award, with the Act, in Section 36 merely\nproviding for the award to be executed as a decree of the Civil Court in\naccordance with the provisions <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_196\">of the CPC</a>. It was contended that the\nExecution Petition is thus not an application arising out of arbitration under\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_99\">EFA (OS)(COMM) No.4/2021                                         Page 28 of 51</span>\n the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_197\">Arbitration Act</a>, to be entertained by the Commercial Division of this\nCourt.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_44\">29.      Needless to state, this question also was not raised before and has not\nbeen considered by the Commercial Division in any of the orders in the\nsubject execution proceedings.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_45\">30.      Though in appeal, ordinarily we would not allow a new plea to be\nurged but finding the same to be of general importance, having application\nin a large number of cases, proceed to do so.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_46\">31.      <a href=\"/doc/46356160/\" id=\"a_198\">Section 2(1)(c)</a> defines &quot;commercial disputes&quot; as a &quot;dispute&quot; arising\nout of agreements, transactions, relationships, of the nature specified in\nvarious clauses thereunder. <a href=\"/doc/177699642/\" id=\"a_199\">Sections 6</a> and <a href=\"/doc/42091233/\" id=\"a_200\">7</a> of the Commercial Courts Act\nvest jurisdiction in the Commercial Court / Commercial Division, to try &quot;all\nsuits and applications relating to commercial disputes of a specified value&quot;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_47\">32.      According to the senior counsels for the judgment debtors, the\njurisdiction of the Commercial Courts / Commercial Divisions is only over\nsuits / arbitrations, subject matter whereof qualifies as a commercial dispute\nand not over proceedings for execution of the decrees passed in the said\nsuits or over enforcement of awards passed in the said arbitrations. The\nquestion which arises is, whether a claim made by one against the other and\ncontroverted by the other, on adjudication thereof, whether by the Court or\nby the Arbitrator, ceases to be a &quot;dispute&quot;, for it to be said that the\nproceedings for execution of adjudication of a commercial dispute, whether\nby way of a decree or an arbitral award, do not qualify as a &quot;dispute&quot;.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_100\">EFA (OS)(COMM) No.4/2021                                           Page 29 of 51</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_48\"> 33.   <a href=\"/doc/158197331/\" id=\"a_201\">Section 2(1)(i)</a> of the Commercial Courts Act defines &quot;Specified\nValue&quot; in relation to a commercial dispute, as the value of a subject matter\nin respect of a suit as determined in accordance with Section 12. Reference\ntherein is thus expressly to a &quot;suit&quot;, as distinct from an &quot;execution&quot;.\nSection 12 however refers to the specified value of the subject matter of the\ncommercial dispute in a suit, appeal or application. Thereby, the ambit of\nspecified value is increased, from that in <a href=\"/doc/158197331/\" id=\"a_202\">Section 2(1)(i)</a>, with reference to a\n&quot;suit&quot; alone, to an appeal or an application also. Finally, <a href=\"/doc/177699642/\" id=\"a_203\">Sections 6</a> and <a href=\"/doc/42091233/\" id=\"a_204\">7</a>,\nwhile prescribing the jurisdiction of Commercial Courts and Commercial\nDivisions, prescribe the said jurisdiction, to extend to try all suits and\napplications relating to a commercial dispute, again, vesting the jurisdiction\nin the Commercial Courts / Commercial Divisions, not only to try &quot;suits&quot;\nbut also &quot;applications&quot;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_49\">34.   The question which arises is, whether Execution Petitions are\n&quot;applications&quot; within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/132700916/\" id=\"a_205\">Sections 10</a>, <a href=\"/doc/24236663/\" id=\"a_206\">12</a>, <a href=\"/doc/177699642/\" id=\"a_207\">6</a> and <a href=\"/doc/42091233/\" id=\"a_208\">7</a> of the\nCommercial Courts Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_50\">35.   &quot;Dispute&quot; is defined as a disagreement or argument between two\npeople. &quot;Application&quot; is defined as a formal written request.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_51\">36.   It is not as if, on adjudication of a dispute, resulting in a judgment /\ndecree of a Court or award of an Arbitral Tribunal, the &quot;dispute&quot; between\nthe parties comes to an end or nothing remains to be adjudicated between\nthe parties. <a href=\"/doc/119552888/\" id=\"a_209\">Section 47</a> of the CPC, in Part-II titled &quot;Execution&quot; itself, in\nthis respect provides that all questions arising between the parties to the suit\nin which the decree was passed, or their representatives, and relating to\nexecution, discharge or satisfaction of the decree, shall be determined by the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_101\">EFA (OS)(COMM) No.4/2021                                           Page 30 of 51</span>\n Court executing the decree and not by a separate suit. It is evident therefrom\nthat a judgment or a decree of the Court or the award of an Arbitral\nTribunal, do not put an end to the &quot;dispute&quot; between the parties and it is not\nas if execution is merely an administrative task, with no adjudication\ninvolved. It would be incongruous to hold that the jurisdiction of the\nCommercial Courts / Commercial Divisions extends only to adjudication of\ncommercial disputes till the stage of adjudication and not to adjudication of\ncommercial disputes arising in the course of execution. Once it is so, the\nword &quot;dispute&quot; in <a href=\"/doc/46356160/\" id=\"a_210\">Section 2(1)(c)</a> would extend to adjudication of disputes\narising during execution of arbitral awards subject whereof falls within the\njurisdiction of the <a href=\"/doc/24236663/\" id=\"a_211\">Commercial Courts Act</a> and the Commercial Court and\nCommercial Division would also have jurisdiction over the applications for\nexecution of arbitral awards of a specified value, subject matter whereof\nwas a commercial dispute.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_52\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"152751819\" id=\"span_102\">37.   There is another aspect. A claimant in a dispute is not interested\nmerely in adjudication thereof. The claimant is interested in delivery to\nhim, of what he claims to be due and what has been adjudicated to be due to\nhim from the opposite party. <a href=\"/doc/24236663/\" id=\"a_212\">The Commercial Courts Act</a>, as <a href=\"/doc/140744706/\" id=\"a_213\">laid down in</a>\n<a href=\"/doc/152751819/\" id=\"a_214\">HPL (India) Ltd.</a> supra also, was enacted to provide for speedy disposal of\nhigh value commercial disputes and their early resolution.

To hold that the\nCommercial Courts / Commercial Divisions would not have jurisdiction\nover applications for execution of a judgment or decree or for enforcement\nof an arbitral award, subject matter whereof was a commercial dispute,\nwould in our opinion sound the death knell for the objective behind setting\nup of the Commercial Courts and the Commercial Divisions.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_53\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"65333076\" id=\"span_104\">38.

Thus <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_218\">the\nCPC</a>, in accordance wherewith an arbitral award is to be executed/enforced,\nenvisages such execution to be by way of an „application‟ and since the\njurisdiction of the Commercial Courts / Commercial Divisions extends vide\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_105\">EFA (OS)(COMM) No.4/2021                                       Page 32 of 51</span>\n <a href=\"/doc/177699642/\" id=\"a_219\">Sections 6</a> and <a href=\"/doc/42091233/\" id=\"a_220\">7</a> of the Commercial Courts Act extends, besides over suits,\nalso over applications relating to commercial disputes, such jurisdiction\nwould also extend over execution applications.

After\nobserving so, the Court, in purported exercise of power under Section 151\nand <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_252\">Order XXI Rule 41 of the CPC</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/697566/\" id=\"a_253\">Sections 106</a> and <a href=\"/doc/302809/\" id=\"a_254\">165</a> of the\nIndian Evidence Act and <a href=\"/doc/1331149/\" id=\"a_255\">Article 227</a> of the Constitution of India, proceeded\nto formulate/draft an affidavit of assets and income, to be mandatorily filed\nby the judgment debtor in execution proceedings. Though the Court, in the\nearlier part of the judgment had noted that the need for directing such\naffidavit to be filed would arise only when the decree holder was not aware\nof the assets of the judgment debtor, but in the concluding portion of the\njudgment, the Court proceeded to issue a direction to all courts executing a\ndecree for recovery of money, to, in the first instance direct the judgment\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_116\">EFA (OS)(COMM) No.4/2021                                         Page 37 of 51</span>\n debtor to file the affidavit in the form as drafted by the Court and directed\nthe copy of <a href=\"/doc/140744706/\" id=\"a_256\">the said judgment</a> to be circulated to all the Courts and others\nconcerned. Vide the third judgment dated 5th December, 2019, certain\nmodifications were carried out in the format devised in the preceding\njudgments.

Section 165 empowers the Court to ask any question at any time to\nany party about any fact relevant or irrelevant. The powers under the said\nprovisions also, are to be exercised in the facts of a particular case and do\nnot extend to issuing a general direction.

It cannot be lost sight of, that the power\nthereunder is vested in the &quot;High Court&quot; and which, in our view, would\nmean the &quot;Full Court&quot; comprising of all the Judges of the High Court and\nnot in individual Judges presiding over different benches as per the roster\nallocation by Hon‟ble the Chief Justice.

Thus,\nif any individual Judge of the High Court, in the course of adjudication of a\nparticular lis or otherwise is of the opinion of the need for any change to be\nmade in the procedure prescribed in any of the Orders in Schedule I <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_317\">of the\nCPC</a>, the same has to be put up to Hon‟ble the Chief Justice for, if so\ndesires, forwarding the same to the Rules Committee for considering the\nproposal.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"140744706\" id=\"span_147\">The Hon‟ble Judge, in <a href=\"/doc/140744706/\" id=\"a_318\">Bhandari Engineers &amp; Builders Pvt.

The aforesaid provisions having prescribed the\nprocedure for formulating Rules and / or for making changes in Orders I to\nLI and Appendix A to H to <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_319\">the CPC</a>, Rules / changes could not be made\nwithout following the said procedure.</span>\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_148\">EFA (OS)(COMM) No.4/2021                                            Page 45 of 51</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_72\"> 56.   We may notice that the Supreme Court, in Rahul S. Shah supra also,\nthough has felt the need for changes in the procedure for execution, has\nonly directed the High Courts to reconsider and update the Rules in exercise\nof powers under <a href=\"/doc/1331149/\" id=\"a_320\">Article 227</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/38214069/\" id=\"a_321\">Section 122</a> of the CPC.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_73\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"140744706\" id=\"span_149\">57.   We are thus of the view that <a href=\"/doc/140744706/\" id=\"a_322\">Bhandari Engineers &amp; Builders Pvt.\nLtd.</a> supra, to the extent extends what is laid down therein to execution\nproceedings pertaining to all money decrees and to all courts executing a\nmoney decree, cannot said to be good law.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"140744706\" id=\"span_150\">Axiomatically, what is held in\n<a href=\"/doc/140744706/\" id=\"a_323\">Bhandari Engineers &amp; Builders Pvt.

Once it is so, the impugned orders have no other reason whatsoever\nfor directing the judgment debtors to file the affidavits and which are liable\nto be set aside on this ground alone.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_75\">59.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"140744706\" id=\"span_151\">In view of the aforesaid, need is not felt in this case to give other\nreasons for disagreeing with what has been held in <a href=\"/doc/140744706/\" id=\"a_324\">Bhandari Engineers &amp;\nBuilders Pvt. Ltd.</a> supra. Suffice it is to say that considerable merit is found\nin the arguments propounded by the senior counsels for the judgment\ndebtors and some of which arguments have also been accepted by us while\npropounding on the powers of the Court to lay down Rules of general\napplication.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_76\">60.   As far as the facts of the present case are concerned, the respondent\nno.1 / decree holder was aware of the moveable and immovable assets of\nthe appellants / respondent no.2 / judgment debtor and furnished particulars\nthereof in the schedule to the Execution Petition (and one of which\nimmovable assets in terms of the arbitral award was in possession of the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_152\">EFA (OS)(COMM) No.4/2021                                          Page 46 of 51</span>\n decree holder) and sought assistance of the Court in execution of the arbitral\naward as a decree of the Court, by attachment and sale of the said assets.\nThe Commercial Division acting as the executing court, on presentation of\nthe Execution Petition, if preferred within two years of the date of\npublication of the arbitral award, was thus required to immediately attach\nany one of the said properties from which the decretal amount could be\nrecovered and to on the next date, proceed with sale thereof. Instead, the\nCommercial Division, without there being any need thereof, proceeded to\nissue direction to the judgment debtors to disclose their assets.           We\nreiterate, that there was no need therefor once the particulars of the assets\nwere already before the Court and the decree holder also rightly had not\napplied. All this, rather than expediting execution, has delayed the cause of\nthe decree holder. Surprisingly, the decree holder did not oppose such\ndirections, which were resulting in delaying recoveries of the monies due to\nthe decree holder under the arbitral award and of recovery whereof there\nwas no stay.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_77\">61.   As far as the contention of the senior counsels for the judgment\ndebtors, that the decree holder being already in possession of one of the\nimmovable properties of the judgment debtors, was not entitled to proceed\nwith the execution, is concerned, no merit is found therein. Being in\npossession of one of the properties of the judgment debtors and which\nproperty is a plot of land, does not put the monies found due to the decree\nholder under the arbitral award, in the pocket of the decree holder. The\ndecree holder cannot be expected to sit quiet till the judgment debtor opts to\ntake possession of the said property.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_153\">EFA (OS)(COMM) No.4/2021                                         Page 47 of 51</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_78\"> 62.   As per the existing provisions of <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_325\">Order XXI Rule 41 of the CPC</a>, the\nCommercial Division, in our view erred in issuing direction to judgment\ndebtors to file affidavits and affidavits in a form other than as prescribed in\n<a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_326\">the CPC</a>. The impugned orders do not record that the decree holder had\napplied therefor, verbally or in writing. A direction under Order XXI Rule\n41 could not have been issued without the decree holder applying therefor.\nSuch direction could not have been issued without, inspite of taking steps\nand owing to obstruction by the judgment debtor, the decree remaining\nunsatisfied. No reason whatsoever has been given in the impugned orders as\nto why the directions as issued were called for in the facts of the case or\nwhy affidavit in the form prescribed in <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_327\">the CPC</a> could not have sufficed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_79\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"140744706\" id=\"span_154\">63.   Merit is also found in the contentions of the senior counsels for the\njudgment debtors, that direction to judgment debtor/s in terms of <a href=\"/doc/140744706/\" id=\"a_328\">Bhandari\nEngineers &amp; Builders Pvt. Ltd.</a> supra, in all cases of execution of money\ndecrees, irrespective of the need therefor, causes prejudice to the judgment\ndebtor/s and is in breach of right of privacy of the judgment debtor/s.\nMerely because a person has a money decree against him, does not make\nthe said person susceptible in law to a roving and fishing enquiry into all his\naffairs; such a person, in law, can be compelled to disclose to only such\nextent as may be necessary for execution of the decree against him.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1741605\" id=\"span_155\">The\nprinciples, as enunciated in <a href=\"/doc/1741605/\" id=\"a_329\">Jolly George Varghese Vs.

It\nwas held therein that the high value of human dignity and the worth of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_156\">EFA (OS)(COMM) No.4/2021                                          Page 48 of 51</span>\n human person enshrined in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_330\">Article 21</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_331\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_332\">19</a> of the\nConstitution of India obligates the state not to incarcerate except under law\nwhich is fair, just and reasonable in its procedural essence; to cast the\nperson in prison because of his poverty and consequent inability to meet his\ncontractual liability, was held to be appalling.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"140744706\" id=\"span_157\">Applying the said principles,\na judgment debtor in a money decree, cannot in a routine manner, be\ndirected to disclose all the information as has been directed to be disclosed\nin the affidavits formulated in <a href=\"/doc/140744706/\" id=\"a_333\">Bhandari Engineers &amp; Builders Pvt. Ltd.</a>\nsupra and which information indeed is far reaching, affecting the\nsubstantive rights of the judgment debtor.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1466398\" id=\"span_158\">In <a href=\"/doc/1466398/\" id=\"a_334\">Vinod Seth</a> supra it was held\nthat <a href=\"/doc/56600062/\" id=\"a_335\">Section 151</a> of the CPC is not a provision of law conferring power to\ngrant any kind of substantive relief; it is a procedural provision saving the\ninherent power of the Court to make such orders as may be necessary for\nthe ends of justice and to prevent abuse of the process of the Court; it\ncannot be used either to create or recognize rights or to create liabilities and\nobligations not contemplated in law. It was further held that the inherent\npowers saved by <a href=\"/doc/56600062/\" id=\"a_336\">Section 151</a> of the CPC are with respect to the procedure\nto be followed by the Court and are not powers over the substantive rights\nwhich any litigant possesses. It follows, that the Court, without giving\nreasons in the facts of a particular case, cannot infringe substantive rights of\nprivacy of an individual merely because he happens to be a judgment debtor\nunder a money decree.</span>       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"140744706\" id=\"span_159\">Though the purpose with which the Court in\n<a href=\"/doc/140744706/\" id=\"a_337\">Bhandari Engineers &amp; Builders Pvt.

No merit is found in the contention of the counsel for the respondent\nno.1 / decree holder, that the judgment debtors having not challenged the\norder dated 3rd December, 2019, are not entitled to challenge the subsequent\norders. The order dated 3rd December, 2019 stood substituted by the order\ndated 23rd December, 2019 and not challenging the order dated 3 rd\nDecember, 2019 which ceased to exist, cannot deprive the judgment debtors\nfrom challenging the order dated 23rd December, 2019. Similarly, no merit\nis found in the argument, that the judgment debtors, in the review petition\nhaving themselves, in the alternative having offered to furnish particulars\nwith respect to which confidentiality was claimed in a sealed cover, are not\nentitled to maintain the appeal. The primary / first relief claimed in the\nreview petition having been declined, the judgment debtors are within their\nright to challenge the denial thereof. Law permits a litigant to claim reliefs\nin alternative and merely because a relief claimed in the alternative has been\ngranted cannot come in the way of impugning the denial of primary / first\nrelief.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_81\">65.
