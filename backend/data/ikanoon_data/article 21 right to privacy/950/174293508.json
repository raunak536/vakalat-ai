If that is not available, there is\n\nnothing other than that the Union Government needs to answer\n\nin the lis.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                 13</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_21\">\n\n\n\nSubmissions of the complainant:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_22\">     8.

The   learned   Additional   Government     Advocate\n\nSmt.

My husband had repeatedly accused me\n      to each and every person who is known to\n      us that I am not offering him sex\n      shamelessly when he had made me as sex\n      slave.    My husband had lodged a false\n      complaint to Vanitha Sahayavani and for the\n      first time I took assistance of my relative to\n      meet the Advocate. I learnt through my\n      Advocate that the person who had called\n      me to the Commissioner&#x27;s office was\n      booked by my husband and there also he\n      had complained that I am not giving him\n      sex and I am sleeping with my daughter.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_34\">      I did not go to the Commissioner office as I\n      know that my husband will be telling lies that\n      I will not give him sex and I sleep with my\n      daughter which he had repeatedly complained\n      to everyone including my mother, uncle and all\n      known persons to me.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_35\">4.    I was victimized to become a sex slave to\n      Mr.Hrushikesh.

I had written\n     all my pains to my Lawyer after I was\n     harassed by Mr.Hrushikesh, Mrs.Shakunthala\n     and Mr.Jaganath Sahoo to get money from\n     disposing my ancestral property worth Rs.1\n     crore and compelled my daughter xxxx to be\n     with them till I get money. My daughter\n     wanted to come to me, my in-laws\n     Mrs.Shakunthala and Mr.Jaganath Sahoo\n     both held my daughter&#x27;s hair and twisted her\n     hand. My husband Mr.Hrushikesh broke my\n     mobile phone in to pieces and broke my\n     fingers. As the neighbouring flat owners came\n     on hearing our screams, my husband and my\n     in-laws let us go. I have collected some pen\n     drives of my husband and hearing the false\n     accusation that I had beaten by my husband\n     to the neighbours. Out of fear of death and\n     harassment I have rushed to my Advocate\n     office.   My Advocate sent me to Nelofar\n     Polyclinic where his client Dr.Mir Iftekhar Ali\n     had come to his office for his legal\n     consultation. I had taken first aid and rushed\n     back to Lawyer&#x27;s office to complete the\n     questions and answer of my daughter&#x27;s\n     problems. The details of the question and\n     answers to which I recorded the question and\n     my      daughter    written     her    answers\n     simultaneously.

My husband did not leave me from\n                giving him forcible sex even after\n                pregnancy and had no courtesy to\n                continue with sex even after my baby got\n                terminated.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_39\">          7.    My husband is totally an inhuman and he\n                forced me to perform all unnatural sex in\n                front of my daughter and many occasions\n                he had beaten her and had forcible sex\n                with me.      There was countless sexual\n                harassment which no female in the world\n                would like to express and I want my name\n                and my daughter&#x27;s name in the complaint to\n                be undisclosed and punish my husband. I\n                am terrible in untold pains from knowing\n                that my husband had sexually harassed\n                my daughter by bringing her early from\n                school and also I do not want any\n                daughter or any mother to undergo the\n                sufferings which both me and my\n                daughter have suffered.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_40\">          I, therefore kindly request you to offer social security\n          by immediately offering rehabilitation for both me\n          and my daughter and punish my husband and in-\n          laws for all the injustice caused to me and my\n          daughter.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_41\">                                          (Emphasis is mine)\n\nThis is the genesis of the issue before the competent Court.\n\nAfter registration of the complaint for offences under Sections\n\n498A, 377, 354 and 506 read with the provisions of the Act as\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                                            21</span>\n\n\n\nquoted hereinabove, investigation was conducted into the\n\nmatter.

During the pendency of the proceedings before the\n\nSessions Court, the complainant/wife has further addressed\n\ncommunications to all quarters seeking help and in the\n\nnarration again has clearly indicated as to how brutal the\n\npetitioner used to have sex, anal sex with the complainant/wife\n\nin the presence of his daughter who was 9 years old at that point\n\nin time and later used to touch the private parts of the daughter\n\nand also indulged in sexual acts against the daughter.

The issue with regard\n\nto daughter which comes under the Act will be dealt with, by me\n\na little later. It is now time in the journey of this order to\n\nconsider whether cognizance taken and rejection of the prayer\n\nfor dropping the charge under <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_67\">Section 376</a> of IPC suffers from\n\nwant of legal tenability in the peculiar facts of the case.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_47\">      17. Since the sheet anchor of the submission of the\n\nlearned senior counsel is with regard to the exemption or\n\nexception of husband under <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_68\">Section 375</a> of the IPC, it is\n\ngermane to notice <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_69\">Section 375</a> of the IPC from its inception. The\n\ngenesis of <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_70\">Section 375</a> of the IPC and its exception has its roots\n\nin the Code propounded by Macaulay in 1837. It is Macaulay&#x27;s\n\nCode that becomes the basis for the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_71\">Indian Penal Code</a> of 1860,\n\nwhich governs the penal provisions even as on date with certain\n\nchanges on certain occasions. Exception to Section 375 has\n\nexisted in the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_72\">IPC</a> since the time of its enactment by the British\n\nin the year 1860. Exception-2 then was guided by the laws that\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                               26</span>\n\n\n\nwere existent in all the countries where the British had their foot\n\non. They were several decades ago. It was founded and remained\n\non the premise of a contract in the medieval law that husbands\n\nwielded their power over their wives. In the Victorian era women\n\nwere denied the exercise of basic rights and liberties and had\n\nlittle autonomy over their choice. Their statuses were nothing\n\nbeyond than that of materialistic choices and were treated as\n\nchattels.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_48\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_49\">     18. Post Republic, India is governed by the Constitution.\n\nThe Constitution treats woman equal to man and considers\n\nmarriage as an association of equals. The Constitution does not\n\nin any sense depict the woman to be subordinate to a man. The\n\nConstitution guarantees fundamental rights under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_73\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_74\">,\n\n15</a><a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_75\">, 19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_76\">21</a> which are right to live with dignity, personal\n\nliberty, bodily integrity, sexual autonomy, right to reproductive\n\nchoices, right to privacy, right to freedom of speech and\n\nexpression. Under the Constitution, the rights are equal;\n\nprotection is also equal.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                                 27</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_50\">\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_51\">      19. Close to eight score and three years, the need to tinker\n\nwith <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_77\">Section 375</a> of the IPC did not arise. A fateful incident of a\n\ngang rape in the capital led to the Union Government\n\nconstituting a Committee headed by Justice J.S.Verma, to\n\nsuggest amendments dealing with sexual offences in the Code.\n\nThe Committee, after prolonged deliberations, gave several\n\nrecommendations for amendments to criminal law.            One such\n\nwas   concerning     &#x27;Marital   Rape&#x27;.    The    observations      and\n\nrecommendations of the Committee that are germane to be\n\nnoticed are as follows:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_52\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">             &quot;15. The Committee is conscious of the\n      recommendations in respect of India made by the UN\n      Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against\n      Women (&quot;CEDAW Committee&quot;) in February 2007. The\n      CEDAW Committee has recommended that the country\n      should &quot;widen the definition of rape in its Penal Code to\n      reflect the realities of sexual abuse experienced by women\n      and to remove the exception of marital rape from the\n      definition of rape.....&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_53\">            72. The exemption for marital rape stems from a long\n      out-dated notion of marriage which regarded wives as no\n      more than the property of their husbands. According to the\n      common law of coverture, a wife was deemed to have\n      consented at the time of the marriage to have intercourse\n      with her husband at his whim. Moreover, this consent\n      could not be revoked. As far back as 1736, Sir Matthew\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">                            28</span>\n\n\n\nHale declared: &#x27;The husband cannot be guilty of rape\ncommitted by himself upon his lawful wife, for by their\nmutual matrimonial consent and contract the wife hath\ngiven herself up in this kind unto her husband which she\ncannot retract&#x27;.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_54\">      73. This immunity has now been withdrawn in most\nmajor jurisdictions. In England and Wales, the House of\nLords held in 1991 that the status of married women had\nchanged beyond all recognition since Hale set out his\nproposition. Most importantly, Lord Keith, speaking for the\nCourt, declared, &#x27;marriage is in modern times regarded as\na partnership of equals, and no longer one in which the\nwife must be the subservient chattel of the husband.&#x27;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_55\">       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"139225647\" id=\"span_22\">74. Our view is supported by the judgment of the\nEuropean Commission of Human Rights in <a href=\"/doc/139225647/\" id=\"a_78\">C.R. v UK</a>,\nwhich endorsed the conclusion that a rapist remains a\nrapist regardless of his relationship with the victim.\nImportantly, it acknowledged that this change in the\ncommon law was in accordance with the fundamental\nobjectives of the Convention on Human Rights, the very\nessence of which is respect for human rights, dignity and\nfreedom. This was given statutory recognition in the\nCriminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_56\">       75. We find that the same is true in Canada, South\nAfrica and Australia. In Canada, the provisions in the\nCriminal Code, which denied criminal liability for marital\nrape, were repealed in 1983. It is now a crime in Canada\nfor a husband to rape his wife. South Africa criminalised\nmarital rape in 1993, reversing the common law principle\nthat a husband could not be found guilty of raping his wife.\nSection 5 of the Prevention of Family Violence Act 1993\nprovides: &#x27;Notwithstanding anything to the contrary\ncontained in any law or in the common law, a husband\nmay be convicted of the rape of his wife.&#x27; In Australia, the\ncommon law &#x27;marital rape immunity&#x27; was legislatively\nabolished in all jurisdictions from 1976. In 1991, the\nAustralian High Court had no doubt that: &#x27;if it was ever the\ncommon law that by marriage a wife gave irrevocable\nconsent to sexual intercourse by her husband, it is no\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">                             29</span>\n\n\n\nlonger the common law.&#x27; According to Justice Brennan (as\nhe then was): &#x27;The common law fiction has always been\noffensive to human dignity and incompatible with the legal\nstatus of a spouse.&#x27;\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_57\">       76. These jurisdictions have also gone further and\nrecognised that consent should not be implied by the\nrelationship between the accused and the complainant in\nany event. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"95017292\" id=\"span_24\">In the Canadian 2011 Supreme Court decision\nin <a href=\"/doc/95017292/\" id=\"a_79\">R v. J.A., Chief Justice McLachlin</a> emphasised that the\nrelationship between the accused and the complainant\n&#x27;does not change the nature of the inquiry into whether the\ncomplaint consented&#x27; to the sexual activity. The defendant\ncannot argue that the complainant&#x27;s consent was implied\nby the relationship between the accused and the\ncomplainant. In South Africa, the 2007 Criminal Law\n(Sexual Offences and Related Matters) Amendment Act\n(&#x27;Sexual Offences Act&#x27;) provides, at s. 56 (1), that a marital\nor other relationship between the perpetrator or victim is\nnot a valid defence against the crimes of rape or sexual\nviolation.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_58\">      77. Even when marital rape is recognised as a crime,\nthere is a risk that judges might regard marital rape as\nless serious than other forms of rape, requiring more\nlenient sentences, as happened in South Africa. In\nresponse, the South African Criminal Law (Sentencing) Act\nof 2007 now provides that the relationship between the\nvictim and the accused may not be regarded as a\n&#x27;substantial and compelling circumstance&#x27; justifying a\ndeviation from legislatively required minimum sentences for\nrape.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_59\">       78. It is also important that the legal prohibition on\nmarital rape is accompanied by changes in the attitudes of\nprosecutors, police officers and those in society more\ngenerally. For example, in South Africa, despite these legal\ndevelopments, rates of marital rape remain shockingly\nhigh. A 2010 study suggests that 18.8% of women are\nraped by their partners on one or more occasion. Rates of\nreporting and conviction also remain low, aggravated by\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">                                30</span>\n\n\n\nthe prevalent beliefs that marital rape is acceptable or is\nless serious than other types of rape. Changes in the law\ntherefore need to be accompanied by widespread\nmeasures raising awareness of women&#x27;s rights to\nautonomy and physical integrity, regardless of marriage or\nother intimate relationship. This was underlined in Vertido\nv The Philippines, a recent Communication under the\nOptional Protocol of the Convention on the Elimination of\nDiscrimination Against Women (CEDAW), where the\nCEDAW Committee emphasised the importance of\nappropriate training for judges, lawyers, law enforcement\nofficers and medical personnel in understanding crimes of\nrape and other sexual offences in a gender-sensitive\nmanner.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_60\">      Recommendations\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_61\">      79.

It is, however, felt that\n     a law which makes the practice punishable and at the\n     same time ensures that any dowry, if given does ensure for\n     the benefit of the wife will go a long way to educating\n     public opinion and to the eradication of this evil.

On a coalesce of all the afore-said and afore-quoted\n\nArticles of the Constitution, the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_115\">IPC</a> and\n\nspecific Acts promulgated, what would unmistakably emerge is\n\nthe rights of women, protection of women and their equal status\n\nto that of a man without exception. Therefore, women are equal\n\nin its true sense factually and legally. The aforesaid provisions\n\nare quoted only as a metaphor to demonstrate equality without\n\nexception pervading through the entire spectrum of those\n\nprovisions, the Constitution, the code and the enactments.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">                               47</span>\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_120\">     25.   As   observed   hereinabove,   the   Constitution,   a\n\nfountainhead of all statutes depicts equality. The Code practices\n\ndiscrimination. Under the Code every other man indulging in\n\noffences against woman is punished for those offences. But,\n\nwhen it comes to <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_116\">Section 375</a> of IPC the exception springs. In\n\nmy considered view, the expression is not progressive but\n\nregressive, wherein a woman is treated as a subordinate to the\n\nhusband, which concept abhors equality. It is for this reason\n\nthat several countries have made such acts of the husband\n\npenal by terming it marital rape or spousal rape.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_121\">     26. Marital rape is illegal in 50 American States, 3\n\nAustralian States, New Zealand, Canada, Israel, France, Sweden,\n\nDenmark, Norway, Soviet Union, Poland and Czechoslovakia and\n\nseveral others. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1353689\" id=\"span_43\">In the United Kingdom, which the present Code\n\nlargely draws from, has also removed the exception pursuant to\n\na judgment rendered by the House of Lords in <a href=\"/doc/1353689/\" id=\"a_117\">R v. R</a> in the year\n\n1991. Therefore, the Code that was made by the rulers then, has\n\nitself abolished the exception given to husbands.</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_44\">                                 48</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_122\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"95017292\" id=\"span_45\">27. <a href=\"/doc/95017292/\" id=\"a_118\">Justice Verma Committee</a> (supra) also recommended\n\nfor deletion of the exception of marital rape.             But, the\n\namendment came about was only replacing the word &#x27;rape&#x27; with\n\n&#x27;sexual assault&#x27; in <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_119\">Section 375</a> of IPC. Therefore, the situation\n\nnow emerges is equality pervades through the Constitution, but\n\ninequality exists in the Code qua - Exception-2 to <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_120\">Section 375</a> of\n\nthe IPC.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_123\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_124\">     28. A man who is well acquainted with a woman performs\n\nall the ingredients as is found in pre or post amendment to\n\n<a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_121\">Section 375</a> of the IPC, can be proceeded against for offences\n\npunishable under <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_122\">Section 376</a> of IPC.              Therefore, a man\n\nsexually   assaulting   or   raping   a   woman    is   amenable   to\n\npunishment under <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_123\">Section 376</a> of IPC.        The contention of the\n\nlearned senior counsel that if the man is the husband,\n\nperforming the very same acts as that of another man, he is\n\nexempted. In my considered view, such an argument cannot be\n\ncountenanced. A man is a man; an act is an act; rape is a rape,\n\nbe it performed by a man the &quot;husband&quot; on the woman &quot;wife&quot;.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">                                49</span>\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_125\">     29. The submission of the learned senior counsel that the\n\nhusband is protected by the institution of marriage for any of his\n\nacts being performed, as is performed by a common man, again\n\nsans countenance, for the reason that institution of marriage\n\ndoes not confer, cannot confer and in my considered view,\n\nshould not be construed to confer, any special male privilege or\n\na license for unleashing of a brutal beast. If it is punishable to a\n\nman, it should be punishable to a man albeit, the man being a\n\nhusband.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_126\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_127\">     30. A perusal at the complaint afore-extracted and written\n\ncommunications (which cannot be extracted in the body of the\n\norder) would send a chilling effect on any human being reading\n\nthe contents of it.   The wife-the complainant, cries foul in no\n\nunmistakable terms that she is being brutally, sexually harassed\n\nkeeping her as a sex slave for ages.         The contents of the\n\ncomplaint are an outburst of tolerance of the wife of the brutal\n\nacts of the petitioner.    It is akin to eruption of a dormant\n\nvolcano. In the teeth of the facts, as narrated in the complaint,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">                               50</span>\n\n\n\nin my considered view, no fault can be found with the learned\n\nSessions Judge taking cognizance of the offences punishable\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_124\">Section 376</a> of IPC and framing a charge to that effect.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_128\">     31. The exemption of the husband on committal of such\n\nassault/rape, in the peculiar facts and circumstances of this\n\ncase, cannot be absolute, as no exemption in law can be so\n\nabsolute that it becomes a license for commission of crime\n\nagainst society. Though the four corners of marriage would not\n\nmean society, it is for the legislature to delve upon the issue and\n\nconsider tinkering of the exemption.         This Court is not\n\npronouncing upon whether marital rape should be recognized as\n\nan offence or the exception be taken away by the legislature. It\n\nis for the legislature, on an analysis of manifold circumstances\n\nand ramifications to consider the aforesaid issue. This Court is\n\nconcerned only with the charge of rape being framed upon the\n\nhusband alleging rape on his wife.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_129\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_130\">     32. Every ingredient of rape is met with in the alleged\n\ncomplaint. If it were to be a common man, the allegation on the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">                                  51</span>\n\n\n\nface of it be punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_125\">Section 376</a> of IPC, why not the\n\nhusband-petitioner. It is for the petitioner to come out clean in\n\nthe trial, if he is so much in the defensive of his acts.\n\nInterjecting the trial in the teeth of the aforesaid complaint and\n\nthe charge being framed would become a travesty of justice.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_131\">      33. Therefore, in the light of the ghastly allegations\n\nagainst the petitioner-husband in the complaint and several\n\nother communications, I find no error committed by the learned\n\nSessions Judge in taking cognizance, framing the charge under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_126\">Section 376</a> of the IPC and also rejecting the application to drop\n\nthe said charge. If the allegation of rape is removed from the\n\nblock of offences alleged, it would, in the peculiar facts of this\n\ncase, be doing tremendous injustice to the complainant-wife and\n\nwould amount to putting a premium on the carnal desires of the\n\npetitioner.

The\n\ncomplaint afore-quoted clearly brings out the offence punishable\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_130\">Section 498A</a> of the IPC. <a href=\"/doc/203036/\" id=\"a_131\">Section 354</a> of the IPC which\n\ndeals with assault or criminal force on a woman with intent to\n\noutrage her modesty is clearly met in the complaint. <a href=\"/doc/180217/\" id=\"a_132\">Section 506</a>\n\nof the IPC deals with criminal intimidation which is also met in\n\nthe   complaint.

A.\nrebuttable presumption can be raised only when the\nfoundational facts constituting the offence are established\nby the prosecution. In a criminal trial, the burden of proving\neverything essential to the establishment of the charge\nagainst the accused always rests on the prosecution, as\nevery man is presumed to be innocent until the contrary is\nproved. In a case where an offence is committed\nagainst a child, having regard to the very nature of\nthe offence where it is difficult for the prosecution to\nprove the facts and circumstances in which the\noffence had taken place, the Act has cast the burden\non the accused to prove the facts within his\nknowledge as it is easier for the innocent accused to\nproduce evidence contrary to the case proved by the\nprosecution. This is called reverse burden whereby\nthe burden is shifted to the accused to disprove the\nfacts established by the prosecution. The question of\ndischarging the reverse burden by the accused would\narise only when the initial burden cast on the\nprosecution is discharged to the satisfaction of the\nCourt.

For the same reason, the\nculpable mental state including the intention, motive or\nknowledge of the alleged offence cannot be imputed to the\naccused merely on the basis of the presumption under\n<a href=\"/doc/56956952/\" id=\"a_167\">Section 30</a> of the POCSO Act.

It is also found that\nthough in the light of presumptions, the burden of proof\noscillate between the prosecution and the accused,\ndepending on the quality of evidence let in, in practice\nprocess of adducing evidence in a PoCSO case does not\nsubstantially differ from any other criminal trial.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_149\">       13. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"119075722\" id=\"span_69\">In <a href=\"/doc/119075722/\" id=\"a_182\">David v.

The contention of the learned senior counsel has given\n\nway to the aforesaid issue for consideration of facts and\n\nallegations in the case at hand with regard to offences\n\npunishable under the <a href=\"/doc/13443723/\" id=\"a_199\">Code and the Act</a>. Insofar as the\n\ncomplainant/mother is concerned, the offences are under the\n\nCode. Insofar as the allegations against the daughter are\n\nconcerned, the offences are under the Act.          The complaint\n\nnarrated hereinabove give rise to the offences punishable under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/153588598/\" id=\"a_200\">Sections 5</a> and <a href=\"/doc/183539218/\" id=\"a_201\">6</a> of the Act. The contention of the learned senior\n\ncounsel appearing for the petitioner is that the case is being\n\ntried before the specially designated Court under the Act, which\n\nCourt is not empowered to consider the offences under the Code\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_74\">                                65</span>\n\n\n\nand therefore, the trial has to be segregated. The <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_202\">IPC</a> offences\n\nshould be tried by the designated Court and the POSCO offences\n\nby the special Court. This submission is unacceptable in the\n\npeculiar facts of this case. The mother and the child both are\n\nvictims of brutal acts on the part of the petitioner.      It is the\n\nmother who has complained against the petitioner for the\n\noffences committed by him both on herself and her daughter.\n\nThe mother is also privy to what is narrated in the complaint.\n\nBoth the cases are triable only by the Sessions Court and the\n\nJudge who is now to try both the cases is the Sessions Judge.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_159\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"137074571\" id=\"span_75\">39. In several cases two special enactments come into play\n\nfor a particular offence - one under the Code and the other\n\nunder the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, both of which are\n\ntriable by the Sessions Court. One may involve a child and the\n\nother may involve the offences under Atrocities Act. Therefore, if\n\nthe Court does not have jurisdiction itself to try the offences that\n\nare now alleged, it would have been a different circumstance\n\naltogether and the trial ought to have been segregated.

We have given to the rival submissions our\n         deep consideration and we are of the view that the\n         contention of the respondent must be upheld. It is\n         worth noticing that sub-section (3) of <a href=\"/doc/26275631/\" id=\"a_204\">Section 4</a> of the\n         Act provides that a Special Judge may &quot;also try any\n         offence&quot; other than an offence specified in <a href=\"/doc/189755549/\" id=\"a_205\">Section 3</a>\n         with which the accused may under the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_206\">Code of\n         Criminal Procedure</a> be charged at the same trial. We\n         have observed earlier that the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_207\">Code\n         of Criminal Procedure</a> apply to trials under the Act\n         subject to certain modifications as contained in\n         <a href=\"/doc/20946553/\" id=\"a_208\">Section 22</a> of the Act and their exclusion either\n         express or by necessary implication.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_81\">               13. <a href=\"/doc/1737687/\" id=\"a_209\">Section 223</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure\n         has not been excluded either expressly or by necessary\n         implication nor has the same been modified in its\n         application to trials under the Act. The said provision\n         therefore is applicable to the trial of an offence punishable\n         under the Act. The various provisions of the Act which we\n         have quoted earlier make it abundantly clear that under\n         the provisions of the Act a Special Judge is not precluded\n         altogether from trying any other offence, other than\n         offences specified in <a href=\"/doc/189755549/\" id=\"a_210\">Section 3</a> thereof. A person charged of\n         an offence under the Act may in view of sub-section (3) of\n         <a href=\"/doc/26275631/\" id=\"a_211\">Section 4</a> be charged at the same trial of any offence under\n         any other law with which he may, under the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_212\">Code of\n         Criminal Procedure</a>, be charged at the same trial. Thus a\n         public servant who is charged of an offence under the\n         provisions of the Act may be charged by the Special Judge\n         at the same trial of any offence under <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_213\">IPC</a> if the same is\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_77\">5</span>\n    (2003) 8 SCC 628\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_78\">                             67</span>\n\n\n\ncommitted in a manner contemplated by Section 220 of the\nCode.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_82\">       14. The only narrow question which remains to be\nanswered is whether any other person who is also charged\nof the same offence with which the co-accused is charged,\nbut which is not an offence specified in <a href=\"/doc/189755549/\" id=\"a_214\">Section 3</a> of the Act,\ncan be tried with the co-accused at the same trial by the\nSpecial Judge. We are of the view that since sub-section (3)\nof <a href=\"/doc/26275631/\" id=\"a_215\">Section 4</a> of the Act authorizes a Special Judge to try any\noffence other than an offence specified in <a href=\"/doc/189755549/\" id=\"a_216\">Section 3</a> of the\nAct to which the provisions of Section 220 apply, there is\nno reason why the provisions of Section 223 of the Code\nshould not apply to such a case. Section 223 in clear terms\nprovides that persons accused of the same offence\ncommitted in the course of the same transaction, or\npersons accused of different offences committed in the\ncourse of the same transaction may be charged and tried\ntogether. Applying the provisions of Sections 3 and 4 of the\nAct and Sections 220 and 223 of the Code of Criminal\nProcedure, it must be held that the appellant and his co-\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_160\">accused may be tried by the Special Judge in the same\ntrial.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_161\">       15. This is because the co-accused of the appellant\nwho have been also charged of offences specified in\n<a href=\"/doc/189755549/\" id=\"a_217\">Section 3</a> of the Act must be tried by the Special Judge,\nwho in view of the provisions of sub-section (3) of <a href=\"/doc/26275631/\" id=\"a_218\">Section 4</a>\nand Section 220 of the Code may also try them of the\ncharge under Section 120-B read with <a href=\"/doc/1436241/\" id=\"a_219\">Section 420</a> IPC. All\nthe three accused, including the appellant, have been\ncharged of the offence under Section 120-B read with\n<a href=\"/doc/1436241/\" id=\"a_220\">Section 420</a> IPC. If the Special Judge has jurisdiction to try\nthe co-accused for the offence under Section 120-B read\nwith <a href=\"/doc/1436241/\" id=\"a_221\">Section 420</a> IPC, the provisions of Section 223 are\nattracted. Therefore, it follows that the appellant who is\nalso charged of having committed the same offence in the\ncourse of the same transaction may also be tried with\nthem. Otherwise it appears rather incongruous that some\nof the conspirators charged of having committed the same\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_79\">                            68</span>\n\n\n\noffence may be tried by the Special Judge while the\nremaining conspirators who are also charged of the same\noffence will be tried by another court, because they are not\ncharged of any offence specified in <a href=\"/doc/189755549/\" id=\"a_222\">Section 3</a> of the Act.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_162\">       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"134248\" id=\"span_80\">16.

We are, therefore, of the view that in the\nfacts and circumstances of this case, the Special\nJudge while trying the co-accused of an offence\npunishable under the provisions of the Act as also an\noffence punishable under Section 120-B read with\n<a href=\"/doc/1436241/\" id=\"a_229\">Section 420</a> IPC has the jurisdiction to try the\nappellant also for the offence punishable under\nSection 120-B read with <a href=\"/doc/1436241/\" id=\"a_230\">Section 420</a> IPC applying\nthe principles incorporated in Section 223 of the\nCode.

The Police\n\nwhile filing the charge sheet have excluded <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_239\">Section 377</a> of the\n\nIPC. The prosecution files application under <a href=\"/doc/1172704/\" id=\"a_240\">Section 216</a> of the\n\nCr.P.C. to alter the charge against the petitioner by including the\n\noffences under <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_241\">Section 377</a> of the IPC. <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_242\">Section 377</a> of the IPC\n\nreads as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_87\">           &quot;377.

Now the complainant sought for\n        framing of charge under <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_247\">Section 377</a> of IPC. <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_248\">Section 377</a> of\n        IPC defines in respect of unnatural offence: Whoever\n        voluntarily has carnal intercourse against the order of\n        nature with any man, woman or animal, shall be punished\n        with imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment of either\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_85\">                             72</span>\n\n\n\ndescription for a term which may extend to ten years, and\nshall also be liable to fine.

However, no\nmaterial is placed in respect of allegations made against\nother five persons named above and also no such\nsupporting documents placed by the complainant to believe\nthe alleged offences against them, except hand written\nletters filed one after another without appearing before the\nCourt and without giving her evidence and also the\nevidence of victim girl. In respect of other two persons viz.,\nShakuntala Sahoo and Jagannath Sahoo-the parents of\naccused No.1, the Hon&#x27;ble High Court has quashed the\nproceedings in        its order dated 03-07-2018 in\nCriminal Revision Petition No.423 of 2018, hence question\nof taking cognizance against them again and again as\nprayed by the complainant does not arise. The application\nlacks bona fide, whatever stand the complainant wants to\ntake against the accused No.1 she has to appear before the\nCourt to give her evidence, if any incriminating evidence\nappeared against the above said five persons as on the\ndate of the incident, then only the cognizance has to be\ntaken against them, but not as prayed by the complainant.\nThe complainant dodging the case without appearing\nbefore the court to give her evidence, even though the trial\ncommenced and the charges framed against the accused\nNo.1. This act of the complainant is not acceptable in this\ncase. Taking into consideration of the entire material facts\nand circumstances as such in the application, objections\nand entire records, this Court feels to observe that the\napplication deserves to be rejected. Accordingly, I hold\npoint No.1 in the &quot;Negative&quot;.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_171\">                                       (Emphasis added)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_86\">                              73</span>\n\n\n\nThe primary reason rendered by the Sessions Judge is that the\n\ncomplainant is not a stranger to the husband -accused No.1 and\n\nshe is his wife.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_172\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_173\">      43.

The allegations clearly make out an\n\noffence punishable under Section 377 of the Code which deals\n\nwith unnatural sex. Therefore, the order under challenge is to\n\nbe set aside allowing the application filed by the prosecution\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1172704/\" id=\"a_253\">Section 216</a> of the Cr.P.C. with a direction to the trial\n\nCourt to frame the charge for the offence punishable under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_254\">Section 377</a> of the IPC as well. The point that has arisen for\n\nconsideration is accordingly answered.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_87\">                              74</span><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_174\">\n\n\n\nPoint No.(vi):\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_175\">           Whether    proceedings    under   the   <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_255\">POCSO    Act</a>\n\n     against the petitioner needs to be interfered with?\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_176\">     44. The aforesaid issue is with regard to interference\n\nagainst the petitioner in the proceedings under the Act.    The\n\ncomplaint, if noticed, would unmistakably highlight the actions\n\nof the petitioner which would touch upon offences under the Act.\n\nThe plea of reverse burden being contrary to the spirit of the\n\nConstitution or the criminal law jurisprudence has already been\n\nnegatived while considering identical provisions of reverse\n\nburden in other enactments and answer to point No.(iii) (supra).\n\nLooking at the complaint allegations as also the written\n\ncommunications of the child which cannot be extracted and\n\nmade a part of the order, would all require a trial against the\n\npetitioner for him to come out clean by projecting such defence\n\nas is available.   Any further observation with regard to the\n\nallegations or the contentions advanced by the learned senior\n\ncounsel insofar as it concerns the allegations qua the Act would\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_88\">                               75</span>\n\n\n\ncome in the way of the defence of the petitioner in the trial.\n\nTherefore, in my considered view, even for the offences under the\n\nAct a full blown trial is necessary in the facts and circumstances\n\nof the case.

The petition was preferred on 23-03-2017. In the light of\n\nthe subsequent order passed in the companion petitions, the\n\nprayer sought in this petition need not be gone into at this stage.\n\nHowever, it is open to the petitioner-victim to file any such\n\napplication before the competent Court where the trial would\n\nbegin and be in progress.

The petitioner and the complainant-victim were\n\nacquaintances. It is the case of the prosecution that the\n\ncomplainant and her senior college-mate Miss.Kinneri Loth had\n\nbeen to Fusion Lounge, a pub on M.G.Road on 7-10-2016. At\n\nabout 10 p.m. they were introduced to two boys who were\n\nknown to the friend of the complainant. After they left the pub\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_90\">                               77</span>\n\n\n\nthe friend of the victim told the victim that the boys whom she\n\nhas introduced will drop her in their car. At around 10.15 p.m.\n\naccused No.1 took the victim to his house. The petitioner was\n\nalso accompanied by the friend and they appear to have had\n\ndinner in the house of accused No.1. After the dinner the friend\n\nof the victim having drunk too much of alcohol slept inside the\n\nbedroom and the complainant was still sitting on the sofa.\n\nAccused No.1 again offered alcohol to the complainant and the\n\ncomplainant began to drink, at which point in time, the\n\npetitioner/accused No.2 began to fondle her by touching her on\n\nall parts of the body and tried to molest her. The complainant\n\nresisted and gets up from the sofa. It is at that point in time\n\naccused No.1 dragged the complainant into the room and\n\ncommits forcible sexual intercourse/rape. It is the case of the\n\nprosecution that after committing such rape accused No.1\n\nthreatened not to divulge the incident to the Police. Since\n\nparents of the complainant were in Iran, she did not lodge any\n\ncomplaint immediately, but on 19-10-2016, she did lodge a\n\ncomplaint before the jurisdictional police for offences punishable\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_91\">                               78</span>\n\n\n\nunder Sections 376, 506 and 511 r/w <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_260\">Section 34</a> of the IPC and\n\n<a href=\"/doc/26275631/\" id=\"a_261\">Sections 4</a>, <a href=\"/doc/188860642/\" id=\"a_262\">8</a>, <a href=\"/doc/81635226/\" id=\"a_263\">16</a> and <a href=\"/doc/123116456/\" id=\"a_264\">18</a> of the Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_185\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_186\">     48. The contention of the learned senior counsel appearing\n\nfor the petitioner is that the petitioner is innocent as he did not\n\ncommit any forcible sexual intercourse upon the victim. It is\n\nonly accused No.1 who is alleged to have dragged into the room\n\nand committed such act of rape and therefore, he should not be\n\ntried for offences under <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_265\">Section 376</a> of the IPC as he has not\n\ncommitted ingredients of offences punishable under <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_266\">Section 375</a>\n\nof the IPC and any of the provisions of the Act. The allegation is\n\nonly that he has tried to touch the body, but the girl refused and\n\nwent away. He would submit that if trial is permitted against the\n\npetitioner it would result in miscarriage of justice, as the\n\npetitioner is a student of B-Pharma.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_187\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_188\">     49.   On   the   other   hand,    the   learned   High   Court\n\nGovernment Pleader appearing for the State would vehemently\n\nrefute the submissions and contends that, it is a matter of trial\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_92\">                               79</span>\n\n\n\nas the petitioner had indulged himself in an act that would\n\ntouch upon the offence of rape. If the evidence is not convincing\n\nhe would always be acquitted of the charge. In a case of this\n\nnature, this Court would not generally interfere in exercise of its\n\njurisdiction under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_189\">     50. I have       given my anxious consideration to the\n\nsubmissions made by the respective learned senior counsel and\n\nthe learned High Court Government Pleader and perused the\n\nmaterial on record.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_190\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_191\">     51. The afore-narrated facts are not in dispute. The\n\nallegations against the petitioner and accused No.1 are for\n\noffences punishable under <a href=\"/doc/180217/\" id=\"a_267\">Sections 506</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_268\">376</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1185693/\" id=\"a_269\">511</a> and <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_270\">34</a> of the\n\nIPC along with offences under the Act. It is not in dispute that\n\nthe victim was below 18 years and the Act becomes applicable to\n\nthe case.   The graphic details with which the complaint is\n\nregistered as narrated hereinabove would not enure to the\n\nbenefit of the petitioner to contend that he has nothing to do in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_93\">                                 80</span>\n\n\n\nthe entire episode of rape against the victim.        The role of the\n\npetitioner would come about only in a full-fledged trial.           After\n\nfiling of the charge sheet the petitioner files an application\n\nseeking discharge on the ground that on perusal of entire charge\n\nsheet    material   and   looking    into   the   submission   of    the\n\ncomplainant-victim there are no materials for the alleged\n\noffences against him.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_192\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_193\">        52. The Sessions Court considering the documents that\n\nwere placed by the prosecution clearly narrates that accused\n\nNo.2 has given a statement before the doctor that accused No.1\n\nhad sexual intercourse with the victim and the same was\n\nprovoked by accused No.2. Accused No.2 also tried to have\n\nsexual intercourse with the victim. Since she refused the only\n\nact that he committed was touching private parts of her body.\n\nThis statement is also signed by accused No.2. Therefore, this\n\nbeing the evidence, it is only a matter of trial in which accused\n\nNo.2 will have to come out clean for the offence punishable\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_271\">Section 376</a> of the IPC and be tried for other offences\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_94\">                                      81</span>\n\n\n\nunder the Act or the Code. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"10151882\" id=\"span_95\">There are serious disputed questions\n\nof fact that are to be thrashed out only in a trial, as the\n\npetitioner was the one who accompanied the victim to the house\n\nof accused No.1 and it is the petitioner who first provoked the\n\nvictim to have sexual intercourse as is alleged. Therefore, these\n\nfactors will have to come out only in a full blown trial. There is\n\nno warrant to interfere at this stage in the light of the allegations\n\nunder the Act as well. The Apex Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/10151882/\" id=\"a_272\">KAPTAN\n\nSINGH v.

At the outset, it is required to be noted that in\n         the present case the High Court in exercise of powers\n         under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_273\">Section 482</a> CrPC has quashed the criminal\n         proceedings for the offences under <a href=\"/doc/1258372/\" id=\"a_274\">Sections 147</a>, <a href=\"/doc/763672/\" id=\"a_275\">148</a>, <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_276\">149</a>,\n         <a href=\"/doc/988620/\" id=\"a_277\">406</a>, <a href=\"/doc/430601/\" id=\"a_278\">329</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1183069/\" id=\"a_279\">386</a> IPC.

The\nHigh Court has lost sight of crucial aspects which\nhave emerged during the course of the investigation.\nThe High Court has failed to appreciate and consider\nthe fact that the document i.e. a joint notarised\naffidavit of Mamta Gupta Accused 2 and Munni Devi\nunder which according to Accused 2 Ms Mamta\nGupta, Rs 25 lakhs was paid and the possession was\ntransferred to her itself is seriously disputed.

It is a\nregistered document. The aforesaid are all triable\nissues/allegations which are required to be\nconsidered at the time of trial.

However, when the payment of Rs 25 lakhs as\nmentioned in the joint notarised affidavit is seriously\ndisputed and even one of the cheques out of 5\ncheques each of Rs 2 lakhs was dishonoured and\naccording to the accused they were handed over the\npossession (which is seriously disputed) it can be\nsaid to be entrustment of property. Therefore, at this\nstage to opine that no case is made out for the\noffence under <a href=\"/doc/988620/\" id=\"a_303\">Section 406</a> IPC is premature and the\naforesaid aspect is to be considered during trial. It is\nalso required to be noted that the first suit was filed\nby Munni Devi and thereafter subsequent suit came\nto be filed by the accused and that too for permanent\ninjunction only.

Ours is a nation governed by the\n\nConstitution.   <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_318\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India pervades\n\nthrough the soul of every statute and every bead of decision\n\nmaking. There is no statute promulgated post the Constitution\n\nwhere there is no application of concept of equality as enshrined\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_110\">                               88</span>\n\n\n\nin <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_319\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India. The Constitution is not\n\na statute, but is the fountain head of all statutes. If the\n\nConstitution mandates equality, the statute ought to follow suit.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_100\">If a man, a husband, a man he is, can be exempted of allegation\n\nof commission of ingredients of <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_320\">Section 375</a> of the IPC,\n\ninequality percolates into such provision of law. Therefore, it\n\nwould run counter to what is enshrined in <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_321\">Article 14</a> of the\n\nConstitution. All human beings under the Constitution are to be\n\ntreated equal, be it a man, be it a woman and others. Any\n\nthought of inequality, in any provision of law, would fail the test\n\nof <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_322\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution. Woman and man being equal\n\nunder the Constitution cannot be made unequal by Exception-2\n\nto <a href=\"/doc/623254/\" id=\"a_323\">Section 375</a> of the IPC. It is for the law makers to ponder over\n\nexistence of such inequalities in law. For ages man donning the\n\nrobes of a husband has used the wife as his chattel; butt his\n\ncrude behavior notwithstanding his existence because of a\n\nwoman. The age old thought and tradition that the husbands\n\nare the rulers of their wives, their body, mind and soul should\n\nbe effaced. It is only on this archaic, regressive and preconceived\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_111\">                                89</span>\n\n\n\nnotion, the cases of this kind are mushrooming in the nation.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_101\">This is in fact in public domain. A brutal act of sexual assault on\n\nthe wife, against her consent, albeit by the husband, cannot but\n\nbe termed to be a rape. Such sexual assault by a husband on\n\nhis wife will have grave consequences on the mental sheet of the\n\nwife, it has both psychological and physiological impact on her.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_102\">Such acts of husbands scar the soul of the wives. It is, therefore,\n\nimperative for the law makers to now &quot;hear the voices of\n\nsilence&quot;.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_202\">     54.
